Requests for FMAGs are made by governors when fires threaten to become major disasters, and must include cost estimates and details about the fire. FEMA evaluates requests using criteria such as threat to lives and property, availability of resources, and fire danger conditions. Fire cost thresholds determine eligibility, with individual and cumulative thresholds varying by state. Appeals can be filed if assistance is denied, and states have 30 days to submit appeals. FMAGs are funded through FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund, which is a no-year account. The cost-share for FMAGs is 75% federal and 25% local. Eligible expenses include equipment, supplies, mobilization, emergency work, and personal comfort items. Hazard mitigation grants are now available for FMAG declarations, providing up to 15% of disaster assistance funds.

The standing rules of the House include several different parliamentary mechanisms that the body may use to act on bills and resolutions. Which of these will be employed in a given instance usually depends on the extent to which Members want to debate and amend the legislation. In general, all of the procedures of the House permit a majority of Members to work their will without excessive delay. The House considers most legislation by motions to suspend the rules, with limited debate and no floor amendments, with the support of at least two-thirds of the Members voting. Occasionally, the House will choose to consider a measure on the floor by the unanimous consent of Members. The Rules Committee is instrumental in recommending procedures for considering major bills and may propose restrictions on the floor amendments that Members can offer or bar them altogether. Many major bills are first considered in Committee of the Whole before being passed by a simple majority vote of the House. The Committee of the Whole is governed by more flexible procedures than the basic rules of the House, under which a majority can vote to pass a bill after only one hour of debate and with no floor amendments. Although a quorum is supposed to be present on the floor when the House is conducting business, the House assumes a quorum is present unless a quorum call or electronically recorded vote demonstrates that it is not. However, the standing rules preclude quorum calls at most times other than when the House is voting. Questions are first decided by voice vote, although any Member may then demand a division vote.

They brainstormed ideas for the remote control, focusing on reducing clutter, incorporating a menu-based system, and ensuring high battery life. The team agreed that the design should be accessible to new users while maintaining a modern aesthetic. They also noted that tribes have the same rights as states to request assistance under the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013. The group concluded by assigning specific tasks and setting deadlines for further development. The discussion highlighted the importance of collaboration and clear communication among team members to achieve the project goals. The team emphasized the need for a user-friendly interface and innovative features to differentiate their product from existing remote controls.

The meeting concluded with a reminder to carry back the laptops and unplug any devices. The team expressed enthusiasm for the project and looked forward to the next steps. The discussion covered the process of requesting and evaluating Fire Management Assistance Grants (FMAGs) for wildfire suppression, including the criteria and thresholds for eligibility. The team learned that FMAGs can be requested by states or tribes when a fire threatens to become a major disaster, and that the request must include cost estimates and information about the fire. They also discovered that there are two types of fire cost thresholds: individual and cumulative, with varying amounts based on the state. The team understood that states have one opportunity to appeal a denial of assistance, and that the process involves submitting additional information to strengthen the original request. The group noted that FMAGs are funded through FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund and that the decision to issue a grant is not contingent on the fund balance. They also learned that FMAGs do not reduce the amount of funding available for major disasters and that the cost-share for FMAGs is 75% for the federal government and 25% for the state.

{"pred": " \n\nThe Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended by the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), authorizes grant programs to support employment and independent living for individuals with disabilities, including the State Vocational Rehabilitation Services program. This program aims to help individuals with disabilities prepare for and obtain employment. Key aspects include the provision of pre-employment transition services to students with disabilities, requiring states to reserve at least 15% of their VR allotment for these services. States must provide a 21.3% non-federal match of these funds. Since WIOA’s enactment in 2014, state VR agencies have generally expanded services for students with disabilities, though challenges remain in fully utilizing reserved funds and updating interagency agreements with state educational agencies. Despite efforts by Education to provide guidance and technical assistance, states face uncertainties regarding allowable expenditures for pre-employment transition services. Additionally, while most state VR agencies have taken steps to train staff and update interagency agreements, challenges persist in coordinating services and balancing pre-employment transition services with other VR services. Education has established timeframes for providing additional information on allowable expenditures, but more action is needed to ensure states can efficiently and effectively coordinate services to students with disabilities. The report concludes that better communication and clearer guidance from Education are necessary to address these challenges and improve the implementation of pre-employment transition services. Key evidence includes survey responses from 74 state VR agencies indicating mixed progress in implementing pre-employment transition services and challenges in using reserved funds and updating interagency agreements. Unique points include the emphasis on the importance of interagency collaboration and the need for Education to provide clearer guidance on allowable expenditures. Education's response acknowledges the need for improved guidance but emphasizes that the PERM methodology is not intended to measure all Medicaid program integrity risks. The report highlights the limitations of the PERM in capturing overpayments and unallowable costs in Medicaid managed care, which could inflate future capitation rates and federal spending. Recommendations include revising the PERM methodology or focusing additional audit resources on managed care to better measure program integrity risks. Key evidence includes findings from 16 federal and state audits and 11 notices of investigations of Medicaid managed care organizations and providers, which reveal overpayments and unallowable costs not accounted for in the PERM. Unique points include the need for better measurement of program risks in Medicaid managed care to ensure the integrity of the program. The report concludes that CMS should consider and take steps to mitigate the program risks that are not measured in the PER", "answers": ["WIOA requires states to reserve at least 15 percent of their total State Vocational Rehabilitation Services program funds to provide pre-employment transition services to help students with disabilities transition from school to work. GAO was asked to review how states were implementing these services. This report examines (1) steps states reported taking to implement pre-employment transition services, and (2) implementation challenges states reported and how Education has addressed them. GAO reviewed documents and funding data from Education, and federal laws and regulations; surveyed all 79 state VR agencies (74 responded); held discussion groups with representatives of 29 state VR agencies; and interviewed officials from Education and three states (Idaho, Illinois, and Maryland) GAO selected for variety in size and type of agencies, among other factors. Of the 74 state vocational rehabilitation (VR) agencies that responded to GAO's survey, most reported expanding services to help students with disabilities transition from school to work as required under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), enacted in July 2014. Most state agencies reported serving more students and providing work-based learning experiences and other activities, referred to as pre-employment transition services (see figure). State VR agencies reported two key challenges with implementing pre-employment transition services for students as required by WIOA. Spending reserved funds : States reported spending about $357 million out of the $465 million reserved for these services in fiscal year 2016. Education officials said that states had difficulty determining what expenditures were allowable, and some state officials said they would like more detailed information from Education. Education officials said they plan to clarify guidance but have no timeframe for providing further information, which would help states to better plan their use of reserved funds. Finalizing interagency agreements : Fewer than half the state VR agencies that responded to GAO's survey (34 of 74) reported updating their interagency agreement with their state's educational agency. Interagency agreements can help promote collaboration by, for example, establishing roles and responsibilities of each agency. Although Education offers technical assistance on interagency agreements, without increased efforts to raise awareness about the importance of these agreements and provide assistance to states where needed, Education may miss opportunities to help state VR and educational agencies efficiently and effectively coordinate services. In addition, WIOA requires Education to highlight best state practices, and most VR agencies responding to GAO's survey (63 of 74) reported this would be useful. Education does not have a written plan or timeframe for identifying and disseminating best practices. As a result, Education may miss opportunities to help more students with disabilities successfully transition from school to work. GAO is recommending that Education (1) establish timeframes for providing additional information on allowable expenditures, (2) take additional steps to assist states that have not updated and finalized their interagency agreements, and (3) develop a written plan with specific timeframes and activities for identifying and disseminating best practices. Education agreed with the first recommendation and disagreed with the other two.

{"pred": " \n\nThe Buy American Act of 1933 aims to promote domestic manufacturing by requiring the federal government to preferentially purchase domestically-made end products. Key exceptions and waivers to this act exist, allowing for the procurement of foreign end products under certain conditions. The federal government obligated approximately $7.8 billion for foreign end products in fiscal year 2017, representing less than 5% of total federal contract obligations for end products. The Department of Defense (DOD) accounted for over 80% of these obligations, primarily for items used outside the U.S. or under the DOD qualifying country exception. Civilian agencies, such as the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), relied more on trade agreements and other exceptions. Challenges in accurately reporting the use of exceptions and waivers in the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG) database were identified, leading to potential inaccuracies in tracking the extent of foreign product procurement. The report recommends improvements in training, guidance, and data recording to enhance compliance with the Buy American Act. Key evidence includes data on procurement values, contract types, and the prevalence of various exceptions and waivers. Unique points include the detailed analysis of procurement practices across different agencies and the identification of system limitations in the FPDS-NG database. Recommendations aim to address these issues and improve the accuracy of data reporting. The report also highlights the importance of providing targeted training and guidance to contracting officers to ensure proper implementation of the Buy American Act requirements. The Office of Management and Budget, DOD, HHS, DHS, and VA were provided with the opportunity to comment on the findings and recommendations. The report concludes that while the Buy American Act exceptions and waivers are widely used, there is room for improvement in their implementation and data reporting. The findings underscore the need for enhanced training, clearer guidance, and improved data recording practices to ensure compliance with the act. The report provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of Buy American Act compliance and offers actionable recommendations to address identified gaps. The analysis reveals significant variations in how different agencies interpret and apply the act, highlighting the need for standardized and robust guidance. The report also underscores the importance of accurate data reporting to support policy decisions and facilitate congressional oversight. The findings suggest that while the act is designed to promote domestic manufacturing, its implementation faces challenges that require attention to ensure its effectiveness. The report concludes with a call for improved training, guidance, and data recording practices to enhance compliance with the Buy American Act. The recommendations aim to address these challenges and improve", "answers": ["The Buy American Act of 1933, as amended, is the main U.S. law promoting domestic purchasing. The Act permits agencies to buy foreign end products only under certain exceptions, such as when domestic items are not available at a reasonable cost. Further, U.S. trade agreements waive the Buy American restrictions for certain products. GAO was asked to review implementation of the Buy American Act. This report assesses the extent to which (1) the federal government procures foreign products through Buy American Act exceptions and waivers; and (2) selected agencies provide training and guidance to implement the Act. GAO reviewed laws, regulations, and policies related to the Buy American Act and analyzed data for fiscal year 2017 from FPDS-NG. GAO also analyzed a non-generalizable sample of 38 contracts from DOD, HHS, DHS, and VA—the agencies with the most obligations for products in fiscal year 2017. The 38 awards selected include a mix of foreign and domestic products, as well as dollars obligated. Finally, GAO interviewed cognizant contracting and policy officials from the selected agencies. According to data reported in the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG) in fiscal year 2017, foreign end products accounted for less than 5 percent—about $7.8 billion—of federal obligations for products potentially subject to the Buy American Act. Federal agencies procured foreign products using exceptions to Buy American Act requirements, as well as through waivers or when the Buy American Act did not apply, as shown in the figure. The amount of foreign end products purchased could be greater than reported in FPDS-NG, however, due to reporting errors and system limitations. GAO found that 6 of the 38 contracts reviewed from the Departments of Defense (DOD), Health and Human Services (HHS), Homeland Security (DHS), and Veterans Affairs (VA) inaccurately recorded waiver or exception information. FPDS-NG system limitations compound these errors because it does not fully capture Buy American Act data. Among other things, the database does not always enable agencies to report the use of exceptions or waivers on contracts for both foreign and domestic products, reducing data accuracy. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is considering strategies to improve Buy American Act data. The four agencies GAO reviewed varied in their approaches to Buy American Act training and guidance. DOD reports that it will have trained more than 18,000 personnel by the end of 2018. DHS reports training almost 1,400 people—approximately 94 percent of its contracting staff—as of April 2018. Some VA courses mention the Act, but none is focused specifically on implementing its requirements. HHS does not have agency-level training or guidance on the Act. GAO found that contracting officers for the contracts it reviewed face challenges implementing Buy American Act requirements. Having specific and targeted Buy American Act guidance and training can better ensure that agencies meet the Act's requirements. GAO is recommending that OMB take steps to improve Buy American Act data and that HHS, DHS, and VA improve agency guidance and training on implementing the Act. All of the agencies either concurred or generally concurred with GAO's recommendations."], "length": 25217}
{"pred": " \n\nThis report discusses the federal Black Lung Disability Trust Fund, which finances benefits for coal miners affected by black lung disease. The trust fund primarily receives revenue from an excise tax on coal, but this tax rate has decreased, leading to financial strain. Key points include:\n\n1. The Black Lung Disability Trust Fund supports coal miners with black lung disease, with benefits paid through Part C of the Black Lung Benefits Act. The trust fund faces financial challenges due to declining coal production and excise tax rates.\n\n2. The excise tax on coal, which finances the trust fund, has been reduced, leading to insufficient revenue to cover obligations. The trust fund has accumulated debt and continues to borrow from the general fund.\n\n3. The trust fund's debt is projected to increase over time, even as cumulative debt is paid down, due to anticipated trust fund revenues not being sufficient to cover anticipated expenditures.\n\n4. Policy options to improve the trust fund's financial condition include increasing the excise tax on coal, forgiving trust fund interest or debt, or reducing federal black lung benefits. The report recommends extending the current excise tax rates or increasing them to address the shortfall in revenue. Unique points include the detailed breakdown of the trust fund's revenue sources and the projected financial outlook, highlighting the need for policy action to ensure the trust fund's sustainability. The report also emphasizes the importance of maintaining the link between the coal industry and the financial burden of black lung benefits.

The report underscores", "answers": ["The federal government pays benefits to coal miners affected by coal workers' pneumoconiosis (CWP, commonly referred to as black lung disease) and other lung diseases linked to coal mining in cases where responsible mine operators are not able to pay. In 2019, the monthly benefit for a miner with no dependents is $660.10. Benefits can be as much as $1,320.10 per month for miners with three or more dependents. Medical benefits are provided separately from disability benefits. Benefit payments and related administrative expenses in cases in which the responsible operators do not pay are paid out of the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund. The primary source of revenue for the trust fund is an excise tax on coal produced and sold domestically. If excise tax revenue is not sufficient to finance Black Lung Program benefits, the trust fund may borrow from the general fund of the Treasury. For 2018, the tax rates on coal were $1.10 per ton of underground-mined coal or $0.55 per ton of surface-mined coal, limited to 4.4% of the sales price. These rates were established in 1986. Starting in 2019, under current law, these tax rates are $0.50 per ton of underground-mined coal or $0.25 per ton of surface-mined coal, limited to 2% of the sales price. These are the rates that were set when the trust fund was established in 1977. The decline in the excise tax rates will likely put additional financial strain on a trust fund that already borrows from the general fund to meet obligations. The decline in domestic coal production, recent increases in the rate of CWP, and bankruptcies in the coal sector also contribute to the financial strain on the trust fund. The Black Lung Disability Trust Fund and associated excise tax on coal were established so that the coal industry, as opposed to taxpayers in general, would bear the burden associated with providing black lung benefits. Throughout its history, the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund has not raised revenues sufficient to meet obligations. As a result, at various points in time, Congress and the President have acted to increase the excise tax on coal, forgive or refinance trust fund debt, and modify black lung benefits eligibility. With the rate of the excise tax on coal reduced in 2019, the 116th Congress may again evaluate options for improving the fiscal condition of the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund, or other issues related to providing federal benefits to miners with black lung disease."], "length": 26531}

{"pred": " \n\nFrom October 2013 to March 2017, the five selected VA medical centers failed to document and conduct required reviews of 148 providers' clinical care after concerns were raised about their care. Specifically, the VA medical centers lacked documentation for 26 providers who required focused professional practice evaluations (FPPEs) for cause and for 8 providers who required retrospective reviews. Additionally, the VA medical centers did not initiate reviews for 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after concerns were raised. The VA medical centers also inadequately reported providers to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) and state licensing boards, as required by VHA policy. Key evidence includes documentation showing that providers had significant clinical deficiencies and that VA medical center officials were generally unfamiliar with or misinterpreted VHA policies related to NPDB and state licensing board reporting. Unique points include the lack of a timeliness requirement for initiating reviews and inadequate oversight by VHA. Recommendations include requiring documentation of all reviews, establishing a timeliness requirement, and strengthening oversight by requiring networks to oversee VA medical centers. The VA concurred with these recommendations and plans to revise existing policy and update the standardized audit tool. The summary highlights the inadequacies in the VA medical centers' review and reporting processes and the need for improved oversight and documentation to ensure patient safety and proper accountability. The VA's failure to report providers to the NPDB and state licensing boards as required facilitates providers who provide substandard care at one facility obtaining privileges at another VA medical center or at hospitals outside of VA's health care system. The VA's plans to strengthen oversight and documentation are crucial for improving patient safety and ensuring that providers who fail to meet clinical standards are appropriately addressed.

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (VAMC) officials are responsible for reviewing the clinical care delivered by their privileged providers—physicians and dentists who are approved to independently perform specific services—after concerns are raised. The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care. For example, GAO found that after one VAMC failed to report to the NPDB or SLBs a provider who resigned to avoid an adverse privileging action, a non-VA hospital in the same city took an adverse privileging action against that same provider for the same reason 2 years later."], "length": 26879}
{"pred": " \n\nPassage 1 discusses the Department of Defense's (DOD) document services, including printing and reproduction, device procurement, and electronic content management. DOD has taken steps to increase efficiencies, such as implementing a transformation plan for DLA Document Services, reducing the number of office print devices, and increasing the use of electronic content management. However, there are still areas where further gains may be possible, including better managing fragmentation in printing and reproduction services, reducing overlap in procuring print devices, meeting goals to reduce the number of print devices, and consolidating locations that provide mission specialty printing. The report highlights that DOD has not assessed whether DLA Document Services is fulfilling its duties in accordance with DOD Instruction 5330.03, and has not determined whether DLA’s single manager role is the most effective and efficient model for providing printing and reproduction services. Additionally, DOD has not implemented a department-wide approach for acquiring print devices, and DOD components use at least four different sources to acquire them, with costs that vary widely for similar devices. The report also notes that DOD has not demonstrated that it has achieved its goals for print device reductions, and that DLA Document Services may be able to realize additional savings from further consolidating facilities beyond those already identified. The passage concludes by stating that DOD is taking important steps to address these issues, but can do more to build on these gains and ensure that DLA Document Services is providing the best value in obtaining document services. Key evidence includes DOD's efforts to reduce the number of print devices, the transformation plan for DLA Document Services, and the identification of areas where further efficiencies may be possible. Unique points include the recommendation that DOD assess whether DLA Document Services' single manager role is the most effective and efficient model for providing printing and reproduction services. The report also highlights the need for DOD to improve its approach to acquiring print devices and to better manage fragmentation in printing and reproduction services. The passage emphasizes the importance of collecting and analyzing data to inform decisions on facility consolidations and to ensure that DOD is achieving its goals for reducing the number of print devices and realizing cost savings. The report also notes that DOD's O&M budget materials for printing and reproduction activities include information on non-printing activities that make up a much larger portion of its reported spending than printing does, and that these materials omit information that would capture the full scope of DOD's document services mission, such as device procurement and electronic content management.

DLA Document Services has key DOD-wide responsibilities for (1) printing and reproduction, (2) print device procurement, and (3) electronic content management (e.g., digital document repositories). Other DOD components, including the military services, also maintain some document services capabilities at various locations. House Report 115-200 accompanying a bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2018 included a provision for GAO to examine DOD's document services. This report evaluates (1) the progress DOD has made in achieving efficiencies in its document services and opportunities, if any, to achieve further efficiencies, and (2) the extent to which DOD reports accurate financial information about its document services to key stakeholders. GAO reviewed documents and interviewed officials regarding DOD's efficiency initiatives, including DLA Document Services' transformation plan; reviewed print device procurement contracts and pricing information; and analyzed DOD budget data for fiscal years 2012 through 2016. The Department of Defense (DOD) has taken steps to achieve efficiencies in its document services, including implementing a transformation plan to consolidate existing Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Document Services facilities. However, GAO identified four areas where further gains may be possible: Managing fragmentation in printing and reproduction services. DOD has designated DLA Document Services as the single manager for printing and reproduction services, but DOD customers, citing concerns with DLA's services, have also obtained these services directly from the Government Publishing Office and via in-house print facilities (see fig.). DOD has not assessed DLA's performance in this role or whether additional efficiencies may be possible in light of DLA's transformation plan. Reducing overlap in procuring print devices. GAO found that DOD components used at least four different contract sources to acquire print devices. DOD has not assessed which acquisition approach represents the best value; doing so might better position DOD to further reduce its costs. Meeting goals to reduce the number of print devices. DOD and the military services have not demonstrated that they achieved established goals for reducing the number of print devices. Additional controls and assignment of oversight responsibilities to monitor progress could better enable DOD to achieve its cost savings goals, estimated to be millions of dollars annually. Consolidating DLA facilities. DLA is closing or consolidating 74 of its 112 facilities in the United States. However, GAO found that for four of seven types of specialty services, DLA plans to retain facilities that are responsible for less than 5 percent of the total revenue for each of those specialties, which suggests that further consolidations are possible. DOD includes the cost of non-printing activities, such as the purchase of advertising time for recruiting, within its budget materials for printing and reproduction. It does not include costs to acquire print devices and for electronic content management. As a result, DOD and the Congress lack the oversight into total document services costs needed to make informed decisions.

Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, with a focus on the Individual Assistance (IA) program. FEMA evaluates states' or tribes' requests for assistance, using a Regional Administrator's Validation and Recommendation (RVAR) to document information on six regulatory factors: concentration of damages, trauma, special populations, voluntary agency assistance, insurance coverage, and average amount of individual assistance by state. However, FEMA's regional offices do not consistently document all elements of these factors in their RVARs, leading to potential inconsistencies in the evaluation process. The passage highlights that while the RVAR template was introduced in 2012 to ensure consistency, regions still vary in their documentation practices. Additionally, the subjective nature of the IA factors and the lack of clear eligibility thresholds pose challenges for states in determining when to request assistance. The passage concludes with a recommendation for FEMA to evaluate why regions are not consistently documenting all elements of the IA regulatory factors and take corrective steps if necessary. Key evidence includes statistics on the number of IA declarations requested, declared, and denied from 2008 to 2016, and the varying levels of compliance with the RVAR template across regions. Innovative points include the introduction of the RVAR template and the identification of potential areas for improvement in the IA declaration process.

When a state, U.S. territory, or tribe requests IA assistance through a federal disaster declaration, FEMA evaluates the request against regulatory factors, such as concentration of damages, and provides a recommendation to the President, who makes a final declaration decision. GAO was asked to review FEMA's IA declaration process. This report examines (1) the number of IA declaration requests received, declared, and denied, and IA actual obligations from calendar years 2008 through 2016, (2) the extent to which FEMA accounts for the regulatory factors when evaluating IA requests, and (3) any challenges FEMA regions and select states reported on the declaration process and factors and any FEMA actions to revise them. GAO reviewed FEMA's policies, IA declaration requests and obligation data, and FEMA's RVARs from July 2012 through December 2016, the most recent years for which data were available. GAO also reviewed proposed rulemaking comments and interviewed FEMA officials from all 10 regions and 11 state emergency management offices selected based on declaration requests and other factors. From calendar years 2008 through 2016, the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Federal Emergency and Management Agency (FEMA) received 294 Individual Assistance (IA) declaration requests from states, U.S. territories, and tribes to help individuals meet their immediate needs after a disaster. Of these, the President declared 168 and denied 126 requests. Across the various types of IA declaration requests, severe storms (190) were the most common disaster type and drought (1) was among the least common. FEMA obligated about $8.6 billion in IA for disaster declarations during this period. GAO found that FEMA regions did not consistently obtain and document information on all elements of established IA regulatory factors when making IA recommendations to headquarters. Following a declaration request, a FEMA region is to prepare a Regional Administrator's Validation and Recommendation (RVAR)—a document designed to include data on each of the six IA regulatory factors for each declaration request as well as the regional administrator's recommendation. GAO reviewed all 81 RVARs from July 2012—the date FEMA began using the new RVAR template—through December 2016. GAO found that regions did not consistently obtain and document information for the elements required under the six regulatory factors (see table). For example, only 44 of the 81 RVARs documented all elements under the concentration of damage factor. By evaluating why regions are not completing all elements of each current IA regulatory factor, FEMA could identify whether any corrective steps are needed. Officials from the 10 FEMA regions and 11 states GAO interviewed, reported positive relationships with each other, but also cited various challenges with the IA declaration process and regulatory factors. For example, these officials told GAO that there are no established minimum thresholds for IA, making final determinations more subjective and the rationale behind denials unclear. However, as required by the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013, FEMA has taken steps to revise the IA factors by issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking. According to FEMA, the proposed rule aims to provide more objective criteria, clarify the threshold for eligibility, and speed up the IA declaration process. As of April 2018, the proposed rule was still under consideration. According to FEMA officials, they plan to finalize the rule in late 2018; therefore, it is too early to know the extent to which it will address these challenges. GAO recommends that FEMA evaluate why regions are not completing the RVARs for each element of the current IA regulatory factors and take corrective steps, if necessary.

Historical status complicates conversions or disposals, and some buildings are too costly to renovate. VA's Strategic Capital Investment Planning (SCIP) and VA Integrated Planning (VAIP) processes have limitations, such as long timeframes and restricted access to information, hindering effective facility alignment.

DOD has repeatedly applied the BRAC process to reduce the amount of unneeded property that it owns and leases and to save billions of dollars that could be applied to higher priority defense needs. This statement is based on GAO's April 2017 report related to VA facility alignment ( GAO-17-349 ) and numerous GAO reports related to the BRAC process as summarized in a June 2011 testimony ( GAO-11-704T ) and a March 2012 testimony ( GAO-12-513T ). This statement addresses (1) the factors that affect VA's facility alignment and the extent to which VA's capital-planning process facilitates the alignment of facilities with the veterans' population, and (2) the key elements and challenges affecting DOD and the Commission in BRAC 2005. Detailed information on our scope and methodologies for this work can be found in these published products, cited throughout this testimony. Geographic shifts in the veterans' population, changes in health care delivery, aging infrastructure, and limited stakeholder involvement affect the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) efforts to align its services and real property portfolio to meet the needs of veterans. For example, a shift over time from inpatient to outpatient care will likely result in underutilized space once used for inpatient care. Further, the historic status of some VA facilities adds to the complexity of converting or disposing of them. In such instances, it is often difficult and costly for VA to modernize, renovate, and retrofit these older facilities. GAO reported that two of the planning processes VA uses to align its facilities—VA's Strategic Capital Investment Planning (SCIP) and the VA Integrated Planning (VAIP)—have limitations that undermine VA's efforts to achieve its goals. Specifically: VA relies on the SCIP process to plan and prioritize capital projects, but VA routinely asks its facility planners to submit their next year's planned project narratives before knowing if their previous submissions have been funded. The overlapping budget cycle, which is outside of VA's control, combined with other SCIP limitations—including subjective narratives, long time frames, and restricted access to information—make it difficult for VA to rely on SCIP to accurately identify the capital necessary to address its service and infrastructure gaps. VA concurred that it needs to address SCIP limitations that are within its control, as GAO recommended; VA has made some progress in implementing the recommendation has made some progress in implementing the recommendation.\\ The VAIP process is estimated to cost $108 million and to produce market-level service delivery plans and facility master plans. However, the VAIP master plans incorrectly assume that all future growth in services will be provided directly through VA facilities without considering alternatives, such as purchasing care from the community. GAO recommended that VA consider discontinuing the VAIP facility master plans pending an assessment of their value as a facility-planning tool. VA agreed with the recommendation and is implementing it while pursuing a national realignment strategy.. Key elements of the Department of Defense's (DOD) 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process could benefit VA's asset and infrastructure review. The key elements included: (1) establishing goals for the process, (2) developing criteria for evaluating closures and realignments, and (3) establishing an organizational structure to develop closure and realignment options.

{"pred": " \n\nThe GAO report examines deficiencies in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) regarding the documentation and timeliness of reviews of providers' clinical care and the reporting of providers to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) and state licensing boards. From October 2013 to March 2017, five VA medical centers reviewed 148 providers but could not document almost half of these reviews. The report highlights that VHA policy does not mandate documentation for all types of reviews and lacks timeliness requirements for initiating reviews. Additionally, VHA's oversight of these reviews is insufficient, as networks do not routinely monitor such reviews. Consequently, VA medical centers often lack the necessary information to make decisions about providers' privileges and may fail to take appropriate adverse actions. The report recommends that VHA require documentation of all reviews, establish timeliness requirements, and enhance oversight to ensure compliance. Furthermore, the report reveals that only one of nine providers who faced adverse privileging actions or resigned during the review period was reported to the NPDB, and none were reported to state licensing boards as required. Misinterpretations of VHA policies and inadequate network oversight contributed to this issue. The report suggests that VHA should require networks to establish processes for overseeing timely reporting to the NPDB and state licensing boards. The findings underscore the need for improved accountability and transparency in the VHA's provider review and reporting processes to ensure patient safety and prevent substandard care providers from obtaining privileges at other facilities. The report provides detailed evidence and examples to support these conclusions, highlighting the systemic issues within the VHA's current practices. The recommendations aim to address these deficiencies and enhance the VHA's ability to protect veterans' health and safety. The report concludes by emphasizing the importance of robust oversight and adherence to policies to maintain high standards of care in VA medical centers. The GAO's findings and recommendations are crucial for improving the VHA's accountability and ensuring that patient safety remains a top priority. The report's unique contribution lies in its comprehensive analysis of both documentation and reporting deficiencies, offering concrete steps to rectify these issues. The report's detailed evidence and examples provide a strong foundation for the recommendations, making it a valuable resource for policymakers and stakeholders seeking to improve the VHA's provider review and reporting processes. The report's focus on both documentation and reporting deficiencies, along with its emphasis on the need for enhanced oversight, offers a holistic approach to addressing the systemic issues within the VHA's current practices.

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (VAMC) officials are responsible for reviewing the clinical care delivered by their privileged providers—physicians and dentists who are approved to independently perform specific services—after concerns are raised. The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care. For example, GAO found that after one VAMC failed to report to the NPDB or SLBs a provider who resigned to avoid an adverse privileging action, a non-VA hospital in the same city took an adverse privileging action against that same provider for the same reason 2 years later."], "length": 27395}

{"pred": " \n\nPassage 1:\n\nThe passage examines how prices for consumer goods targeted to men and women differ, particularly in personal care products. Key findings include that women's versions of personal care products often sell at higher average prices than men's versions, even when controlling for observable factors like brand, size, and promotional activity. This price difference is attributed to both gender-based marketing strategies and consumer preferences. The study uses Nielsen retail price scanner data from 2016 to analyze 10 categories of personal care products, finding that women's products were priced higher in 5 out of 10 categories. Additionally, the passage discusses the limitations of the study, such as the inability to fully account for all underlying cost differences and consumer preferences. It also highlights the potential for firms to use price differentiation as a strategy to capitalize on gender biases in willingness to pay. The report concludes by noting that while some state and local governments have taken steps to address gender-related price differences, federal agencies have not identified significant consumer concerns about this issue. The study emphasizes the need for further research and consumer education to address potential gender biases in pricing practices. Key evidence includes statistical analyses of retail price data and manual price comparisons from online retailers. Unique points include the discussion of the complex interplay between marketing, consumer preferences, and pricing strategies in gender-targeted products. The passage also notes that while some state and local laws prohibit gender-based price differences, federal agencies have not actively addressed this issue. The study underscores the importance of understanding the factors driving gender-based price differences and the potential for consumer harm. The report calls for more comprehensive data collection and analysis to better understand and mitigate these practices. The passage also highlights the challenges consumers face in identifying and challenging gender-based price differences, suggesting that consumer education and awareness campaigns could play a role in addressing this issue. The study concludes by emphasizing the need for ongoing research and regulatory scrutiny to ensure fair pricing practices for all consumers. The report also notes that while some academic experts and consumer groups have raised concerns about gender-based price differences, these issues have not been widely reported or addressed by federal agencies.

While variation in costs and consumer demand may give rise to such price differences, some policymakers have raised concerns that gender bias may also be a factor. While the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Fair Housing Act prohibit discrimination based on sex in credit and housing transactions, no federal law prohibits businesses from charging consumers different prices for the same or similar goods targeted to different genders. GAO was asked to review gender-related price differences for consumer goods and services sold in the United States. This report examines, among other things, (1) how prices compared for selected goods and services marketed to men and women, and potential reasons for any price differences; (2) what is known about price differences for men and women for products not differentiated by gender, such as mortgages; and (3) the extent to which federal agencies have identified and addressed any concerns about gender-related price differences. To examine these issues, GAO analyzed retail price data, reviewed relevant academic studies, analyzed federal consumer complaint data, and interviewed federal agency officials, industry experts, and academics. Firms differentiate many consumer products to appeal separately to men and women by slightly altering product attributes like color or scent. Products differentiated by gender may sell for different prices if men and women have different demands or willingness to pay for these product attributes. Of 10 personal care product categories (e.g., deodorants and shaving products) that GAO analyzed, average retail prices paid were significantly higher for women's products than for men's in 5 categories. In 2 categories—shaving gel and nondisposable razors—men's versions sold at a significantly higher price. One category—razor blades--had mixed results based on two price measures analyzed, and two others—disposable razors and mass-market perfumes—showed no significant gender price differences. GAO found that the target gender for a product is a significant factor contributing to price differences identified, but GAO did not have sufficient information to determine the extent to which these gender-related price differences were due to gender bias as opposed to other factors, such as different advertising costs. Though the analysis controlled for several observable product attributes, such as product size and packaging type, all underlying differences in costs and demand for products targeted to different genders could not be fully observed. Studies GAO reviewed found limited evidence of gender price differences for four products or services not differentiated by gender—mortgages, small business credit, auto purchases, and auto repairs. For example, with regard to mortgages, women as a group paid higher average mortgage rates than men, in part due to weaker credit characteristics, such as lower average income. However, after controlling for borrower credit characteristics and other factors, three studies did not find statistically significant differences in borrowing costs between men and women, while one found women paid higher rates for certain subprime loans. In addition, one study found that female borrowers defaulted less frequently than male borrowers with similar credit characteristics, and the study suggested that women may pay higher mortgage rates than men relative to their default risk. While these studies controlled for factors other than gender that could affect borrowing costs, several lacked important data on certain borrower risk characteristics, such as credit scores, which could affect analysis of gender disparities. Also, several studies analyzed small samples of subprime loans that were originated in 2005 or earlier, which limits the generalizability of the results. In their oversight of federal antidiscrimination statutes, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, Federal Trade Commission, and Department of Housing and Urban Development have identified limited consumer concerns based on gender-related pricing differences. GAO's analysis of complaint data received by the three agencies from 2012–2017 found that they had received limited consumer complaints about gender-related price differences. The agencies provide general consumer education resources on discrimination and consumer awareness. However, given the limited consumer concern, they have not identified a need to incorporate additional materials specific to gender-related price differences into their existing consumer education resources."], "length": 27052}

GAO analyzed VA's requirements development and contracting processes, and identified key supply chain practices cited by four leading hospital networks. GAO also met with contracting and clinical officials at six medical centers, selected based on high dollar contract obligations in fiscal years 2014-2016 and geographic representation. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) established the Medical Surgical Prime Vendor-Next Generation (MSPV-NG) program to provide an efficient, cost-effective way for its facilities to order supplies, but its initial implementation did not have an overarching strategy, stable leadership, and workforce capacity that could have facilitated medical center buy-in for the change. VA also developed requirements for a broad range of MSPV-NG items with limited clinical input. Further, starting in June 2015, VA planned to award competitive contracts, but instead, 79 percent of the items available for purchase under MSPV-NG were added through non-competitive agreements.

These unconventional policies aimed to stimulate the economy by reducing long-term interest rates and expanding the monetary base. However, they also carried risks, such as inflation and financial instability. The Fed's current", "answers": ["Congress has delegated responsibility for monetary policy to the Federal Reserve (the Fed), the nation's central bank, but retains oversight responsibilities for ensuring that the Fed is adhering to its statutory mandate of \"maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.\" To meet its price stability mandate, the Fed has set a longer-run goal of 2% inflation. The Fed's control over monetary policy stems from its exclusive ability to alter the money supply and credit conditions more broadly. Normally, the Fed conducts monetary policy by setting a target for the federal funds rate, the rate at which banks borrow and lend reserves on an overnight basis. It meets its target through open market operations, financial transactions traditionally involving U.S. Treasury securities. Beginning in 2007, the federal funds target was reduced from 5.25% to a range of 0% to 0.25% in December 2008, which economists call the zero lower bound. By historical standards, rates were kept unusually low for an unusually long time to mitigate the effects of the financial crisis and its aftermath. Starting in December 2015, the Fed has been raising interest rates and expects to gradually raise rates further. The Fed raised rates once in 2016, three times in 2017, and four times in 2018, by 0.25 percentage points each time. In light of increased economic uncertainty and financial volatility, the Fed announced in January 2019 that it would be \"patient\" before raising rates again. The Fed influences interest rates to affect interest-sensitive spending, such as business capital spending on plant and equipment, household spending on consumer durables, and residential investment. In addition, when interest rates diverge between countries, it causes capital flows that affect the exchange rate between foreign currencies and the dollar, which in turn affects spending on exports and imports. Through these channels, monetary policy can be used to stimulate or slow aggregate spending in the short run. In the long run, monetary policy mainly affects inflation. A low and stable rate of inflation promotes price transparency and, thereby, sounder economic decisions. The Fed's relative independence from Congress and the Administration has been justified by many economists on the grounds that it reduces political pressure to make monetary policy decisions that are inconsistent with a long-term focus on stable inflation. But independence reduces accountability to Congress and the Administration, and recent legislation and criticism of the Fed by the President has raised the question about the proper balance between the two. While the federal funds target was at the zero lower bound, the Fed attempted to provide additional stimulus through unsterilized purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities (MBS), a practice popularly referred to as quantitative easing (QE). Between 2009 and 2014, the Fed undertook three rounds of QE. The third round was completed in October 2014, at which point the Fed's balance sheet was $4.5 trillion—five times its precrisis size. After QE ended, the Fed maintained the balance sheet at the same level until September 2017, when it began to very gradually reduce it to a more normal size. The Fed has raised interest rates in the presence of a large balance sheet through the use of two new tools—by paying banks interest on reserves held at the Fed and by engaging in reverse repurchase agreements (reverse repos) through a new overnight facility. In January 2019, the Fed announced that it would continue using these tools to set interest rates permanently, in which case the balance sheet may not get much smaller than its current size of $4 trillion. With regard to its mandate, the Fed believes that unemployment is currently lower than the rate that it considers consistent with maximum employment, and inflation is close to the Fed's 2% goal by the Fed's preferred measure. Even after recent rate increases, monetary policy is still considered expansionary. This monetary policy stance is unusually stimulative compared with policy in this stage of previous expansions, and is being coupled with a stimulative fiscal policy (larger structural budget deficit). Debate is currently focused on how quickly the Fed should raise rates. Some contend the greater risk is that raising rates too slowly at full employment will cause inflation to become too high or cause financial instability, whereas others contend that raising rates too quickly will cause inflation to remain too low and choke off the expansion."], "length": 27641}

Egypt controls the Suez Canal, which is one of the world's most well-known maritime chokepoints, linking the Mediterranean and Red Seas. Egypt, with its population of more than 100 million people, is by far the most populous Arabic-speaking country. Although it may not play the same type of leading political or military role in the Arab world as it has in the past, Egypt may retain some \"soft power\" by virtue of its history, media, and culture. Cairo plays host both to the 22-member Arab League and Al Azhar University, which claims to be the oldest continuously operating university in the world and has symbolic importance as a leading source of Islamic scholarship. Additionally, Egypt's 1979 peace treaty with Israel remains one of the most significant diplomatic achievements for the promotion of Arab-Israeli peace. While people-to-people relations remain cold, the Israeli and Egyptian governments have increased their cooperation against Islamist militants and instability in the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza Strip. Personnel moves and possible amendments to the Egyptian constitution highlight apparent efforts by President Sisi to consolidate power with the help of political allies, including colleagues from Egypt's security establishment. President Sisi has come under repeated international criticism for an ongoing government crackdown against various forms of political dissent and freedom of expression. The Egyptian government has defended its human rights record, asserting that the country is under pressure from terrorist groups seeking to destabilize Arab nation-states. The Trump Administration has tried to normalize ties with the Sisi government that were generally perceived as strained under President Obama. In January 2019, U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo delivered a major policy speech at the American University in Cairo, where he stated, \"And as we seek an even stronger partnership with Egypt, we encourage President Sisi to unleash the creative energy of Egypt's people, unfetter the economy, and promote a free and open exchange of ideas.\" The United States has provided significant military and economic assistance to Egypt since the late 1970s. Successive U.S. Administrations have justified aid to Egypt as an investment in regional stability, built primarily on long-running cooperation with the Egyptian military and on sustaining the 1979 Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty. All U.S. foreign aid to Egypt (or any recipient) is appropriated and authorized by Congress. Since 1946, the United States has provided Egypt with over $83 billion in bilateral foreign aid (calculated in historical dollars—not adjusted for inflation). Annual appropriations legislation includes several conditions governing the release of these funds. All U.S. military aid to Egypt finances the procurement of weapons systems and services from U.S. defense contractors. For FY2019, Congress has appropriated $1.4 billion in total bilateral assistance for Egypt, the same amount it provided in FY2018. For FY2020, the President is requesting a total of $1.382 billion in bilateral assistance for Egypt. Nearly all of the U.S. funds for Egypt come from the FMF account (military aid). In November 2018, the U.S. Defense Department notified Congress of a major $1 billion sale of defense equipment to Egypt, consisting of 10 AH-64E Apache Attack Helicopters, among other things. Beyond the United States, President Sisi has broadened Egypt's international base of support to include several key partners, including the Arab Gulf states, Israel, Russia, and France.

{"pred": " \nThe passage discusses the regulatory burden faced by community banks and credit unions, focusing on three key areas: Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) reporting, Bank Secrecy Act and Anti-Money Laundering (BSA/AML) compliance, and the Truth-in-Lending Act (TILA)-Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) Integrated Disclosure (TRID) requirements. Community banks and credit unions view these regulations as burdensome due to their complexity and the time and resources required for compliance. Despite these challenges, regulators have taken steps to reduce the burden, such as adjusting thresholds for reporting and providing guidance. However, the effectiveness of these measures is not always clear, and some argue that the regulations still create unnecessary compliance costs. The passage also highlights the importance of these regulations in ensuring fair lending practices, detecting discriminatory lending, and supporting law enforcement efforts. Additionally, it notes that while some regulations have increased costs, others have reduced costs for community banks and credit unions. The authors recommend that regulators conduct more rigorous quantitative analyses and cumulative burden assessments to better understand and address the regulatory burden on community banks and credit unions. The passage concludes by emphasizing the need for ongoing efforts to streamline regulations and reduce compliance costs for smaller financial institutions. Key evidence includes the time and resources required for compliance, the complexity of the regulations, and the potential benefits of the regulations in terms of fair lending and law enforcement.

Smaller community banks and credit unions must comply with some of the regulations, but compliance can be more challenging and costly for these institutions. GAO examined (1) the regulations community banks and credit unions viewed as most burdensome and why, and (2) efforts by depository institution regulators to reduce any regulatory burden. GAO analyzed regulations and interviewed more than 60 community banks and credit unions (selected based on asset size and financial activities), regulators, and industry associations and consumer groups. GAO also analyzed letters and transcripts commenting on regulatory burden that regulators prepared responding to the comments. Interviews and focus groups GAO conducted with representatives of over 60 community banks and credit unions indicated regulations for reporting mortgage characteristics, reviewing transactions for potentially illicit activity, and disclosing mortgage terms and costs to consumers were the most burdensome. Institution representatives said these regulations were time-consuming and costly to comply with, in part because the requirements were complex, required individual reports that had to be reviewed for accuracy, or mandated actions within specific timeframes. However, regulators and others noted that the regulations were essential to preventing lending discrimination and use of the banking system for illicit activity, and they were acting to reduce compliance burdens. Institution representatives also said that the new mortgage disclosure regulations increased compliance costs, added significant time to loan closings, and resulted in institutions absorbing costs when others, such as appraisers and inspectors, changed disclosed fees. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) issued guidance and conducted other outreach to educate institutions after issuing these regulations in 2013. But GAO found that some compliance burdens arose from misunderstanding the disclosure regulations—which in turn may have led institutions to take actions not actually required. Assessing the effectiveness of the guidance for the disclosure regulations could help mitigate the misunderstandings and thus also reduce compliance burdens. Regulators of community banks and credit unions—the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the National Credit Union Administration—conduct decennial reviews to obtain industry comments on regulatory burden. But the reviews, conducted under the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996 (EGRPRA), had the following limitations: CFPB and the consumer financial regulations for which it is responsible were not included. Unlike executive branch agencies, the depository institution regulators are not required to analyze and report quantitative-based rationales for their responses to comments. Regulators do not assess the cumulative burden of the regulations they administer. CFPB has formed an internal group that will be tasked with reviewing regulations it administers, but the agency has not publicly announced the scope of regulations included, the timing and frequency of the reviews, and the extent to which they will be coordinated with the other federal banking and credit union regulators as part of their periodic EGRPRA reviews. Congressional intent in mandating that these regulators review their regulations was that the cumulative effect of all federal financial regulations be considered. In addition, sound practices required of other federal agencies require them to analyze and report their assessments when reviewing regulations. Documenting in plans how the depository institution regulators would address these EGRPRA limitations would better ensure that all regulations relevant to community banks and credit unions were reviewed, likely improve the analyses the regulators perform, and potentially result in additional burden reduction. GAO makes a total of 10 recommendations to CFPB and the depository institution regulators. CFPB should assess the effectiveness of guidance on mortgage disclosure regulations and publicly issue its plans for the scope and timing of its regulation reviews and coordinate these with the other regulators' review process. As part of their burden reviews, the depository institution regulators should develop plans to report quantitative rationales for their actions and addressing the cumulative burden of regulations. In written comments, CFPB and the four depository institution regulators generally agreed with the recommendations."], "length": 27483}

This rule has undergone several modifications over time, with the most recent version allowing retrenchments that reduce the number and salary of federal officials, the compensation of persons paid from the Treasury, or the amounts of money covered in an appropriation bill. The 115th Congress reintroduced a separate order to the Holman Rule, expanding its applicability to include reductions in the number and salary of officers, and the compensation of individuals paid from the Treasury.

One such circumstance allows for the inclusion of legislative language in general appropriations bills or amendments thereto for \"germane provisions that retrench expenditures by the reduction of amounts of money covered by the bill.\" This exception appears in clause 2(b) of House Rule XXI and is known as the Holman rule, after Representative William Holman of Indiana, who first proposed the exception in 1876. Since the period immediately after its initial adoption, the House has interpreted the Holman rule through precedents that have tended to incrementally narrow its application. Under current precedents, for a legislative provision or amendment to be in order, the legislative language in question must be both germane to other provisions in the measure and must produce a clear reduction of appropriations in that bill. In addition, the House adopted a separate order during the 115th Congress that provided for retrenchments of expenditures by a reduction of amounts of money covered by the bill to be construed as applying to: any provision or amendment that retrenches expenditures by— (1) the reduction of amounts of money in the bill; (2) the reduction of the number and salary of the officers of the United States; or (3) the reduction of the compensation of any person paid out of the Treasury of the United States.

{"pred": " \n\nPassage 1 discusses the rise in neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) due to prenatal opioid use and the challenges in treating infants with NAS. The passage highlights that NAS is a condition affecting infants born to mothers who used opioids during pregnancy, and it can result in respiratory distress and other symptoms requiring treatment. The text emphasizes that prenatal opioid use can occur through various means, including prescription medications, medication-assisted treatment, and illicit drugs. It notes that medication-assisted treatment is generally considered the standard of care for pregnant women with opioid use disorders, as it can prevent complications associated with illicit opioid use and reduce obstetric complications. The passage outlines the diagnostic process for NAS, primarily using the Finnegan Neonatal Abstinence Scoring Tool, and describes the initial preference for non-pharmacological treatments, such as rooming-in and breastfeeding, before considering pharmacological interventions like methadone or morphine. It also mentions that there is no national standard of care for NAS treatment and that Medicaid is the primary payer for NAS treatment, with infants often treated in hospitals, including neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). The passage identifies several challenges in treating NAS, including the use of multiple substances by pregnant women, stigma faced by women who use opioids, hospital staff burden, and limited coordination of care. Additionally, it highlights the importance of educating both mothers and healthcare providers about NAS and the need for research to develop more consistent treatment protocols. Finally, the passage notes that HHS has published a strategy with recommendations to address NAS, but it lacks a detailed implementation plan, raising concerns about the department's ability to effectively implement these recommendations. The key evidence includes statistics on the prevalence of NAS, the costs associated with treating NAS, and the variations in treatment approaches across different hospital settings. Unique points include the emphasis on the importance of non-pharmacological treatments and the need for standardized protocols in NAS care. The passage underscores the complexity of addressing NAS and the need for coordinated efforts among various stakeholders. The main argument is that while there are existing guidelines and resources, a comprehensive and coordinated approach is necessary to effectively manage NAS and improve outcomes for affected infants and their families. The passage also highlights the role of Medicaid in financing NAS treatment and the challenges in ensuring consistent and effective care across different settings. The unique aspect is the focus on the need for a detailed implementation plan to ensure the successful execution of HHS's strategy. The summary concludes by emphasizing the importance of addressing the challenges in NAS treatment and the need for a coordinated, evidence-based approach. The passage also notes that", "answers": ["As the opioid crisis has increased in recent years, so has the number of pregnant women who use opioids, which can result in NAS. A recent peer-reviewed study found that cases of NAS have grown nearly five-fold between 2000 and 2012 and that most infants with NAS are covered under Medicaid. The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016 includes a provision for GAO to examine NAS in the United States and related treatment services covered under Medicaid. This report 1) describes the hospital and non-hospital settings for treating infants with NAS and how Medicaid pays for services, 2) describes recommended practices and challenges for addressing NAS, and 3) examines HHS's strategy for addressing NAS. GAO reviewed HHS documentation and interviewed HHS officials. GAO also conducted site visits to four states—Kentucky, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin—selected based on several factors, including incidence rates of NAS and geographic variation. GAO interviewed stakeholders from 32 organizations, including health care providers and state officials in the selected states. The prenatal use of opioids or other drugs can produce a withdrawal condition in newborns known as neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). Health care providers, state officials, and other stakeholders told GAO that most infants with NAS are treated in the hospital—such as in a neonatal intensive care unit—though some may be referred to a non-hospital setting—such as a neonatal withdrawal center with nursery rooms—to complete their treatment. The table below provides more information on settings for treating infants with NAS and on how Medicaid pays for services in these settings. According to stakeholders GAO interviewed and literature reviewed, there are several recommended practices and challenges associated with addressing NAS. The most frequently recommended practices included prioritizing non-pharmacologic treatment to infants—treatment that does not involve medications—such as allowing the mother to reside with the infant during treatment; educating mothers and health care providers on treatment of NAS, among other things; and using a protocol in the hospital or non-hospital setting for screening and treating infants with NAS. The most frequently cited challenges included the maternal use of multiple drugs—or polysubstance use—as it can exacerbate NAS symptoms; stigma faced by pregnant women who use opioids; hospital staff burden and limited physical capacity to care for infants with NAS; limited coordination of care for mothers and infants with NAS; and gaps in research and data on NAS, such as research on the long-term effects of the condition. In May 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published a strategy document that makes key recommendations to address NAS. The Strategy recommends, for example, that health care providers receive continuing education on managing and treating infants with NAS and promote non-pharmacologic treatment. According to HHS officials, these recommendations will inform planning and policy across the department. However, HHS has yet to determine how and when the recommendations will be implemented, including establishing priorities; the roles and responsibilities of other federal, state, and public stakeholders; implementation timeframes; and methods for assessing progress. HHS officials told GAO that they expect to develop an implementation plan sometime in 2017 but had no timeline for doing so. Without a plan that clearly specifies how HHS will implement the Strategy and assess its progress, the department increases the risk that its recommendations for addressing NAS will not be implemented. HHS should expeditiously develop a plan for implementing the recommendations included in its strategy related to addressing NAS. HHS concurred that it should expeditiously address NAS, but noted implementation of the strategy is contingent on funding."], "length": 25117}
{"pred": " \n\nThe Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended by the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), authorizes federal grants to support employment and independent living for individuals with disabilities, primarily through the State Vocational Rehabilitation Services program. Since WIOA's enactment in 2014, state VR agencies have expanded services for students with disabilities, particularly in pre-employment transition services. These services aim to help students identify career interests and transition from high school to post-secondary education or employment. Key challenges include underutilization of reserved funds, difficulties in updating interagency agreements with educational agencies, and the need for clearer guidance on allowable expenditures. Despite these challenges, state VR agencies have generally enhanced their services and staff capacity, and begun to coordinate more closely with state educational agencies. However, many states have not used all the funds reserved for pre-employment transition services, and some agencies for the blind have had to restrict VR services while also not being able to use all of the funds reserved for pre-employment transition services for students with disabilities. Education has taken steps to address these challenges, including providing guidance and technical assistance, but more could be done to ensure states efficiently and effectively coordinate services to students with disabilities. Education should establish timeframes for providing states with additional information on allowable expenditures, take additional steps to assist states in updating interagency agreements, and develop a written plan with specific timeframes and activities for identifying and disseminating best practices. These actions would help states better serve students with disabilities who are transitioning from high school. The passage highlights the progress made by state VR agencies in expanding services for students with disabilities, particularly in pre-employment transition services, but also identifies ongoing challenges such as underutilization of funds, difficulties in updating interagency agreements, and the need for clearer guidance on allowable expenditures. Key evidence includes survey responses from 74 state VR agencies indicating that they have generally enhanced their services and staff capacity, but many have not used all the funds reserved for pre-employment transition services. Unique points include the emphasis on the importance of interagency collaboration and the need for Education to provide clearer guidance and support to states. The passage concludes with recommendations for Education to address these challenges and improve the implementation of pre-employment transition services.

GAO reviewed documents and funding data from Education, and federal laws and regulations; surveyed all 79 state VR agencies (74 responded); held discussion groups with representatives of 29 state VR agencies; and interviewed officials from Education and three states (Idaho, Illinois, and Maryland) GAO selected for variety in size and type of agencies, among other factors. Of the 74 state vocational rehabilitation (VR) agencies that responded to GAO's survey, most reported expanding services to help students with disabilities transition from school to work as required under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), enacted in July 2014. Most state agencies reported serving more students and providing work-based learning experiences and other activities, referred to as pre-employment transition services (see figure). State VR agencies reported two key challenges with implementing pre-employment transition services for students as required by WIOA. Spending reserved funds : States reported spending about $357 million out of the $465 million reserved for these services in fiscal year 2016. Education officials said that states had difficulty determining what expenditures were allowable, and some state officials said they would like more detailed information from Education. Education officials said they plan to clarify guidance but have no timeframe for providing further information, which would help states to better plan their use of reserved funds. Finalizing interagency agreements : Fewer than half the state VR agencies that responded to GAO's survey (34 of 74) reported updating their interagency agreement with their state's educational agency. Interagency agreements can help promote collaboration by, for example, establishing roles and responsibilities of each agency. Although Education offers technical assistance on interagency agreements, without increased efforts to raise awareness about the importance of these agreements and provide assistance to states where needed, Education may miss opportunities to help state VR and educational agencies efficiently and effectively coordinate services. In addition, WIOA requires Education to highlight best state practices, and most VR agencies responding to GAO's survey (63 of 74) reported this would be useful. Education does not have a written plan or timeframe for identifying and disseminating best practices. As a result, Education may miss opportunities to help more students with disabilities successfully transition from school to work. GAO is recommending that Education (1) establish timeframes for providing additional information on allowable expenditures, (2) take additional steps to assist states that have not updated and finalized their interagency agreements, and (3) develop a written plan with specific timeframes and activities for identifying and disseminating best practices.

However, only about half of the accrued funds are typically appropriated annually due to the discretionary nature of the appropriations process. Since FY1998, the LWCF has funded three main purposes: federal land acquisition, state outdoor recreation grants, and other purposes.

The fund also receives mandatory appropriations under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (GOMESA). The level of annual appropriations for the LWCF has varied since the origin of the fund in FY1965. The LWCF Act outlines uses of the fund for federal and state purposes. Of the total made available through appropriations or deposits under GOMESA, not less than 40% is to be used for \"federal purposes\" and not less than 40% is to be used to provide \"financial assistance to states.\" The act lists the federal purposes for which the President is to allot LWCF funds \"unless otherwise allotted in the appropriation Act making them available.\" These purposes primarily relate to acquisition of lands and waters (and interests therein) by the federal government. With regard to state purposes, the act authorizes a matching grant program to states for outdoor recreation purposes. Throughout the LWCF's history, appropriations acts typically have provided funds for land acquisition and outdoor recreational grants to states. Beginning in FY1998, appropriations also have been provided each year (except FY1999) to fund other purposes related to natural resources. The extent to which the LWCF should be used for purposes other than federal land acquisition and outdoor recreation grants to states, and which other purposes should be funded from the LWCF, continue to be the subject of legislation and debate in Congress. In the past few decades, Presidents have sought LWCF funds for a variety of other purposes. Congress chooses which if any of these requests to fund, and has chosen programs not sought by the President for a particular year. Among other programs, appropriations have been provided for facility maintenance of the land management agencies, ecosystem restoration, the Historic Preservation Fund, the Payments in Lieu of Taxes program, the Forest Legacy Program, State and Tribal Wildlife Grants (under the Fish and Wildlife Service), the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund, U.S. Geological Survey science and cooperative programs, and Bureau of Indian Affairs Indian Land and Water Claim Settlements. Since FY1998, a total of $2.7 billion has been appropriated for other purposes, of a total LWCF appropriation of $18.9 billion over the history of the fund. The Fish and Wildlife Service and the Forest Service have received the largest shares of the total appropriations for other purposes, about $1.4 billion (53%) and $1.0.billion (38%), respectively, from FY1998 to FY2019. Several agencies shared the remaining $0.2 billion (9%) of the appropriations. Both the dollar amounts and the percentages of annual LWCF appropriations for other purposes have varied widely since FY1998. The dollar amounts have ranged from $0 in FY1999 to $456.0 million in FY2001. The percentage of annual funds provided for other purposes ranged from 0% in FY1999 to a high of 59% in both FY2006 and FY2007. In some years, the appropriation for other purposes was significantly less than the Administration requested. For instance, for FY2008, the George W.

It also directs the reader to other reports providing context for specific component appropriations. As part of an overall DHS budget that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) estimated to be $74.88 billion, the Trump Administration requested $47.43 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority through the appropriations process for DHS for FY2018. The request amounted to a $0.29 billion (0.6%) decrease from the $47.72 billion in annual appropriations enacted for FY2018 through the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141, Division F). The Administration also requested discretionary funding for DHS components that does not count against discretionary spending limits and is not reflected in the adjusted net discretionary budget authority total.

{"pred": " \n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) administers Fire Management Assistance Grants (FMAGs) to provide federal assistance for fire suppression activities on public or private forest land or grassland. FMAGs require a 25% cost-share from state, local, and tribal governments. Requests for FMAGs can be submitted by states or tribes when a fire is burning out of control and threatens to become a major disaster. FEMA evaluates wildfire requests using criteria such as the threat to lives and property, the availability of state and local fire resources, high fire danger conditions, and potential economic impacts. Fire cost thresholds are used to determine eligibility for assistance, with individual and cumulative thresholds varying by state. If a request is denied, the state has one opportunity to appeal the decision. FMAGs are funded through FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) and are not contingent on the DRF balance. The federal share for FMAGs is 75%, with the state and local governments covering the remaining 25%. The process includes a 90-day application period and a 45-day approval period. FMAGs can be used for various eligible expenses, such as equipment, supplies, mobilization, demobilization, emergency work, and personal comfort and safety items. The Forest Service and other federal agencies provide other types of assistance related to wildfire management, but FMAGs are distinct and do not overlap with emergency suppression assistance. The Forest Service does not provide FMAG assistance for fires that begin on federal land, except in cases where there is a mix of federal and nonfederal land and the state has a responsibility for suppression activities under a cooperative agreement.

Key findings include:\n\n1. From October 2013 to March 2017, five VA medical centers conducted reviews for 148 providers but could not document 46% of these reviews, and in some cases, reviews were not conducted at all. Specifically, 26 providers lacked documentation for focused professional practice evaluations (FPPEs) for cause, and 21 providers had required FPPEs for cause that were never conducted. Additionally, 8 providers lacked documentation for retrospective reviews, and 12 providers had no documented reviews despite concerns about their care.\n\n2. Reviews were often delayed, with 16 providers not initiating reviews for 3 months to multiple years after concerns were raised. Two factors contributed to these issues: VHA policy inadequacies, such as lack of documentation requirements for certain reviews and no timeliness requirement for initiating reviews, and insufficient VHA oversight of the credentialing and privileging processes.\n\n3. Only one of nine providers who faced adverse privileging actions or resigned/retired while under investigation was reported to the NPDB, and none were reported to state licensing boards as required. Providers were not reported due to misunderstandings of VHA policies and a lack of network oversight to ensure timely reporting.\n\n4. The report recommends that VHA require documentation of all reviews, establish timeliness requirements, and strengthen oversight by requiring networks to ensure reviews are documented and initiated in a timely manner. Additionally, VHA should require networks to establish processes for overseeing VA medical centers to ensure timely reporting to the NPDB and state licensing boards. The VA concurred with these recommendations and plans to implement them. The report highlights the importance of robust oversight and documentation to ensure patient safety and accountability in healthcare settings. The findings underscore the need for clear policies and effective oversight mechanisms to address deficiencies in provider care and ensure compliance with reporting requirements. The report's emphasis on the inadequacy of current policies and the lack of oversight provides a compelling argument for the proposed changes. The unique aspect of the report is its detailed examination of the specific types of reviews and the consequences of inadequate documentation and reporting, offering concrete evidence of the systemic issues within the VHA.

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (VAMC) officials are responsible for reviewing the clinical care delivered by their privileged providers—physicians and dentists who are approved to independently perform specific services—after concerns are raised. The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care. For example, GAO found that after one VAMC failed to report to the NPDB or SLBs a provider who resigned to avoid an adverse privileging action, a non-VA hospital in the same city took an adverse privileging action against that same provider for the same reason 2 years later."], "length": 27720}

{"pred": " \n\nThe Buy American Act of 1933 aims to promote domestic manufacturing by requiring the federal government to preferentially purchase domestically-made end products. Key exceptions and waivers exist to accommodate certain circumstances, such as when domestic products are not available or when foreign products are sourced from designated countries under trade agreements. The federal government obligated approximately $7.8 billion for foreign end products in fiscal year 2017, representing less than 5% of total federal contract obligations. Agencies face challenges in accurately reporting the use of exceptions and waivers, leading to data inaccuracies. The report recommends improvements in training, guidance, and data recording to enhance compliance with the Buy American Act. Despite these challenges, the act remains a critical tool for supporting domestic industry and job creation. The data analysis reveals that while the majority of foreign end product purchases are made through established exceptions and waivers, there is room for improvement in the consistency and accuracy of reporting. Unique points include the emphasis on the importance of product origin verification and the need for clearer guidance on the applicability of trade agreement waivers. The report also highlights the diverse approaches taken by different agencies in addressing these issues, underscoring the need for standardized practices. The findings suggest that while the Buy American Act is effective, ongoing efforts are necessary to ensure its proper implementation and to maintain transparency in procurement practices. The report concludes by recommending that the Office of Management and Budget, along with specific agencies, take steps to improve training, guidance, and data recording to better align with the act's objectives. This would help ensure that the federal government continues to support domestic manufacturing and job creation while maintaining transparency and accountability in its procurement processes. The data and analysis presented in the report provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of the Buy American Act and highlight areas for improvement. The recommendations aim to address the challenges faced by agencies in implementing the act effectively and efficiently. The report underscores the importance of clear communication and consistent practices to support the act's goals. The findings and recommendations are based on a thorough examination of FPDS-NG data and interviews with agency officials, providing a solid foundation for the proposed improvements. The report also notes that while the act has been effective in promoting domestic manufacturing, there is a need for continued vigilance and adaptation to changing circumstances. Overall, the report provides valuable insights into the implementation of the Buy American Act and offers actionable recommendations to enhance its effectiveness. The summary highlights the key aspects of the report, including the current state of the Buy American Act, the challenges in its implementation, and the proposed solutions to", "answers": ["The Buy American Act of 1933, as amended, is the main U.S. law promoting domestic purchasing. The Act permits agencies to buy foreign end products only under certain exceptions, such as when domestic items are not available at a reasonable cost. Further, U.S. trade agreements waive the Buy American restrictions for certain products. GAO was asked to review implementation of the Buy American Act. This report assesses the extent to which (1) the federal government procures foreign products through Buy American Act exceptions and waivers; and (2) selected agencies provide training and guidance to implement the Act. GAO reviewed laws, regulations, and policies related to the Buy American Act and analyzed data for fiscal year 2017 from FPDS-NG. GAO also analyzed a non-generalizable sample of 38 contracts from DOD, HHS, DHS, and VA—the agencies with the most obligations for products in fiscal year 2017. The 38 awards selected include a mix of foreign and domestic products, as well as dollars obligated. Finally, GAO interviewed cognizant contracting and policy officials from the selected agencies. According to data reported in the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG) in fiscal year 2017, foreign end products accounted for less than 5 percent—about $7.8 billion—of federal obligations for products potentially subject to the Buy American Act. Federal agencies procured foreign products using exceptions to Buy American Act requirements, as well as through waivers or when the Buy American Act did not apply, as shown in the figure. The amount of foreign end products purchased could be greater than reported in FPDS-NG, however, due to reporting errors and system limitations. GAO found that 6 of the 38 contracts reviewed from the Departments of Defense (DOD), Health and Human Services (HHS), Homeland Security (DHS), and Veterans Affairs (VA) inaccurately recorded waiver or exception information. FPDS-NG system limitations compound these errors because it does not fully capture Buy American Act data. Among other things, the database does not always enable agencies to report the use of exceptions or waivers on contracts for both foreign and domestic products, reducing data accuracy. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is considering strategies to improve Buy American Act data. The four agencies GAO reviewed varied in their approaches to Buy American Act training and guidance. DOD reports that it will have trained more than 18,000 personnel by the end of 2018. DHS reports training almost 1,400 people—approximately 94 percent of its contracting staff—as of April 2018. Some VA courses mention the Act, but none is focused specifically on implementing its requirements. HHS does not have agency-level training or guidance on the Act. GAO found that contracting officers for the contracts it reviewed face challenges implementing Buy American Act requirements. Having specific and targeted Buy American Act guidance and training can better ensure that agencies meet the Act's requirements. GAO is recommending that OMB take steps to improve Buy American Act data and that HHS, DHS, and VA improve agency guidance and training on implementing the Act.

Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act authorizes the President to declare a Fire Management Assistance Grant (FMAG) for fire suppression activities on public or private forest land or grassland. These grants require a 25% cost-share from state, local, and tribal governments. Tribes are eligible to request FMAGs, but some tribal lands are managed by the federal government and receive support through the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC). FMAG requests must include detailed information about the fire, such as size, population threatened, and weather conditions. FEMA evaluates requests using criteria like threat to lives and property, availability of resources, and fire danger indices. Fire cost thresholds determine eligibility, with individual and cumulative thresholds varying by state. States can appeal denied requests within 30 days. FMAGs are funded through FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund, which is a no-year account. The cost-share for FMAGs is 75% federal and 25% from the grantee. Eligible expenses include equipment, supplies, mobilization, emergency work, and personal comfort items. Hazard mitigation grants are now available for FMAG declarations. FMAGs are distinct from emergency suppression assistance from federal agencies, which are responsible for suppression operations on federal lands. Cooperative agreements between federal, state, and tribal partners can facilitate joint wildfire protection and response activities.

The Navy aims to achieve and maintain a fleet of 355 ships, with a mix of aircraft carriers, submarines, destroyers, and other types of ships. The 355-ship goal is the result of a Force Structure Assessment (FSA) conducted by the Navy in 2016, which considers the types and amounts of Navy capabilities needed for implementing the Navy's portion of the national military strategy. The Navy's FY2020 budget requests funding for 12 new ships, including one aircraft carrier, three attack submarines, three destroyers, one frigate, two oilers, and two towing, salvage, and rescue ships. The Navy is also considering a new FSA, which could potentially change the 355-ship figure, the planned mix of ships, or both. The Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan includes 304 new ships, with an average of 10 new ships per year. The plan is based on key assumptions and planning factors, including ship construction times and service lives, estimated ship procurement costs, projected shipbuilding funding levels, and industrial-base considerations. The plan's prospective affordability is a matter of oversight focus, especially during the decade from the mid-2020s through the mid-2030s, when the plan calls for procuring Columbia-class ballistic missile submarines as well as replacements for large numbers of retiring attack submarines, cruisers, and destroyers. The Navy's FY2020 30-year shipbuilding plan would require roughly $24 billion per year in shipbuilding funds during that period. The plan's cost estimates have been subject to scrutiny, with the Congressional Budget Office estimating the cost to be higher than the Navy's estimates. The plan's industrial base capacity and employment impact are also discussed, with the Navy indicating that it has the capacity to build the additional ships needed to achieve and maintain the 355-ship fleet. The passage concludes by noting that the Navy's proposed FY2020 budget requests funding for 12 new ships, and that Congress will need to decide whether to approve, reject, or modify the Navy's proposed shipbuilding program and longer-term plans.

The 355-ship force-level goal is the result of a Force Structure Assessment (FSA) conducted by the Navy in 2016. The Navy states that a new FSA is now underway as the successor to the 2016 FSA. This new FSA, Navy officials state, is to be completed by the end of 2019. Navy officials have suggested in their public remarks that this new FSA could change the 355-ship figure, the planned mix of ships, or both. The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget requests funding for the procurement of 12 new ships, including one Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) class aircraft carrier, three Virginia-class attack submarines, three DDG-51 class Aegis destroyers, one FFG(X) frigate, two John Lewis (TAO-205) class oilers, and two TATS towing, salvage, and rescue ships. The Navy's FY2020 five-year (FY2020-FY2024) shipbuilding plan includes 55 new ships, or an average of 11 new ships per year. The Navy's FY2020 30-year (FY2020-FY2049) shipbuilding plan includes 304 ships, or an average of about 10 per year. If the FY2020 30-year shipbuilding plan is implemented, the Navy projects that it will achieve a total of 355 ships by FY2034. This is about 20 years sooner than projected under the Navy's FY2019 30-year shipbuilding plan—an acceleration primarily due to a decision announced by the Navy in April 2018, after the FY2019 plan was submitted, to increase the service lives of all DDG-51 destroyers to 45 years. Although the Navy projects that the fleet will reach a total of 355 ships in FY2034, the Navy in that year and subsequent years will not match the composition called for in the FY2016 FSA. One issue for Congress is whether the new FSA that the Navy is conducting will change the 355-ship force-level objective established by the 2016 FSA and, if so, in what ways.

{"pred": " \n\nPassage 1 discusses the management of personal property by federal agencies, particularly focusing on the identification and disposal of unneeded property. The passage highlights that while agencies are required to maintain adequate inventory controls and dispose of excess property, many do not have systematic processes for identifying unneeded property. Key evidence includes the fact that five selected agencies did not have policies or systematic processes for continually surveying property to identify excess, and that they largely relied on \"triggering events\" such as office moves or lifecycle replacements to declare property as excess. Unique points include the recommendation that the Director of OMB should provide guidance to executive agencies on managing their personal property, emphasizing the need to continuously review and identify unneeded personal property. The passage also notes that the lack of systematic processes can lead to inefficiencies and missed opportunities for cost savings, as well as the potential for property to be retained unnecessarily. The Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended, mandates that agencies promptly report excess property to GSA and dispose of it in accordance with GSA regulations. GSA's disposal process includes four stages: transfer to another agency or eligible recipient, donation, sale, or abandonment or destruction. Agencies are encouraged to use existing property or obtain excess property from other federal agencies before purchasing new property. The passage concludes by noting that while agencies have been able to manage personal property disposals from space reduction projects, they have identified factors that can impact the efficient use of the disposal process during such projects. The key evidence includes the challenges faced by agencies in managing personal property during space reduction projects, such as inventorying non-accountable property and managing disposals within time frames.

By law, each agency is required to follow GSA's disposal process so that an agency's unneeded property can be used by other agencies or certain non-federal entities. Since 2012, agencies have reduced their office and warehouse space due to government-wide initiatives, a reduction that in turn has required agencies to dispose of some affected personal property. GAO was asked to review how federal agencies identify and dispose of unneeded personal property. This report examines (1) how selected agencies assess whether personal property is needed and (2) how these agencies dispose of unneeded property and how, if at all, space reduction efforts have affected disposals. GAO reviewed federal statutes and regulations, and selected five agencies—EPA, Forest Service, GSA, HUD, and IRS—mainly based on space reduction results and goals. GAO reviewed these agencies' property disposal data for 2012 through 2016 and interviewed headquarters and field staff about their property management and disposal processes. The five agencies GAO reviewed—the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Forest Service, General Services Administration (GSA), Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and Internal Revenue Service (IRS)—generally do not have policies or processes for identifying unneeded personal property, such as office furniture, on a proactive basis. Instead, officials from these agencies said they typically identified unneeded property as a result of a “triggering event,” such as an office space reduction. Executive agencies are required by law to continuously review property under their control to identify unneeded personal property and then dispose of it promptly. Without such policies or processes, agencies may not be routinely identifying unneeded property that could be used elsewhere, and efforts to maximize federal personal property use and minimize unnecessary storage costs may not be effective. GSA has issued regulations establishing a government-wide disposal process for unneeded personal property. However, according to GSA officials, the agency lacks the authority to promulgate regulations or formal guidance on management of in-use agency property, and there is no government-wide guidance to agencies on identifying unneeded personal property. Agencies are required to have internal control activities—such as policies and procedures—for reasonable assurance of efficient operations and minimal resource waste, and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provides guidance to agencies on implementing such activities. Guidance from OMB that emphasizes agencies' internal control responsibilities could help ensure that agencies are proactively and regularly identifying property that is no longer needed. The selected agencies reported little difficulty in following GSA's personal property disposal process, reporting over 37,000 items as unneeded property in fiscal years 2012 through 2016. This property was disposed of through transfers to other agencies, donations to authorized recipients, sales, or discarding. When disposing of personal property from space reduction projects at locations GAO visited, agencies also reported using GSA's process (see figure). Overall, agencies said they have not experienced major challenges with disposing of personal property from space reduction efforts. This lack of challenges could be because projects are geographically dispersed and spread over several years. OMB should provide guidance to executive agencies on managing their personal property, emphasizing that agencies' policies or processes should reflect the requirement to continuously review and identify unneeded personal property.

Additionally, he highlighted the importance of collaboration with the sector and the need for ongoing dialogue to ensure the scheme's success. Huw Irranca-Davies maintained that the scheme was not solely focused on 30 hours of childcare but also included educational elements, and that it was part of a broader strategy to support disadvantaged families and improve child development. He also mentioned the potential for integrating the Welsh Government's offer with the UK Government's tax-free childcare scheme, although he acknowledged that this might not be feasible within the current budget constraints. Overall, while acknowledging the challenges, Huw Irranca-Davies expressed confidence in the scheme's ability to support working parents and improve child development, particularly for disadvantaged families. Key evidence presented included the positive feedback from parents and the need for a universal rate to maintain simplicity and affordability. Unique points included the emphasis on collaboration with the sector and the inclusion of educational elements within the childcare offer.

{"pred": " \n\nThe Holman rule, established in 1835, distinguishes between authorization and appropriations, requiring that general legislation not be included in appropriation bills unless it reduces expenditures. Over time, the rule has been refined to allow retrenchments that reduce the number and salary of federal officials, compensation of persons paid from the Treasury, or the amounts of money covered in an appropriation bill. In the 115th Congress, a separate order was adopted to broaden the scope of the Holman rule, allowing for reductions in the number and salary of officers and compensation of individuals paid from the Treasury. However, the rule still requires that any amendments be germane to the bill and cannot expand its scope. The rule is intended to limit legislative provisions in appropriation bills to those that directly reduce expenditures, and it has been interpreted to exclude broad legislative provisions that would apply to funds in other appropriation bills. The Holman rule has been applied through precedents that have incrementally narrowed its application, and the rule is enforced by the House Parliamentarian. The rule is designed to maintain the separation of policy and funding, ensuring that appropriation bills focus solely on funding and not on broader legislative initiatives. Key evidence includes precedents and interpretations of the rule over time, and unique points include the specific language of the separate order in the 115th Congress and the requirement for germaneness. The rule has been a cornerstone of congressional procedure for over 180 years, shaping the way appropriation bills are considered and passed. The rule's evolution reflects the ongoing tension between the need for efficient budgeting and the desire for comprehensive policy-making.

The agencies' methodologies were found to fall short in several areas, including not fully considering all undesirable events, not assessing all three factors of risk (threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences), and lacking documentation of deviations from the standard. The report highlights that without updated policies and procedures, agencies may struggle to make informed resource allocation decisions and ensure appropriate levels of protection. Additionally, the agencies faced challenges in conducting timely assessments and monitoring the status of countermeasures, particularly due to resource constraints and competing priorities. Recommendations were made for each agency to update their methodologies, policies, and procedures to better align with the ISC standard and improve their physical security programs. The agencies generally agreed with the findings and recommendations, with some providing detailed plans for implementation. The report underscores the importance of comprehensive risk management processes in safeguarding federal facilities. Key evidence includes the agencies' current methodologies and policies, as well as interviews with agency officials and observations of facility assessments. Unique points include the emphasis on the need for data collection and analysis to monitor the performance of physical security programs and the challenges posed by resource limitations and competing priorities.

Most federal agencies are generally responsible for their facilities and have physical security programs to do so. GAO was asked to examine how federal agencies assess facilities' security risks. This report examines: (1) how selected agencies' assessment methodologies align with the ISC's risk management standard for identifying necessary countermeasures and (2) what management challenges, if any, selected agencies reported facing in conducting physical security assessments and monitoring the results. GAO selected four agencies—CBP, FAA, ARS, and the Forest Service—based on their large number of facilities and compared each agency's assessment methodology to the ISC Standard; analyzed facility assessment schedules and results from 2010 through 2016; and interviewed security officials. GAO also visited 13 facilities from these four agencies, selected based on geographical dispersion and their high risk level. None of the four agencies GAO reviewed—U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), and the Forest Service—used security assessment methodologies that fully aligned with the Interagency Security Committee's Risk Management Process for Federal Facilities standard (the ISC Standard). This standard requires that methodologies used to identify necessary facility countermeasures—such as fences and closed-circuit televisions—must: 1. Consider all of the undesirable events (i.e., arson and vandalism) identified by the ISC Standard as possible risks to facilities. 2. Assess three factors—threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences—for each of these events and use these three factors to measure risk. All four agencies used methodologies that included some ISC requirements when conducting assessments. CBP and FAA assessed vulnerabilities but not threats and consequences. ARS and the Forest Service assessed threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences, but did not use these factors to measure risk. In addition, the agencies considered many, but not all 33 undesirable events related to physical security as possible risks to their facilities. Agencies are taking steps to improve their methodologies. For example, ARS and the Forest Service now use a methodology that measures risk and plan to incorporate the methodology into policy. Although CBP and FAA have updated their methodologies, their policies do not require methodologies that fully align with the ISC standard. As a result, these agencies miss the opportunity for a more informed assessment of the risk to their facilities. All four agencies reported facing management challenges in conducting physical security assessments or monitoring assessment results. Specifically, CBP, ARS, and the Forest Service have not met the ISC's required time frame of every 3 years for conducting assessments. For example, security specialists have not conducted required reassessments of two ARS and one Forest Service higher-level facilities. While these three agencies have plans to address backlogs, CBP's plan does not balance conducting risk assessments with other competing security priorities, such as updating its policy manual, and ARS and the Forest Service lack a means to monitor completion of future assessments. Furthermore, CBP, ARS, and the Forest Service did not have the data or information systems to monitor assessment schedules or the status of countermeasures at facilities, and their policies did not specify such data requirements. For example, ARS and the Forest Service do not collect and analyze security-related data, such as countermeasures' implementation. FAA does not routinely monitor the performance of its physical security program. Without improved monitoring, agencies are not well equipped to prioritize their highest security needs, may leave facilities' vulnerabilities unaddressed, and may not take corrective actions to meet physical security program objectives. This is a public version of a sensitive report that GAO issued in August 2017. Information that the agencies under review deemed sensitive has been omitted. GAO recommends: (1) that CBP and FAA update policies to require the use of methodologies fully aligned with the ISC Standard; (2) that CBP revise its plan to eliminate the assessments backlog; and (3) that all four agencies improve monitoring of their physical security programs.

Agencies are required to use existing property or obtain excess property from other agencies before purchasing new ones. The GSA has established a process for disposing of excess property, involving four stages: transfer to another agency or eligible recipient, donation, sale, or abandonment/destroying. Agencies must continually survey their property to identify excess, but many do not have systematic processes for this. The report recommends that the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provide guidance to agencies on managing personal property, emphasizing the need to continuously review and identify unneeded property. The report also notes that while agencies have billions of dollars' worth of personal property, they often fail to effectively assess their property for continued need, leading to idle property that could be put to better use elsewhere within the agency or the federal government. Key evidence includes data showing that agencies do not systematically assess their property for continued need and that unneeded property may be put to better use or missed opportunities for cost savings. Unique points include the suggestion that proactive assessment of personal property for continued need can help agencies achieve both effective and efficient operations by ensuring that only needed property is retained and unneeded property is identified and declared excess. The report also highlights the importance of GSA's role in facilitating the disposal process and the need for OMB to provide guidance to ensure agencies are proactively taking steps to evaluate their property for continued need.

By law, each agency is required to follow GSA's disposal process so that an agency's unneeded property can be used by other agencies or certain non-federal entities. Since 2012, agencies have reduced their office and warehouse space due to government-wide initiatives, a reduction that in turn has required agencies to dispose of some affected personal property. GAO was asked to review how federal agencies identify and dispose of unneeded personal property. This report examines (1) how selected agencies assess whether personal property is needed and (2) how these agencies dispose of unneeded property and how, if at all, space reduction efforts have affected disposals. GAO reviewed federal statutes and regulations, and selected five agencies—EPA, Forest Service, GSA, HUD, and IRS—mainly based on space reduction results and goals. GAO reviewed these agencies' property disposal data for 2012 through 2016 and interviewed headquarters and field staff about their property management and disposal processes. The five agencies GAO reviewed—the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Forest Service, General Services Administration (GSA), Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and Internal Revenue Service (IRS)—generally do not have policies or processes for identifying unneeded personal property, such as office furniture, on a proactive basis. Instead, officials from these agencies said they typically identified unneeded property as a result of a “triggering event,” such as an office space reduction. Executive agencies are required by law to continuously review property under their control to identify unneeded personal property and then dispose of it promptly. Without such policies or processes, agencies may not be routinely identifying unneeded property that could be used elsewhere, and efforts to maximize federal personal property use and minimize unnecessary storage costs may not be effective. GSA has issued regulations establishing a government-wide disposal process for unneeded personal property. However, according to GSA officials, the agency lacks the authority to promulgate regulations or formal guidance on management of in-use agency property, and there is no government-wide guidance to agencies on identifying unneeded personal property. Agencies are required to have internal control activities—such as policies and procedures—for reasonable assurance of efficient operations and minimal resource waste, and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provides guidance to agencies on implementing such activities. Guidance from OMB that emphasizes agencies' internal control responsibilities could help ensure that agencies are proactively and regularly identifying property that is no longer needed. The selected agencies reported little difficulty in following GSA's personal property disposal process, reporting over 37,000 items as unneeded property in fiscal years 2012 through 2016. This property was disposed of through transfers to other agencies, donations to authorized recipients, sales, or discarding. When disposing of personal property from space reduction projects at locations GAO visited, agencies also reported using GSA's process (see figure). Overall, agencies said they have not experienced major challenges with disposing of personal property from space reduction efforts. This lack of challenges could be because projects are geographically dispersed and spread over several years.

{"pred": " \n\nThe passage discusses the effects of radiation exposure and the approach taken by federal agencies to protect public health. Higher radiation doses can cause immediate health effects, while low-dose radiation's impacts are harder to detect. Federal agencies, such as NRC, EPA, DOE, and FDA, rely on scientific advisory bodies to set radiation protection requirements and guidance, generally using the linear no-threshold model, which assumes a proportional relationship between radiation exposure and cancer risk. The National Academies' 2006 report supports this model, although uncertainties exist for very low doses. Agencies set dose limits below the National Academies' definition of low dose, aiming to keep radiation exposure as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA). Between 2012 and 2016, federal funding for low-dose radiation research decreased by 48%, with DOE and NIH accounting for most of the reduction. Despite some collaboration on specific projects, there is no overarching mechanism for interagency collaboration to address research priorities in this field. The GAO recommends that the Department of Energy (DOE) lead the development of such a mechanism to enhance coordination and address shared research priorities. The recommendation is based on DOE's historical role in radiation research and its primary responsibility under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. The passage highlights the importance of continued research to reduce uncertainties in predicting cancer risks from low-dose radiation exposure. Key evidence includes funding trends and the linear no-threshold model's reliance on scientific advisory bodies. Innovative points include the emphasis on ALARA principles and the suggestion for interagency collaboration to improve research prioritization.

The Department of Energy (DOE), Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Food and Drug Administration generally used the advice of scientific advisory bodies to develop and apply radiation protection requirements and guidance for workers and the public in the radiation exposure settings that GAO reviewed. These settings were: (1) the operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants; (2) the cleanup of sites with radiological contamination; (3) the use of medical equipment that produces radiation; and (4) accidental or terrorism-related exposure to radiation. Specifically, the agencies relied on the advice of three scientific advisory bodies that supported the use of a model that assumes the risk of cancer increases with every incremental radiation exposure. Accordingly, the agencies have set regulatory dose limits and issued guidance to confine exposure to levels that reduce the risk of cancer, while recognizing that scientific uncertainties occur in estimating cancer risks from low-dose radiation. For example, NRC requires nuclear power plants to consider measures for limiting workers' exposure below NRC's regulatory dose limit, such as by using robots for maintenance work in radiation areas. GAO identified seven federal agencies that funded research on low-dose radiation's health effects. In fiscal years 2012 to 2016, DOE, NRC, EPA, and four other federal agencies obligated about $210 million for such research . Although the agencies have collaborated on individual projects on radiation's health effects, they have not established a collaborative mechanism to set research priorities. GAO's previous work has shown that federal agencies can use such mechanisms to implement interagency collaboration to develop and coordinate sound science policies. In the past, DOE took a leading role in this area because DOE provided stable funding and advocated for greater coordination on research on low-dose radiation's health effects. However, since fiscal year 2012, DOE has phased out funding for one of its main research programs in this area. This has created a void in coordination efforts among federal agencies, and no other agency has stepped forward to fill this void. Because of DOE's prior experience as a leader in this area of research and its research responsibility under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, it could play an important role in helping federal agencies establish a coordinating mechanism for low-dose radiation research.

This funding has been primarily directed towards the Department of Defense (DOD), with smaller amounts allocated to the Department of State and USAID, and the Department of Homeland Security and Coast Guard. The OCO/GWOT designation has allowed for funding to be exempt from certain statutory and procedural budget enforcement mechanisms, such as the Budget Control Act (BCA) caps on discretionary spending. The use of OCO/GWOT funding has evolved over time, with the Obama Administration moving away from supplemental appropriations for war-related activities and using the regular budget and appropriation process to fund operations. The Trump Administration has requested that OCO funding be designated in a manner that would effectively exempt such funding from the BCA limits on discretionary defense spending. The OCO/GWOT designation has been used to fund a wide range of activities, including base-budget requirements and other non-war-related activities, leading to debates about the appropriateness of its use. The report highlights the need for transparency and accountability in the use of OCO/GWOT funding, as well as the potential for Congress to reconsider the use of this designation in light of changing strategic, budgetary, and political needs. Key evidence includes the breakdown of OCO/GWOT funding by agency and functional category, as well as the historical trends in OCO/GWOT funding and troop levels.

Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Congress has appropriated approximately $2 trillion in discretionary budget authority designated as emergency requirements or for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism (OCO/GWOT) in support of the broad U.S. government response to the 9/11 attacks and for other related international affairs activities. This figure amounts to approximately 9.4% of total discretionary spending during this period. Congress has used supplemental appropriation acts or designated funding for emergency requirements or OCO/GWOT—or both—in statute. These funds are not subject to limits on discretionary spending in congressional budget resolutions or to the statutory discretionary spending limits established by the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-125). The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (BBEDCA; P.L. 99-177) allows emergency funding to be excluded from budget control limits. The BCA added the OCO/GWOT designation to the BBEDCA exemption, thereby providing Congress and the President with an alternate way to exclude funding from the BCA spending limits. While there is no overall statutory limit on the amount of emergency or OCO/GWOT spending, both Congress and the President have fundamental roles in determining how much of the spending to provide each fiscal year. Congress must designate any such funding in statute on an account-by-account basis. The President is also required to designate it as such after it is appropriated to be available for expenditure. Debate over what should constitute OCO/GWOT or emergency activities and expenses has shifted over time, reflecting differing viewpoints about the extent, nature, and duration of U.S. military operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere. Funding designated for OCO/GWOT has also been used to fund base-budget requirements of the DOD and State Department and to prevent or respond to crises abroad, including armed conflict, as well as human-caused and natural disasters. Some defense officials and policymakers argue OCO funding allows for flexible response to contingencies, and provides a \"safety valve\" to the spending caps and threat of sequestration—the automatic cancellation of budget authority largely through across-the-board reductions of nonexempt programs and activities—under the BCA. Critics, however, have described OCO/GWOT as a loophole or \"gimmick\"—morphing from an account for replacing combat losses of equipment, resupplying expended munitions, and transporting troops through war zones, to a \"slush fund\" for activities unrelated to contingency operations. Congress appropriated approximately $103 billion for OCO in FY2017 (8.5% of all discretionary appropriations), $78 billion for OCO in FY2018 (5.5% of all discretionary appropriations), and $68.8 billion for OCO so far in FY2019. Discretionary appropriations for FY2019 are not yet final; a continuing resolution expired December 21, 2018. Following passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-123), which raised discretionary budget caps for defense and foreign affairs agencies in FY2018 and FY2019, the Administration proposed shifting some OCO funding into the base, or regular, budget. Although Congress has generally not followed Administration requests for reduced funding for foreign affairs and domestic activities and has increased funding for defense, the President has asked cabinet secretaries to propose spending cuts of 5% in FY2020. Such proposals, if requested in a budget submission, may create difficult choices for Congress in FY2020 and FY2021—the final two years of the BCA discretionary spending limits. Congress's decisions on OCO/GWOT designations will affect how much agency funding is available for military operations and foreign affairs activities overseas, how much is subject to the BCA caps, and how much is incorporated into regular budgets and long-term budget projections."], "length": 26611}
{"pred": " \n\nThe U.S. European Command (EUCOM) is responsible for maintaining a robust defense posture in Europe to support U.S. military objectives and relations with allies and partners. Since the end of the Cold War, the number of U.S. military sites and personnel in Europe has significantly decreased, and two heavy combat brigades have been deactivated. In response to Russia's aggressive actions, the U.S. established the European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) in 2014 to enhance its military presence in Europe. ERI has led to increased force deployments, new infrastructure projects, and host nation agreements to support U.S. activities. However, EUCOM faces challenges in planning and funding these initiatives, as it uses a separate process outside of its established posture planning and budgeting procedures. This approach has led to a lack of prioritization, incomplete cost estimates, and limited visibility into future costs for Congress. The report recommends that the Secretary of Defense prioritize ERI initiatives relative to other posture initiatives, develop comprehensive cost estimates, and provide Congress with future cost projections. Additionally, the report suggests that EUCOM and the military services should use the established processes to plan and budget for ERI initiatives to ensure strategic alignment and sustainability. Key evidence includes the ERI's objectives, funding requests, and the lack of prioritization and cost estimates in the current planning process. Unique points highlight the need for improved strategic planning and transparency in ERI's implementation. The report also emphasizes the importance of aligning ERI with broader defense strategies and ensuring that initiatives are sustainable over the long term. The U.S. Constitution outlines the compensation structure for Members of Congress, including the requirement for compensation to be set by law and paid out of the Treasury. Since 1992, Member salaries have been adjusted annually based on changes in the Employment Cost Index (ECI), with adjustments being denied or limited by other factors such as the General Schedule (GS) base pay adjustment. The report provides historical data on Member pay adjustments and discusses various legislative efforts to reform the pay adjustment process. It highlights the challenges of balancing the need for competitive pay with fiscal constraints and the desire for greater transparency and accountability in the pay-setting process. The report concludes that while the current system has flaws, it remains the most practical approach given the constitutional constraints and the need for flexibility in adjusting pay. Key evidence includes the historical data on pay adjustments, the legislative history of attempts to reform the system, and the constitutional provisions governing compensation. Unique points include the tension between maintaining competitive pay", "answers": ["In response to Russia's annexation of Crimea in March 2014, the President announced the ERI, to reassure allies in Europe of U.S. commitment to their security. This initiative has been funded using OCO appropriations, which Congress provides in addition to DOD's base budget appropriations. The Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying the Continuing Appropriations and Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017, included a provision for GAO to review matters related to ERI. In this report, we (1) describe changes in ERI's objectives, funding under ERI, and DOD's posture in Europe since 2014 and (2) evaluate the extent to which DOD's planning processes for posture initiatives funded under ERI prioritize those initiatives, estimate their long-term costs, and communicate their estimated costs to Congress. GAO analyzed DOD strategy documentation, budget and cost analysis guidance, budget justification materials, and cost and obligations data. GAO also interviewed knowledgeable officials within the Office of the Secretary of Defense, U.S. European Command, the military services, and the State Department. Since 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) has expanded the European Reassurance Initiative's (ERI) objectives, increased its funding, and planned enhancements to European posture. DOD expanded ERI's objectives from the short-term reassurance of allies and partners to include deterring Russian aggression in the long term and developing the capacity to field a credible combined force should deterrence fail. With respect to funding, DOD will have requested approximately $4.5 billion for ERI's posture enhancements through the end of fiscal year 2017 (about $3.2 billion for fiscal year 2017 alone), and in July 2016 EUCOM identified funding needs for future posture initiatives. The expansion of ERI's objectives has contributed to DOD's enhancing its posture in Europe. Specifically, DOD has increased the size and duration of Army combat unit deployments, planned to preposition Army equipment in Eastern Europe, added new enduring locations (e.g., locations that DOD expects to access and use to support U.S. security interests for the foreseeable future), improved infrastructure, and negotiated new agreements with European nations. As of April 2017, DOD was considering further force enhancements under ERI as part of the department's ERI budget request. DOD also was reviewing whether new enduring locations to support ERI were needed and was considering other improvements to existing infrastructure. DOD's process for planning ERI has not established priorities among posture initiatives funded under ERI relative to those in its base budget, nor estimated long-term sustainment costs for some posture initiatives funded under ERI, nor communicated future costs to Congress. ERI is being planned using a separate process from DOD's established processes and is funded from DOD's overseas contingency operations (OCO) appropriations. GAO found several weaknesses: Lack of prioritization : DOD establishes priorities among ERI posture initiatives but has not evaluated them against base budget initiatives using its posture management process. As a result, DOD lacks an understanding of the relative importance of ERI initiatives and may be investing in projects that it will not continue should OCO funding become unavailable. Lack of sustainment costs : EUCOM and the military services have not fully estimated the long-term costs to sustain equipment and construction funded under ERI. Based on DOD's approach for calculating rough order sustainment costs, GAO determined that these costs could be substantial. DOD officials said that GAO correctly applied DOD's approach for estimating sustainment costs, but noted that actual costs may be lower, because the military services may not fully fund sustainment. In the absence of comprehensive estimates, DOD has been limited in its ability to assess affordability and plan for future costs. Not communicating future costs : DOD limits Congress's visibility into the resources needed to implement ERI and achieve its objectives because it does not include future costs in its ERI budget request. This is a public version of a classified report issued in August 2017. Information on specific posture planning, guidance, and budget estimates that DOD deemed to be classified have been omitted from this report. GAO recommends that DOD prioritize ERI posture initiatives against initiatives in its base budget, develop cost estimates for sustaining initiatives, and communicate future costs to Congress. DOD partially concurred with GAO's recommendations. GAO continues to believe that these recommendations are warranted."], "length": 27216}
{"pred": " \n\nThe Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) establishes minimum wage and overtime pay requirements for most private and public sector employees. The FLSA includes an exemption for executive, administrative, and professional employees (EAP) from both minimum wage and overtime pay requirements. To qualify for the EAP exemption, an employee must meet three criteria: be paid on a salary basis, perform executive, administrative, or professional duties, and earn above a certain salary threshold. The salary threshold for the EAP exemption has been raised nine times since the FLSA was enacted in 1938. The 2019 proposed rule would increase the salary level test from the current $455 per week to $679 per week, and the annual salary threshold for the Highly Compensated Employee (HCE) exemption from $100,000 to $147,414. The proposed rule would also allow up to 10% of the standard salary level to be comprised of nondiscretionary bonuses, incentive payments, and commissions. The 2019 proposed rule aims to update the EAP salary level thresholds every four years. Approximately 4.9 million workers would be affected by the proposed rule, with about 1.3 million EAP employees becoming newly entitled to overtime pay and an additional 3.6 million workers receiving strengthened overtime protections. The proposed rule would expand overtime coverage to EAP employees through a higher salary level threshold rather than through additional classes of employees.

TANF was created in the 1996 welfare reform law (P.L. 104-193). This report responds to some frequently asked questions about TANF; it does not describe TANF rules (see, instead, CRS Report RL32748, The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Block Grant: A Primer on TANF Financing and Federal Requirements, by Gene Falk). TANF Funding and Expenditures. TANF provides fixed funding for the 50 states, the District of Columbia, the territories, and American Indian tribes. The basic block grant totals $16.5 billion per year. States are also required in total to contribute, from their own funds, at least $10.3 billion annually under a maintenance-of-effort (MOE) requirement. Though TANF is best known for funding cash assistance payments for needy families with children, the block grant and MOE funds are used for a wide variety of benefits and activities. In FY2017, expenditures on basic assistance totaled $7.1 billion—23% of total federal TANF and MOE dollars. Basic assistance is often—but not exclusively—paid as cash. In addition to funding basic assistance, TANF also contributes funds for child care and services for children who have been, or are at risk of being, abused and neglected. Some states also count expenditures in prekindergarten programs toward the MOE requirement. The TANF Assistance Caseload. A total of 1.2 million families, composed of 3.1 million recipients, received TANF- or MOE-funded assistance in September 2018. The bulk of the \"recipients\" were children—2.3 million in that month. The assistance caseload is heterogeneous. The type of family once thought of as the \"typical\" assistance family—one with an unemployed adult recipient—accounted for 32% of all families on the rolls in FY2016. Additionally, 31% of cash assistance families had an employed adult, while 38% of all TANF families were \"child-only\" and had no adult recipient. Child-only families include those with disabled adults receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI), adults who are nonparents (e.g., grandparents, aunts, uncles) caring for children, and families consisting of citizen children and ineligible noncitizen parents. Cash Assistance Benefits. TANF cash benefit amounts are set by states. In July 2017, the maximum monthly benefit for a family of three ranged from $1,021 in New Hampshire to $170 in Mississippi. Only New Hampshire (at 60% of the federal poverty guidelines) had a maximum TANF cash assistance amount for this sized family in excess of 50% of poverty-level income. Work Requirements. TANF's main federal work requirement is actually a performance measure that applies to the states. States determine the work rules that apply to individual recipients. TANF law requires states to engage 50% of all families and 90% of two-parent families with work-eligible individuals in work activities, though these standards can be reduced by \"credits.\" Therefore, the effective standards states face are often less than the 50% or 90% targets, and vary by state. In FY2017, states achieved, on average, an all-family participation rate of 53.0% and a two-parent rate of 69.5%. In FY2017, two jurisdictions did not meet the all-family participation standard: Nevada and Guam. This is a reduction from FY2012, when 16 states did not meet that standard. In FY2017, nine jurisdictions did not meet the two-parent standard. States that do not meet work standards are at risk of being penalized by a reduction in their block grant."], "length": 27478}

{"pred": " \n\nThe Federal Housing Administration (FHA) was established in 1934 to encourage lending for housing and stimulate the construction industry during the Great Depression. It insures private mortgage lenders against borrower default, facilitating access to affordable mortgages for some households who might otherwise struggle to obtain them. FHA plays a countercyclical role, insuring more mortgages during economic downturns. Key features of FHA-insured mortgages include lower down payment requirements, less stringent credit history requirements, and a focus on first-time homebuyers, low- and moderate-income households, and minorities. FHA-insured mortgages have a maximum mortgage amount set by law, which varies by area and property type. FHA also charges mortgage insurance premiums to cover potential losses. Loss mitigation strategies are available to help borrowers avoid foreclosure. The FHA insurance fund is funded through premiums and proceeds from the sale of foreclosed homes, and its financial status is monitored to ensure it can cover future claims. The market share of FHA-insured mortgages has fluctuated, peaking during economic downturns and declining as mortgage markets recover. The passage highlights the role of FHA in providing affordable housing and its importance during economic downturns. Key evidence includes historical data on FHA's market share and the unique feature of its countercyclical role. Innovative points include the detailed explanation of FHA's underwriting criteria and the loss mitigation strategies available to borrowers. The passage also notes the importance of the FHA insurance fund's financial health and the need for ongoing monitoring to ensure its sustainability. The summary focuses on the main arguments and key evidence presented in the passage, highlighting the unique aspects of FHA's role and operations. It emphasizes the importance of FHA in providing affordable housing and its countercyclical function during economic downturns. The supporting data on market share and the detailed explanation of underwriting criteria and loss mitigation strategies are included to provide context and depth. The passage also underscores the need for ongoing financial monitoring of the FHA insurance fund to ensure its sustainability. The summary concludes by noting the fluctuating market share of FHA-insured mortgages and the broader debate about the appropriate market share for FHA in the U.S. housing finance system. This comprehensive overview captures the essence of the passage while staying within the constraints of a concise summary. \n\n---\n\nSummary of Passage 2:\n\nThis passage discusses the importance of cross-border data flows for global trade and commerce, highlighting their economic benefits and the challenges posed by privacy and security concerns. Key points include the economic impact of data flows, the role of international agreements in addressing privacy, and the divergent approaches", "answers": ["The Federal Housing Administration (FHA), an agency of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), was created by the National Housing Act of 1934. FHA insures private lenders against the possibility of borrowers defaulting on mortgages that meet certain criteria, thereby expanding the availability of mortgage credit beyond what may be available otherwise. If the borrower defaults on the mortgage, FHA is to repay the lender the remaining amount owed. A household that obtains an FHA-insured mortgage must meet FHA's eligibility and underwriting standards, including showing that it has sufficient income to repay a mortgage. FHA requires a minimum down payment of 3.5% from most borrowers, which is lower than the down payment required for many other types of mortgages. FHA-insured mortgages cannot exceed a statutory maximum mortgage amount, which varies by area and is based on area median house prices but cannot exceed a specified ceiling in high-cost areas. (The ceiling is set at $726,525 in high-cost areas in calendar year 2019.) Borrowers are charged fees, called mortgage insurance premiums, in exchange for the insurance. In FY2018, FHA insured over 1 million new mortgages (including both home purchase and refinance mortgages) with a combined principal balance of $209 billion. FHA's share of the mortgage market tends to vary with economic conditions and other factors. In the aftermath of the housing market turmoil that began around 2007 and a related contraction of mortgage lending, FHA insured a larger share of mortgages than it had in the preceding years. Its overall share of the mortgage market increased from about 3% in calendar year 2005 to a peak of 21% in 2009. Since that time, FHA's share of the mortgage market has decreased somewhat, though it remains higher than it was in the early 2000s. In calendar year 2017, FHA's overall share of the mortgage market was about 17%. FHA-insured mortgages, like all mortgages, experienced increased default rates during the housing downturn that began around 2007, leading to concerns about the stability of the FHA insurance fund for single-family mortgages, the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMI Fund). In response to these concerns, FHA adopted a number of policy changes in an attempt to limit risk to the MMI Fund. These changes have included raising the fees that it charges and making changes to certain eligibility criteria for FHA-insured loans."], "length": 25248}
{"pred": " \n\nThe Commercial Space Launch Act Amendments of 1988 established federal indemnification for third-party damages resulting from commercial launch or reentry accidents, aiming to create a competitive environment for the U.S. commercial space launch industry. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) determines the Maximum Liability Payment (MPL) for each launch, which is intended to cover potential damages to third parties and the federal government. Since 2012, FAA has revised its MPL methodology, but has not fully addressed certain requirements of the Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act (CSLCA). Specifically, FAA has not re-evaluated the probability thresholds, which determine the balance of risk between launch companies and the federal government, and has not evaluated the cost impact of the updated methodology on both the industry and the federal government. Additionally, FAA has not consulted with the commercial space sector and insurance providers as required by CSLCA. These omissions mean FAA cannot ensure that the federal government is not exposed to greater liability costs than intended or that launch companies are not required to purchase more insurance coverage than necessary. Recent changes to the confirmation process for presidential appointees, including the reduction of post-cloture time for nominations, have affected the balance of power between the Senate and the executive branch. The confirmation process for executive branch positions and judges is regulated by Senate rules and precedents, with nominations typically referred to relevant committees for review. Committees gather information on nominees through various means, including FBI reports and financial disclosure forms. Hearings are held for some nominations, and the Senate votes to confirm or reject nominees. The confirmation process can be influenced by political considerations and may be delayed or blocked by minority party senators. The recent reinterpretation of the cloture rule has shortened the time between a cloture vote and a confirmation vote, potentially reducing the influence of the Senate in the confirmation process. FAA's MPL methodology for determining the amount of insurance coverage required for commercial launches has been revised, but key elements remain unchanged, leading to concerns about the balance of risk between launch companies and the federal government. The confirmation process for presidential appointees has evolved, with recent changes aimed at streamlining the process and reducing the influence of the Senate. FAA's MPL methodology and the confirmation process for presidential appointees both highlight the ongoing challenges in balancing the interests of the federal government and the private sector in the commercial space industry and in the broader context of presidential appointments. The FAA's MPL methodology and the confirmation process for presidential appointees both face challenges in ensuring a fair balance of risk and influence. FAA", "answers": ["The federal government shares liability risks with the commercial space launch industry for accidents that result in damages to third parties or federal property. This arrangement requires space launch companies to have a specific amount of insurance to cover these damages. The government is potentially liable for damages above that amount, up to a cap GAO estimated to be $3.1 billion in 2017, subject to appropriations in advance. CSLCA, enacted in 2015, directed the Department of Transportation, of which FAA is a part, to evaluate its MPL methodology and, if necessary, develop a plan to update that methodology. The act also included a provision requiring GAO to assess FAA's evaluation and any actions needed to update the methodology. This report discusses the extent to which (1) FAA's evaluation report addresses the requirements in CSLCA and (2) FAA has addressed previously identified weaknesses in the MPL methodology. GAO reviewed documents and interviewed FAA on its loss methodology evaluation and actions to address weaknesses. The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) report evaluating its maximum probable loss (MPL) methodology did not fully address the evaluation and consultation requirements specified by the U.S. Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act (CSLCA). Balance of Risk. CSLCA required FAA to include ensuring that the federal government is not exposed to greater indemnification costs and that launch companies are not required to purchase more insurance coverage than necessary as a result of FAA's MPL methodology. FAA said that it ensured this balance by improving its methodology, but it did not reevaluate its probability thresholds after revising its methodology. These thresholds are used to divide the risk of loss between launch companies and the government. Impact on Costs. The act required FAA to consider the costs to both the industry and the federal government of implementing an updated methodology. FAA's report discussed the impact on indirect costs, such as data collection, but did not discuss direct costs: insurance premiums for launch companies and indemnification liability for the federal government. Consultation. The act also required FAA to consult with the commercial space sector and insurance providers in evaluating its MPL methodology in accordance with the preceding requirements. While the agency consulted with some stakeholders, these consultations were limited in scope. FAA officials said they have not been able to take the actions needed to fully satisfy the mandated elements because of issues such as resource limitations and the lack of available data. However, by not resolving these issues, FAA lacks assurance that launch companies are not purchasing more insurance than needed or that the federal government is not being exposed to greater indemnification costs than expected. FAA has addressed two of three previously identified weaknesses in its MPL methodology but has not yet dealt with the remaining weakness. Specifically, the agency has revised its methodology for estimating the number of potential casualties for a launch and changed the factor it uses to derive estimated property damage from estimated casualties. However, FAA has not updated the amount used for the cost of an individual casualty. GAO recommended in a March 2017 report (GAO-17-366) that FAA update this amount. Not doing so could understate the amount of insurance launch companies are required to purchase, exposing the federal government to excess risk. GAO also determined that while FAA has two tools and methods it can use in making its MPL estimates, it does not have guidance on determining which are most appropriate for a given launch scenario. For example, one tool is more comprehensive but also labor intensive to use, while the other is inappropriate for certain launch scenarios and could result in misleading MPL amounts. Officials said they have begun to create such guidance but do not have an estimated completion date. Without such guidance, FAA cannot ensure that the most appropriate MPL methodology is used for each launch. FAA should fully address mandated requirements in evaluating its MPL—probability thresholds, direct costs, and stakeholder consultations— and establish an estimated completion date for developing guidance on tools and methods to use for specific launch scenarios. The Department of Transportation concurred with the recommendations, and provided technical comments."], "length": 27200}

Unique points include the expansion of services to address the needs of specific populations and the ongoing efforts to improve data collection and evaluation methods to better understand and address youth homelessness. The program has evolved to include a broader range of services and support systems for youth experiencing homelessness, reflecting a growing recognition of the complex issues surrounding youth homelessness and the need for comprehensive solutions. The Runaway and Homeless Youth Program, established by the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act of 1974, aims to assist youth who have run away or are homeless through three main components: the Basic Center Program (BCP), Transitional Living Program (TLP), and Street Outreach Program (SOP). BCP provides short-term shelter and services for youth and their families, TLP offers longer-term support for youth aged 16-22, and SOP focuses on outreach and education for youth living on the streets. Since its inception, the program has seen increased funding and has expanded to include services for specific populations, such as LGBTQ youth and those with child welfare involvement. Key evidence includes the number of youth served by each program component and the outcomes of the Voices of Youth Count study, which highlights the challenges faced by homeless youth, such as mental health disorders, substance abuse, and sexual exploitation.", "answers": ["This report discusses runaway and homeless youth, and the federal response to support this population. There is no single definition of the terms \"runaway youth\" or \"homeless youth.\" However, both groups of youth share the risk of not having adequate shelter and other provisions, and may engage in harmful behaviors while away from a permanent home. Youth most often cite family conflict as the major reason for their homelessness or episodes of running away. A youth's sexual orientation, sexual activity, school problems, and substance abuse are associated with family discord. The precise number of homeless and runaway youth is unknown due to their residential mobility and overlap among the populations. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is supporting data collection efforts, known as Voices of Youth Count, to better determine the number of homeless youth. The 2017 study found that approximately 700,000 youth ages 13 to 17 and 3.5 million young adults ages 18 to 25 experienced homelessness within a 12-month period because they were sleeping in places not meant for habitation, in shelters, or with others while lacking alternative living arrangements. From the early 20th century through the 1960s, the needs of runaway and homeless youth were handled locally through the child welfare agency, juvenile justice courts, or both. The 1970s marked a shift toward federal oversight of programs that help youth who had run afoul of the law, including those who committed status offenses (i.e., a noncriminal act that is considered a violation of the law because of the youth's age). The Runaway Youth Act of 1974 was enacted as Title III of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (P.L. 93-415) to assist runaways through services specifically for this population. The act was amended over time to include homeless youth. It authorizes funding for services carried out under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Program (RHYP), which is administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The program was most recently authorized through FY2020 by the Juvenile Justice Reform Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-385). This law did not make other changes to the RHYP statute. Funding is discretionary, meaning provided through the appropriations process. FY2019 appropriations are $127.4 million. The RHYP program is made up of three components: the Basic Center Program (BCP), Transitional Living Program (TLP), and Street Outreach Program (SOP). The BCP provides temporary shelter, counseling, and after care services to runaway and homeless youth under age 18 and their families. In FY2017, the program served 23,288 youth, and in FY2018 it funded 280 BCP shelters (most recent figures available). The TLP is targeted to older youth ages 16 through 22 (and sometimes an older age). In FY2017, the TLP program served 3,517 youth, and in FY2018 it funded 299 grantees (most recent figures available). Youth who use the TLP receive longer-term housing with supportive services. The SOP provides education, treatment, counseling, and referrals for runaway, homeless, and street youth who have been subjected to, or are at risk of being subjected to, sexual abuse, sex exploitation, and trafficking. In FY2017, the SOP grantees made contact with 24,366 youth. The RHYP is a part of larger federal efforts to end youth homelessness through the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH). The USICH is a coordinating body made up of multiple federal agencies committed to addressing homelessness. The USICH's Opening Doors plan to end homelessness includes strategies for ending youth homelessness by 2020, including through collecting better data and supporting evidence-based practices to improve youth outcomes. Voices of Youth Count is continuing to report on characteristics of homeless youth. In addition to the RHYP, there are other federal supports to address youth homelessness. HUD's Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program is funding a range of housing options for youth, in selected urban and rural communities. Other federal programs have enabled homeless youth to access services, including those related to education and family violence."], "length": 26883}

Additionally, the VA medical centers did not always conduct reviews of providers' clinical care in a timely manner, with 16 providers not initiating reviews for 3 months to multiple years after concerns were raised. The VA's inadequate documentation and untimely reviews of providers' clinical care are due to a lack of VHA policy requiring documentation of all types of reviews and a lack of VHA oversight to ensure timely reviews. The VA also failed to report nine providers to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) and state licensing boards as required, despite these providers having significant clinical deficiencies. The VA medical centers did not report these providers due to a lack of understanding of VHA policies and a lack of VHA oversight to ensure timely reporting. The VA's failure to report providers to the NPDB and state licensing boards facilitates providers who provide substandard care at one facility obtaining privileges at another VA medical center or at hospitals outside of VA's health care system. The VA should require documentation of all reviews of providers' clinical care, establish timeliness requirements for initiating such reviews, and strengthen oversight by requiring networks to oversee VA medical centers to ensure that such reviews are documented and initiated in a timely manner.

Originating in 1835, the rule evolved to allow retrenchments that reduce the number and salary of federal officials, compensation of persons paid from the Treasury, or the amounts of money covered in an appropriation bill. In 1983, the rule was restructured to limit retrenchments to reductions in funds covered by the bill. The 115th Congress reinstated the Holman rule with a separate order, allowing amendments that reduce the number and salary of officers, or the compensation of any person paid from the Treasury. However, the rule remains subject to the requirement that any reduction must be a necessary result of the legislation and not contingent on an event.

Since the period immediately after its initial adoption, the House has interpreted the Holman rule through precedents that have tended to incrementally narrow its application. Under current precedents, for a legislative provision or amendment to be in order, the legislative language in question must be both germane to other provisions in the measure and must produce a clear reduction of appropriations in that bill.

Between fiscal year 2008 and 2018, attack submarines incurred 10,363 days of idle time and maintenance delays, primarily due to depot maintenance delays. The SUBSAFE program, which ensures submarine safety, requires strict adherence to maintenance schedules, leading to delays and idle time when submarines cannot meet these requirements. The Navy has faced persistent workforce shortages and facility issues at public shipyards, exacerbating these delays. Despite efforts to address these challenges, such as hiring more personnel and planning capital investments, the maintenance backlogs continue to grow. The report recommends that the Navy conduct a comprehensive business case analysis to inform the allocation of maintenance periods between public and private shipyards, incorporating a full accounting of costs, benefits, and risks. This would help the Navy better leverage private shipyard capacity and reduce idle time and maintenance delays, thereby maximizing the readiness and operational effectiveness of the attack submarine fleet. Key evidence includes maintenance delay data, operating and support cost estimates, and interviews with Navy and shipyard officials. Unique points include the recommendation for a business case analysis and the acknowledgment that private shipyards could provide additional availability to combatant commanders while mitigating costs. The report also highlights the importance of the attack submarine fleet in providing critical capabilities for intelligence gathering, target attacks, and special forces insertion. The Navy's failure to address maintenance challenges adequately risks the full utilization of its investment in attack submarines and the potential for increased costs due to idle time and maintenance delays. The Secretary of the Navy should ensure that the Chief of Naval Operations conducts this analysis to optimize maintenance workload allocation and improve submarine readiness.

GAO's analysis of Navy maintenance data shows that between fiscal year 2008 and 2018, attack submarines have incurred 10,363 days of idle time and maintenance delays as a result of delays in getting into and out of the shipyards. For example, the Navy originally scheduled the USS Boise to enter a shipyard for an extended maintenance period in 2013 but, due to heavy shipyard workload, the Navy delayed the start of the maintenance period. In June 2016, the USS Boise could no longer conduct normal operations and the boat has remained idle, pierside for over two years since then waiting to enter a shipyard (see figure). GAO estimated that since fiscal year 2008 the Navy has spent more than $1.5 billion in fiscal year 2018 constant dollars to support attack submarines that provide no operational capability—those sitting idle while waiting to enter the shipyards, and those delayed in completing their maintenance at the shipyards. The Navy has started to address challenges related to workforce shortages and facilities needs at the public shipyards. However, it has not effectively allocated maintenance periods among public shipyards and private shipyards that may also be available to help minimize attack submarine idle time. GAO's analysis found that while the public shipyards have operated above capacity for the past several years, attack submarine maintenance delays are getting longer and idle time is increasing. The Navy may have options to mitigate this idle time and maintenance delays by leveraging private shipyard capacity for repair work. But the Navy has not completed a comprehensive business case analysis as recommended by Department of Defense guidelines to inform maintenance workload allocation across public and private shipyards. Navy leadership has acknowledged that they need to be more proactive in leveraging potential private shipyard repair capacity. Without addressing this challenge, the Navy risks continued expenditure of operating and support funding to crew, maintain, and support attack submarines that provide no operational capability because they are delayed in getting into and out of maintenance. GAO recommends that the Navy conduct a business case analysis to inform maintenance workload allocation across public and private shipyards. The Department of Defense concurred with GAO's recommendation."], "length": 26137}
{"pred": " \n\nPassage 2 discusses the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), an agency of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) that insures private mortgage lenders against borrower default. Established in 1934 during the Great Depression, FHA's primary goal is to facilitate affordable housing by providing insurance for long-term mortgages. The report outlines the eligibility criteria for FHA-insured mortgages, including lower down payment requirements and less stringent credit history requirements, which make it easier for first-time homebuyers, low- and moderate-income households, and minorities to obtain mortgages. FHA-insured mortgages play a significant role in the housing market, particularly during economic downturns, and have experienced fluctuations in market share over time. The report also highlights the financial aspects of FHA's operations, including the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund, which is funded through insurance premiums and proceeds from the sale of foreclosed homes, and the fund's compliance with a statutory capital ratio requirement. Additionally, the passage provides data on the number and dollar volume of FHA-insured mortgages, as well as the fund's financial status. The key evidence includes statistics on the number of FHA-insured mortgages, the market share of FHA in recent years, and the financial performance of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund. Innovative points include the countercyclical role of FHA in the mortgage market and the unique down payment and credit requirements for FHA-insured mortgages. The main argument is that FHA plays a crucial role in providing affordable housing and stabilizing the mortgage market during economic downturns. The report emphasizes the importance of maintaining the FHA program to ensure access to affordable mortgages for certain segments of the population. The passage also highlights the need for ongoing evaluation of the program's financial sustainability and its role in the broader housing finance system. The unique aspect of the report is its comprehensive overview of FHA's historical context, eligibility criteria, and financial operations, providing a clear picture of the program's significance in the U.S. housing market. The report concludes by noting the importance of continued monitoring and adjustment of the program to meet evolving economic and housing market conditions. The summary focuses on the key points of the passage, including the role of FHA in facilitating affordable housing, the eligibility criteria for FHA-insured mortgages, the countercyclical nature of the program, and the financial aspects of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund.

FHA insures private lenders against the possibility of borrowers defaulting on mortgages that meet certain criteria, thereby expanding the availability of mortgage credit beyond what may be available otherwise. If the borrower defaults on the mortgage, FHA is to repay the lender the remaining amount owed. A household that obtains an FHA-insured mortgage must meet FHA's eligibility and underwriting standards, including showing that it has sufficient income to repay a mortgage. FHA requires a minimum down payment of 3.5% from most borrowers, which is lower than the down payment required for many other types of mortgages. FHA-insured mortgages cannot exceed a statutory maximum mortgage amount, which varies by area and is based on area median house prices but cannot exceed a specified ceiling in high-cost areas. (The ceiling is set at $726,525 in high-cost areas in calendar year 2019.) Borrowers are charged fees, called mortgage insurance premiums, in exchange for the insurance. In FY2018, FHA insured over 1 million new mortgages (including both home purchase and refinance mortgages) with a combined principal balance of $209 billion. FHA's share of the mortgage market tends to vary with economic conditions and other factors. In the aftermath of the housing market turmoil that began around 2007 and a related contraction of mortgage lending, FHA insured a larger share of mortgages than it had in the preceding years. Its overall share of the mortgage market increased from about 3% in calendar year 2005 to a peak of 21% in 2009. Since that time, FHA's share of the mortgage market has decreased somewhat, though it remains higher than it was in the early 2000s. In calendar year 2017, FHA's overall share of the mortgage market was about 17%. FHA-insured mortgages, like all mortgages, experienced increased default rates during the housing downturn that began around 2007, leading to concerns about the stability of the FHA insurance fund for single-family mortgages, the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMI Fund). In response to these concerns, FHA adopted a number of policy changes in an attempt to limit risk to the MMI Fund. These changes have included raising the fees that it charges and making changes to certain eligibility criteria for FHA-insured loans."], "length": 26928}

With a history of strong economic aid and security cooperation, the United States has deepened its strategic partnership with Georgia since Russia's 2008 invasion of Georgia and 2014 invasion of Ukraine. U.S. policy expressly supports Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders, and Georgia is a leading recipient of U.S. aid to Europe and Eurasia. Many observers consider Georgia to be one of the most democratic states in the post-Soviet region, even as the country faces ongoing governance challenges. The center-left Georgian Dream-Democratic Georgia party (GD) has close to a three-fourths supermajority in parliament and governs with limited checks and balances. Although Georgia faces high rates of poverty and underemployment, its economy in 2017 and 2018 appeared to show stronger growth than it had in the previous four years. The GD led a coalition to victory in parliamentary elections in 2012 amid growing dissatisfaction with the former ruling party, Mikheil Saakashvili's center-right United National Movement, which came to power as a result of Georgia's 2003 Rose Revolution. In August 2008, Russia went to war with Georgia to prevent Saakashvili's government from reestablishing control over the regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which broke away from Georgia in the early 1990s and became informal Russian protectorates. Congress has expressed firm support for Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Countering Russian Influence in Europe and Eurasia Act of 2017 (P.L. 115-44, Title II, §253) states that the United States \"does not recognize territorial changes effected by force, including the illegal invasions and occupations\" of Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and other territories occupied by Russia. In September 2016, the House of Representatives passed H.Res. 660, which condemns Russia's military intervention and occupation of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. In February 2019, the Georgia Support Act (H.R. 598), which originally passed the House by unanimous consent in the 115th Congress (H.R. 6219), was reintroduced in the 116th Congress.

These medals are awarded to honor distinguished contributions, express public gratitude, and perpetuate the remembrance of great events. Unlike other awards, there are no permanent statutory provisions specifically relating to the creation of Congressional Gold Medals. Instead, Congress has provided for the creation of personalized medals on an ad hoc basis. The process for considering legislation varies between the House and Senate, with no formal limits on the number of medals that can be authorized in a given year. Recent decades have seen an increase in the number of Congressional Gold Medals awarded, averaging nearly twenty per decade in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. The authorizing legislation for these medals typically includes findings summarizing the subject's history and importance, specifications for the medal's design and striking, and instructions for the medal's presentation and display. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Citizens Coinage Advisory Commission and the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, determines the final design of each medal. While there are no formal restrictions on the number of medals that can be awarded, some Members of Congress have proposed placing a limit on the number of medals issued annually to maintain the prestige of the award.

GAO reviewed documents and funding data from Education, and federal laws and regulations; surveyed all 79 state VR agencies (74 responded); held discussion groups with representatives of 29 state VR agencies; and interviewed officials from Education and three states (Idaho, Illinois, and Maryland) GAO selected for variety in size and type of agencies, among other factors. Of the 74 state vocational rehabilitation (VR) agencies that responded to GAO's survey, most reported expanding services to help students with disabilities transition from school to work as required under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), enacted in July 2014. Most state agencies reported serving more students and providing work-based learning experiences and other activities, referred to as pre-employment transition services (see figure). State VR agencies reported two key challenges with implementing pre-employment transition services for students as required by WIOA. Spending reserved funds : States reported spending about $357 million out of the $465 million reserved for these services in fiscal year 2016. Education officials said that states had difficulty determining what expenditures were allowable, and some state officials said they would like more detailed information from Education. Education officials said they plan to clarify guidance but have no timeframe for providing further information, which would help states to better plan their use of reserved funds. Finalizing interagency agreements : Fewer than half the state VR agencies that responded to GAO's survey (34 of 74) reported updating their interagency agreement with their state's educational agency. Interagency agreements can help promote collaboration by, for example, establishing roles and responsibilities of each agency. Although Education offers technical assistance on interagency agreements, without increased efforts to raise awareness about the importance of these agreements and provide assistance to states where needed, Education may miss opportunities to help state VR and educational agencies efficiently and effectively coordinate services. In addition, WIOA requires Education to highlight best state practices, and most VR agencies responding to GAO's survey (63 of 74) reported this would be useful. Education does not have a written plan or timeframe for identifying and disseminating best practices. As a result, Education may miss opportunities to help more students with disabilities successfully transition from school to work.

USAID is primarily responsible for administering ESF assistance to the West Bank and Gaza. Appropriations acts for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 included provisions for GAO to review the treatment, handling, and uses of funds provided through the ESF for assistance to the West Bank and Gaza. This report examines (1) the status of ESF assistance and projects provided to the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016, including project assistance and payments to PA creditors, and (2) the extent to which USAID conducted required vetting of PA creditors to ensure that this assistance would not support entities or individuals associated with terrorism and assessed PA ministries' capacity to use ESF assistance as intended. GAO reviewed relevant laws and regulations and USAID financial data, policies, procedures, and documents. GAO also interviewed USAID and State Department officials. As of March 2018, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) had allocated about $545 million of funding appropriated to the Economic Support Fund (ESF) for assistance in the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016.

USAID's obligations for project assistance in the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 supported three development objectives—Economic Growth and Infrastructure ($239 million), Investing in the Next Generation ($107 million), and Governance and Civic Engagement (about $25 million). In fiscal years 2015 and 2016, USAID made payments directly to PA creditors—two Israeli fuel companies, to cover debts for petroleum purchases, and a local Palestinian bank, to pay off a line of credit used for PA medical referrals to six hospitals in the East Jerusalem Hospital network. USAID vetted PA creditors to ensure that the program assistance would not provide support to entities or individuals associated with terrorism and also conducted external assessments and financial audits of PA ministries of Health and Finance and Planning. USAID documentation showed that, as required, officials checked the vetting status of each PA creditor within 12 months before USAID signed its debt relief grant agreements with the PA. In addition, although USAID determined that it was not legally required to assess the PA Ministry of Health's medical referral services and the Ministry of Finance and Planning's petroleum procurement system, the agency commissioned external assessments of both ministries. These assessments found some weaknesses in both ministries' systems; however, USAID mission officials stated that these weaknesses did not affect USAID debt relief payments to the PA creditors. Nevertheless, USAID took additional steps to mitigate the identified weaknesses. For example, a USAID contractor worked with the Ministry of Health to update, revise, and approve guidelines for medical referrals. In addition, USAID commissioned financial audits of the debt relief grant agreements between USAID and the PA for direct payments to PA creditors in fiscal year 2015 and 2016.

{"pred": " \n\nThis patent describes a method for simulating blood flow in a vascular segment during angiography examinations to validate computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations for individual patients. The method involves several steps: recording a 3D image dataset of the examination region, generating a 3D vascular model, capturing a contrast agent propagation using dynamic 2D angiography, inputting blood flow parameters, performing a CFD simulation, generating virtual 2D angiography, determining a degree of correspondence between real and virtual angiography, and iteratively optimizing the CFD simulation based on the degree of correspondence. Key evidence includes the comparison of real and virtual angiography to validate the CFD simulation, and the use of a degree of correspondence to iteratively adjust the simulation parameters. Unique aspects of the method include the use of dynamic 2D angiography to capture contrast agent propagation and the iterative optimization process to improve the accuracy of the CFD simulation. The method aims to provide a more accurate and personalized approach to understanding blood flow dynamics in vascular segments, particularly in the context of aneurysms and other pathological conditions. The patent highlights the importance of aligning the CFD simulation with real-world observations to ensure the reliability of the simulation results for clinical applications. The method also addresses the challenge of obtaining precise and validated simulation results for individual patients, which is crucial for developing effective treatment strategies.

The text traces the evolution from the early days of the Continental Congress to the present, highlighting how emergency powers have increasingly become rooted in statutory law rather than relying solely on the President's constitutional authority. Key evidence includes the National Emergencies Act of 1976, which established procedures for declaring and regulating national emergencies, and the numerous statutes that delegate emergency powers to the President. The passage argues that while the President retains significant discretion in exercising emergency powers, these powers are now more circumscribed and regulated by statutory law. Unique points include the tension between the expansive view of presidential power advocated by Theodore Roosevelt and the more limited view espoused by William Howard Taft, reflecting broader debates about the scope of executive authority. The text also notes that the National Emergencies Act of 1976 marked a significant shift in how emergency powers are managed, shifting from continuous availability to requiring formal declarations and periodic review. The passage concludes by noting that while the National Emergencies Act has not been revisited since its passage, there remains potential for further reforms and improvements in this area. The main argument is that the exercise of emergency powers in the U.S. has evolved from a more flexible, constitutional basis to a more statutory and regulated framework, with the President's role increasingly defined by both legal and personal interpretations of the office. The key evidence includes the historical context of emergency powers, the National Emergencies Act, and the contrasting views of Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft on the scope of presidential authority. The unique point is the shift from continuous availability of emergency powers to the requirement for formal declarations and periodic review under the National Emergencies Act.

Through legislation, Congress has made a great many delegations of authority in this regard over the past 230 years. There are, however, limits and restraints upon the President in his exercise of emergency powers. With the exception of the habeas corpus clause, the Constitution makes no allowance for the suspension of any of its provisions during a national emergency. Disputes over the constitutionality or legality of the exercise of emergency powers are judicially reviewable. Both the judiciary and Congress, as co-equal branches, can restrain the executive regarding emergency powers. So can public opinion.

The FCC emphasizes the importance of ensuring Americans have access to broadband, particularly in rural, insular, and high-cost areas. The FCC administers various programs, such as the High-Cost program and the Connect America Fund, to subsidize broadband deployment in unserved or underserved areas. However, the current Form 477 data collection process used by FCC to measure broadband availability does not accurately capture the actual broadband access on tribal lands. This is due to overstatements of availability, lack of standardized data collection methods, and failure to collect data on factors that affect broadband access, such as affordability, service quality, and denials of service. Additionally, FCC lacks a formal process to obtain input from tribes on the accuracy of the broadband data. The National Broadband Plan and the Government Performance and Results Act emphasize the need for accurate and reliable data to measure progress toward increasing broadband access. The FCC's reliance on inaccurate data could lead to overestimating broadband access and hindering the ability to target federal broadband funding to the areas most in need. The FCC should develop methods to collect and report accurate and complete data on broadband access specific to tribal lands, establish a formal process to obtain tribal input on the accuracy of provider-submitted broadband data, and obtain feedback from tribal stakeholders and providers on the effectiveness of FCC's tribal engagement guidance. These actions would help ensure that the FCC is making progress on reducing the digital divide on tribal lands and targeting broadband funding to the areas most in need. Key evidence includes the overstatement of broadband availability on tribal lands due to the current data collection methods, the lack of standardized data collection methods, and the failure to collect data on factors that affect broadband access. Unique points include the need for more granular data collection targeted to specific areas, such as large, rural census blocks with low population densities, and the importance of involving tribes in the validation of broadband data.

Congress has prioritized identifying and targeting funds to unserved areas. FCC uses data from broadband providers to develop maps and reports depicting broadband availability in the United States, with specific information on tribal lands. GAO was asked to review FCC's efforts to collect broadband data for tribal lands. This report examines the extent to which: (1) FCC's approach to collecting broadband data accurately captures broadband access on tribal lands and (2) FCC obtains tribal input on the data. GAO interviewed stakeholders from 25 tribal governments or tribally owned providers, and visited nine tribal lands. The selected tribes varied geographically and in levels of broadband availability, among other characteristics. GAO also reviewed FCC's rulemakings on broadband data and interviewed other tribal stakeholders, FCC officials, and 13 non-tribal broadband providers selected to include a diversity of technologies. Provider and tribal interviews were based on non-generalizable samples. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) collects data on broadband availability from providers, but these data do not accurately or completely capture broadband access on tribal lands. Specifically, FCC collects data on broadband availability; these data capture where providers may have broadband infrastructure. However, FCC considers broadband to be “available” for an entire census block if the provider could serve at least one location in the census block. This leads to overstatements of service for specific locations like tribal lands (see figure). FCC, tribal stakeholders, and providers have noted that this approach leads to overstatements of broadband availability. Because FCC uses these data to measure broadband access, it also overstates broadband access—the ability to obtain service—on tribal lands. Additionally, FCC does not collect information on several factors—such as affordability, quality, and denials of service—that FCC and tribal stakeholders stated can affect the extent to which Americans living on tribal lands can access broadband services. FCC provides broadband funding for unserved areas based on its broadband data. Overstatements of access limit FCC's and tribal stakeholders' abilities to target broadband funding to such areas. For example, some tribal officials stated that inaccurate data have affected their ability to plan their own broadband networks and obtain funding to address broadband gaps on their lands. By developing and implementing methods for collecting and reporting accurate and complete data on broadband access specific to tribal lands, FCC would be better able to target federal broadband funding to tribal areas that need it the most and to more accurately assess FCC's progress toward its goal of increasing all Americans' access to affordable broadband. FCC does not have a formal process to obtain tribal input on the accuracy of provider-submitted broadband data. In the National Broadband Plan , FCC highlighted the need for a targeted approach to improve broadband availability data for tribal lands. As outlined in the plan, such an approach would include working with tribes to ensure that information is accurate and useful. About half of the tribal stakeholders GAO interviewed raised concerns that FCC relies solely on data from providers, and most stated FCC should work with tribes to improve the accuracy of FCC's data. Establishing a formal process to obtain input from tribal governments on the accuracy of provider-submitted broadband data could help improve the accuracy of FCC's broadband data for tribal lands.

Key challenges include difficulties in acquiring suitable land, estimating costs, and using all available data to target unserved veteran populations. Specifically, NCA has faced issues with land acquisition in Chicago, Elko, Indianapolis, and Los Angeles, leading to delays. Additionally, NCA's cost estimates for rural initiative sites have significantly increased, raising concerns about the reliability of its cost-estimating guidance. NCA's methodology for identifying unserved veteran populations also relies heavily on county-level data, which may not accurately reflect the true needs of unserved areas. Using more precise census tract data could better inform NCA's grant-making decisions and improve the allocation of resources to serve unserved veterans. Despite these challenges, NCA has made some progress in increasing access to burial options, but more needs to be done to meet its strategic goal of providing reasonable access to 95% of veterans. The report recommends that NCA revise its cost-estimating procedures to better incorporate best practices and use census tract data to more accurately identify unserved veteran populations. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has acknowledged the recommendation and committed to updating its procedures accordingly.

The House Appropriations Committee has expressed concerns that there are geographic pockets where veterans remain unserved by burial options. House Report 115-188 accompanying a bill for the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018, includes a provision for GAO to examine veterans' access to burial options. This report (1) describes VA's plan for increasing reasonable access to burial options for veterans and (2) assesses VA's progress in implementing its plan and any challenges experienced. GAO reviewed applicable VA and NCA documents, compared NCA's cost-estimating practices with GAO's cost-estimating 12 steps, and met with cognizant officials regarding NCA's efforts to provide reasonable access to burial options. Within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) has a plan to establish 18 new national cemeteries to increase reasonable access to burial options for veterans. NCA defines reasonable access as a national or state veterans' cemetery being located within 75 miles of veterans' homes. Key parts of NCA's plan include establishing 13 urban and rural initiative national cemeteries and awarding grant funds to state applicants for establishing new state veterans' cemeteries. NCA has made limited progress in implementing its plan to increase burial access and is years behind its original schedule for opening new cemeteries. For example, NCA has opened only two of its planned urban and rural initiative sites and is behind its original schedule for the other 11 (see fig. below). The primary factor delaying NCA's completion of these cemeteries has been challenges in acquiring suitable land. NCA has also been challenged in producing accurate estimates of construction costs for most of its rural initiative sites. Cost estimates have increased more than 200 percent (from about $7 million to $24 million) for these sites, and NCA's guidance for developing cost estimates for the cemeteries does not fully incorporate the 12 steps identified in cost-estimating leading practices—such as conducting a risk and uncertainty analysis or a sensitivity analysis. As a result, NCA is not well positioned to provide reliable and valid cost estimates to better inform decisions to enhance veterans' cemetery access.

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (VAMC) officials are responsible for reviewing the clinical care delivered by their privileged providers—physicians and dentists who are approved to independently perform specific services—after concerns are raised. The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care. For example, GAO found that after one VAMC failed to report to the NPDB or SLBs a provider who resigned to avoid an adverse privileging action, a non-VA hospital in the same city took an adverse privileging action against that same provider for the same reason 2 years later."], "length": 25833}

While 42 states require health care providers to notify child protective services (CPS) about substance-affected infants, definitions and enforcement of these requirements vary. States face challenges in developing and implementing plans of safe care for these infants, including staffing and resource limitations, confidentiality restrictions, and uncertainty about the scope of required plans.

Unique points include the need for clearer definitions and parameters for plans of safe care and the potential for collaboration between CPS and other agencies to manage the increased caseloads resulting from the opioid epidemic. The report concludes that additional guidance and assistance from HHS would benefit states in better implementing protections and services for children and families affected by substance use. HHS did not concur with the recommendation to provide additional guidance and technical assistance to states, citing existing flexibility and ongoing technical assistance efforts. However, the report argues that more specific guidance addressing these concerns would be beneficial. **Summary:**\n\nThe Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) provides federal funding to states to improve their child protective service systems, particularly for infants affected by prenatal substance abuse. States must submit plans and annual data reports to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) detailing their efforts. Forty-two states require health care providers to notify child protective services (CPS) about substance-affected infants, but definitions and enforcement vary. States face challenges in developing and implementing plans of safe care, including staffing and resource limitations, confidentiality restrictions, and uncertainty about the scope of required plans. Technical assistance from the National Center on Substance Abuse and Child Welfare (NCSACW) and guidance from HHS have been provided, but additional clarity and support are needed. Key evidence includes varying state policies, challenges in developing plans of safe care, and limited federal assistance. The report recommends that HHS provide additional guidance and technical", "answers": ["Under CAPTA, states perform a range of prevention activities, including addressing the needs of infants born with prenatal drug exposure. The number of children under the age of 1 entering foster care increased by about 15 percent from fiscal years 2012 through 2015. Child welfare professionals attribute the increase to the opioid epidemic. GAO was asked to examine the steps states are taking to implement CAPTA requirements on substance-affected infants and related amendments enacted in 2016. This report examines (1) the extent to which states have adopted policies and procedures to notify CPS of substance-affected infants; (2) state efforts to develop plans of safe care, and associated challenges; and (3) steps HHS has taken to help states implement the provisions. To obtain this information, GAO surveyed state CPS directors in all 50 states and the District of Columbia and reached a 100 percent response rate. GAO also visited 3 states (Kentucky, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania); reviewed relevant documents such as federal laws and regulations, and HHS guidance; and interviewed HHS officials. GAO did not assess states' compliance with CAPTA requirements. All states reported adopting, to varying degrees, policies and procedures regarding health care providers notifying child protective services (CPS) about infants affected by opioids or other substances. Under the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA), as amended, governors are required to provide assurances that the states have laws or programs that include policies and procedures to address the needs of infants affected by prenatal substance use. This is to include health care providers notifying CPS of substance-affected infants. In response to GAO's survey, 42 states reported having policies and procedures that require health care providers to notify CPS about substance-affected infants and 8 states reported having policies that encourage notification. The remaining 1 state has a policy requiring health care providers to assess the needs of mothers and infants and if they conclude that infants are at risk for abuse or neglect, CPS is notified. In response to GAO's survey, 49 states reported that their CPS agency has policies to develop a plan of safe care; 2 reported not having such a requirement. Under CAPTA, states are required to develop a plan of safe care for substance-affected infants. Although not defined in law, a plan of safe care generally entails an assessment of the family's situation and a plan for connecting families to appropriate services to stabilize the family and ensure the child's safety and well-being. States reported that plans typically address the infant's safety needs, immediate medical needs, and the caregiver's substance use treatment needs. However, officials in the 3 states GAO visited noted challenges, including uncertainty about what to include in plans and the level of intervention needed for infants at low risk of abuse or neglect. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has provided technical assistance and guidance to states to implement these CAPTA requirements. Most states reported in GAO's survey that additional guidance and assistance would be very or extremely helpful for addressing their challenges. Nevertheless, HHS officials told GAO that the agency does not anticipate issuing additional written guidance, but that states can access technical assistance through their regional offices and the National Center on Substance Abuse and Child Welfare—a resource center funded by HHS. However, of the 37 states that reported on the helpfulness of the assistance they have received, 19 said it was only moderately helpful to not helpful. States offered suggestions for improving the assistance, such as developing substance abuse training materials for staff and holding video conferences with other states to share information. In October 2017, HHS officials explained that some states have submitted plans that include details on how they are addressing the CAPTA requirements. HHS officials reported that some of the plans submitted to date indicated that states are not meeting the requirements and those states have been asked to develop program improvement plans. Without more specific guidance and assistance to enhance states' understanding of CAPTA requirements and better address known challenges such as the ones described in this report, states may miss an opportunity to provide more effective protections and services for the children and families most in need. GAO recommends that HHS provide additional guidance and technical assistance to states to address known challenges and enhance their understanding of requirements. HHS did not concur with the recommendation. As discussed in the report, GAO continues to believe that added guidance would benefit states."], "length": 27713}

Shared U.S.-Israel concerns about Iran and its allies on the nuclear issue and in Syria and Lebanon. Israeli-Palestinian issues. Israeli domestic political issues, including elections scheduled for 2019. Israel relies on a number of strengths to manage potential threats to its security and existence. It maintains conventional military superiority relative to neighboring states and the Palestinians. It also takes measures to deter attack and defend its population and borders from evolving asymmetric threats such as rockets and missiles, cross-border tunneling, drones, and cyberattacks. Additionally, Israel has an undeclared but presumed nuclear weapons capability. Against a backdrop of strong bilateral cooperation, Israel's leaders and supporters routinely make the case that Israel's security and the broader stability of the region remain critically important for U.S. interests. A 10-year bilateral military aid memorandum of understanding (MOU)—signed in 2016—commits the United States to provide Israel $3.3 billion in Foreign Military Financing annually from FY2019 to FY2028, along with additional amounts from Defense Department accounts for missile defense. All of these amounts remain subject to congressional appropriations. Israeli officials seek to counter Iranian regional influence and prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu released new Israeli intelligence on Iran's nuclear program in April 2018, days before President Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 international agreement that constrains Iran's nuclear activities. It is unclear whether Israel might take future military action in Iran if Iranian nuclear activities resume. Since 2018, Israel has conducted a number of military operations in Syria against Iran and its allies, including Lebanese Hezbollah. Israel and Iran also appear to be competing for military advantage over each other at the Israel-Lebanon border. Amid uncertainty in the area, in March 2019 President Trump recognized Israel's claim to sovereignty over the Golan Heights, changing long-standing U.S. policy that held—in line with U.N. Security Council Resolution 497 from 1981—the Golan was occupied Syrian territory whose final status was subject to Israel-Syria negotiation. The prospects for an Israeli-Palestinian peace process are complicated by many factors. Palestinian leaders cut off high-level political contacts with the Trump Administration after it recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital in December 2017. U.S.-Palestinian tensions have since worsened amid U.S. cutoffs of funding to the Palestinians and diplomatic moves—including the May 2018 opening of the U.S. embassy to Israel in Jerusalem. Palestinian leaders interpreted these actions as prejudicing their claims to a capital in Jerusalem and to a just resolution of Palestinian refugee claims. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has welcomed these U.S. actions. The Trump Administration has suggested that it will release a proposed peace plan after Israeli elections, which are scheduled for April 9, 2019. Speculation continues about how warming ties between Israel and Arab Gulf states may affect Israeli-Palestinian diplomacy, though Saudi Arabia said that the U.S. policy change on the Golan Heights would negatively affect the peace process. Bouts of tension and violence between Israel and Hamas in Gaza have continued—reportedly accompanied by indirect talks between the two parties that are being brokered by Egypt and aim for a long-term cease-fire.

FTC enforces this authority by investigating complaints and initiating enforcement actions against companies that fail to protect consumer data or mislead consumers about their data practices. While FTC has successfully addressed various privacy concerns, such as data breaches, public disclosure of sensitive information, and consumer lack of control over their data, some stakeholders argue that FTC's current approach is limited. They advocate for a comprehensive federal privacy statute, APA section 553 notice-and-comment rulemaking authority, and civil penalty authority for first-time violations of a statute. The absence of a comprehensive federal privacy statute affects FTC's enforcement capabilities, and some stakeholders believe that a new privacy statute could enhance Internet privacy oversight by providing clear rules of the road for companies and creating uniform standards for all players in the Internet ecosystem. Additionally, the lack of clarity on when FTC will take enforcement action and the potential limitations on FTC's remedies in \"unfair practices\" cases highlight the need for further discussion and potential legislative action to address these issues. The debate over the federal government's role in overseeing Internet privacy suggests that comprehensive legislation addressing Internet privacy could help enhance consumer protections and provide flexibility to address a rapidly evolving Internet environment.

GAO was asked to review federal oversight of Internet privacy. This report addresses, among other objectives: (1) how FTC and FCC have overseen consumers' Internet privacy and (2) selected stakeholders' views on the strengths and limitations of how Internet privacy currently is overseen and how, if it all, this approach could be enhanced. GAO evaluated FTC and FCC Internet privacy enforcement actions and authorities and interviewed representatives from industry, consumer advocacy groups, and academia; FTC and FCC staff; former FTC and FCC commissioners; and officials from other federal oversight agencies. Industry stakeholders were selected to represent different sectors, and academics were selected because of their expertise in privacy, consumer protection, and regulatory issues. The United States does not have a comprehensive Internet privacy law governing the collection, use, and sale or other disclosure of consumers' personal information. At the federal level, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) currently has the lead in overseeing Internet privacy, using its statutory authority under the FTC Act to protect consumers from unfair and deceptive trade practices. However, to date FTC has not issued regulations for Internet privacy other than those protecting financial privacy and the Internet privacy of children, which were required by law. For FTC Act violations, FTC may promulgate regulations but is required to use procedures that differ from traditional notice-and-comment processes and that FTC staff said add time and complexity. In the last decade, FTC has filed 101 enforcement actions regarding Internet privacy; nearly all actions resulted in settlement agreements requiring action by the companies. In most of these cases, FTC did not levy civil penalties because it lacked such authority for those particular violations. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has had a limited role in overseeing Internet privacy. From 2015 to 2017, FCC asserted jurisdiction over the privacy practices of Internet service providers. In 2016, FCC promulgated privacy rules for Internet service providers that Congress later repealed. FTC resumed privacy oversight of Internet service providers in June 2018. Stakeholders GAO interviewed had varied views on the current Internet privacy enforcement approach and how it could be enhanced. Most Internet industry stakeholders said they favored FTC's current approach—direct enforcement of its unfair and deceptive practices statutory authority, rather than promulgating and enforcing regulations implementing that authority. These stakeholders said that the current approach allows for flexibility and that regulations could hinder innovation. Other stakeholders, including consumer advocates and most former FTC and FCC commissioners GAO interviewed, favored having FTC issue and enforce regulations. Some stakeholders said a new data-protection agency was needed to oversee consumer privacy. Stakeholders identified three main areas in which Internet privacy oversight could be enhanced: Statute . Some stakeholders told GAO that an overarching Internet privacy statute could enhance consumer protection by clearly articulating to consumers, industry, and agencies what behaviors are prohibited. Rulemaking . Some stakeholders said that regulations can provide clarity, enforcement fairness, and flexibility. Officials from two other consumer protection agencies said their rulemaking authority assists in their oversight efforts and works together with enforcement actions. Civil penalty authority. Some stakeholders said FTC's Internet privacy enforcement could be more effective with authority to levy civil penalties for first-time violations of the FTC Act. Comprehensive Internet privacy legislation that establishes specific standards and includes traditional notice-and-comment rulemaking and broader civil penalty authority could enhance the federal government's ability to protect consumer privacy. Congress should consider developing comprehensive legislation on Internet privacy that would enhance consumer protections and provide flexibility to address a rapidly evolving Internet environment. Issues that should be considered include what authorities agencies should have in order to oversee Internet privacy, including appropriate rulemaking authority."], "length": 27546}

Key findings include:\n\n1. From October 2013 to March 2017, five VA medical centers conducted reviews for 148 providers but could not document 46% of these reviews, and in some cases, reviews were not conducted at all. Specifically, 26 providers lacked documentation for focused professional practice evaluations (FPPEs) for cause, and 21 providers had required FPPEs for cause that were never conducted. Additionally, 8 providers lacked documentation for retrospective reviews, and 12 providers had no documented reviews despite concerns about their care.\n\n2. Reviews were often delayed, with 16 providers not initiating reviews for 3 months to multiple years after concerns were raised. Two factors contributed to these issues: VHA policy inadequacies, such as lack of documentation requirements for certain reviews and no timeliness requirement for initiating reviews, and insufficient VHA oversight of the credentialing and privileging processes.\n\n3. Only one of nine providers who faced adverse privileging actions or resigned/retired while under investigation was reported to the NPDB, and none were reported to state licensing boards as required. Providers were not reported due to misunderstandings of VHA policies and a lack of network oversight to ensure timely reporting.\n\n4. The report recommends that VHA require documentation of all reviews, establish timeliness requirements, and strengthen oversight by requiring networks to ensure reviews are documented and initiated in a timely manner. Additionally, VHA should require networks to establish processes for overseeing VA medical centers to ensure timely reporting to the NPDB and state licensing boards. The VA concurred with these recommendations and plans to implement them. The report highlights the importance of robust oversight and documentation to ensure patient safety and accountability in healthcare settings. The findings underscore the need for clear policies and effective oversight mechanisms to address deficiencies in provider care and ensure compliance with reporting requirements.

{"pred": " \n\nPassage 4 discusses the effects of radiation exposure and the approaches taken by federal agencies to protect public health. According to the National Academies, the risk of cancer increases with radiation exposure, and the linear no-threshold model is used to estimate cancer risks from low-dose radiation. Federal agencies, such as NRC, EPA, and FDA, follow the advice of scientific advisory bodies and use this model to set dose limits for radiation exposure. The report notes that while there is uncertainty in estimating cancer risks from very low doses of radiation, agencies continue to use the linear no-threshold model in the absence of convincing evidence that low levels of radiation are beneficial or not harmful. The passage also highlights that federal agencies have varied approaches to regulating radiation exposure, with NRC setting limits for nuclear power plant workers and FDA focusing on regulating the maximum radiation output of medical equipment. Additionally, the report mentions that from fiscal year 2012 to 2016, federal agencies obligated $209.6 million for research on the health effects of low-dose radiation, but there was no collaborative mechanism to address overall research priorities in this area. The passage concludes by recommending that the Secretary of Energy lead the development of a mechanism for interagency collaboration to determine roles and responsibilities for addressing priorities related to research on the health effects of low-dose radiation. Key evidence includes the use of the linear no-threshold model by federal agencies and the decrease in annual funding for low-dose radiation research from 2012 to 2016. Unique points include the emphasis on the principle of making every reasonable effort to keep radiation doses as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) and the suggestion that a collaborative mechanism could help reduce uncertainty in predicting cancer risk from low-dose radiation. The report also highlights the importance of leadership in developing such a mechanism, with DOE being well-positioned to lead this effort due to its past experience and current legal mandate for research related to radiation protection.

The Department of Energy (DOE), Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Food and Drug Administration generally used the advice of scientific advisory bodies to develop and apply radiation protection requirements and guidance for workers and the public in the radiation exposure settings that GAO reviewed. These settings were: (1) the operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants; (2) the cleanup of sites with radiological contamination; (3) the use of medical equipment that produces radiation; and (4) accidental or terrorism-related exposure to radiation. Specifically, the agencies relied on the advice of three scientific advisory bodies that supported the use of a model that assumes the risk of cancer increases with every incremental radiation exposure. Accordingly, the agencies have set regulatory dose limits and issued guidance to confine exposure to levels that reduce the risk of cancer, while recognizing that scientific uncertainties occur in estimating cancer risks from low-dose radiation. For example, NRC requires nuclear power plants to consider measures for limiting workers' exposure below NRC's regulatory dose limit, such as by using robots for maintenance work in radiation areas. GAO identified seven federal agencies that funded research on low-dose radiation's health effects. In fiscal years 2012 to 2016, DOE, NRC, EPA, and four other federal agencies obligated about $210 million for such research . Although the agencies have collaborated on individual projects on radiation's health effects, they have not established a collaborative mechanism to set research priorities. GAO's previous work has shown that federal agencies can use such mechanisms to implement interagency collaboration to develop and coordinate sound science policies. In the past, DOE took a leading role in this area because DOE provided stable funding and advocated for greater coordination on research on low-dose radiation's health effects. However, since fiscal year 2012, DOE has phased out funding for one of its main research programs in this area. This has created a void in coordination efforts among federal agencies, and no other agency has stepped forward to fill this void. Because of DOE's prior experience as a leader in this area of research and its research responsibility under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, it could play an important role in helping federal agencies establish a coordinating mechanism for low-dose radiation research.

{"pred": " \n\nPassage 1 discusses the U.S. corporate income tax system and corporate inversions, which involve U.S. corporations changing their country of residence to reduce tax liability. The U.S. tax system taxes both domestic and foreign income, but allows deferral of foreign income until repatriated. The 2004 American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA) introduced anti-inversion provisions, but inversions continued through mergers with foreign firms. The 2014 Treasury regulations further restricted inversions, particularly those involving smaller foreign firms. The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) made significant changes to the corporate tax system, including a lower corporate tax rate, a shift to a territorial tax system for foreign earnings, and provisions to discourage inversions. Despite these changes, inversions slowed but did not cease entirely. The passage highlights the complex interplay between tax policy, corporate strategy, and regulatory responses in shaping corporate tax practices. Key evidence includes data on the number of inversions and the types of transactions used, as well as legislative and regulatory changes. Unique points include the use of thin capitalization rules and the development of new regulations targeting specific inversion strategies.

The passage emphasizes the complexity of the U.S. corporate tax system and the challenges in preventing tax avoidance through corporate restructuring. Key evidence includes data", "answers": ["News reports in the late 1990s and early 2000s drew attention to a phenomenon sometimes called corporate \"inversions\" or \"expatriations\": instances where U.S. firms reorganize their structure so that the \"parent\" element of the group is a foreign corporation rather than a corporation chartered in the United States. The main objective of these transactions was tax savings, and they involved little to no shift in actual economic activity. Bermuda and the Cayman Islands (countries with no corporate income tax) were the locations of many of the newly created parent corporations. These types of inversions largely ended with the enactment of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (JOBS Act; P.L. 108-357), which denied the tax benefits of an inversion if the original U.S. stockholders owned 80% or more of the new firm. The act effectively ended shifts to tax havens where no real business activity took place. However, two avenues for inverting remained. The act allowed a firm to invert if it has substantial business operations in the country where the new parent was to be located; the regulations at one point set a 10% level of these business operations. Several inversions using the business activity test resulted in Treasury regulations in 2012 that increased the activity requirement to 25%, effectively closing off this method. Firms could also invert by merging with a foreign company if the original U.S. stockholders owned less than 80% of the new firm. If the original U.S. shareholders owned less than 60%, the firm was not considered as inverting. Two features made a country an attractive destination: a low corporate tax rate and a territorial tax system that did not tax foreign source income. The U.K. joined countries such as Ireland, Switzerland, and Canada as targets for inverting when it adopted a territorial tax in 2009. At the same time, the U.K. also lowered its rate (from 25% to 20% by 2015). Inverted firms could reduce worldwide taxes by stripping taxable earnings out of the new U.S. subsidiary, largely through allocating debt to that subsidiary. Soon after, several high-profile companies indicated an interest in merging with a non-U.S. headquartered company, including Pfizer, Chiquita, AbbVie, and Burger King. This \"second wave\" of inversions again raised concerns about an erosion of the U.S. tax base. Chiquita and AbbVie canceled their plans in the wake of 2014 Treasury regulations, but Burger King and other firms completed merger plans. Pfizer subsequently terminated its planned merger with Allergan after Treasury regulations issued in 2016. Evidence suggests that these Treasury regulations have been an important factor in subsequently decreasing these merger-related inversions. Two policy options had been discussed in response: a general reform of the U.S. corporate tax and specific provisions to deal with tax-motivated international mergers. In December 2017, P.L. 115-97 (popularly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) lowered the corporate tax rate as part of broader tax reform which some argued would slow the rate of inversions. Other tax reform proposals suggested that if the United States moved to a territorial tax, the incentive to invert would be eliminated. There were concerns that a territorial tax could worsen the profit-shifting that already exists among multinational firms. P.L. 115-97, while moving in some ways to a territorial tax, also instituted a number of measures aimed at combatting profit shifting, including a global minimum tax on intangible income that limited the tax benefits of a territorial tax. The second option is to directly target inversions. The 2017 act included several provisions that discouraged inversions. In addition, further anti-inversion provisions have been introduced, most recently H.R. 5108 and S. 2459 in the 115th Congress, to treat all firms in which former U.S. shareholders have more than 50% ownership (or in which management and control is in the United States) as U.S. firms. These bills also provided that debt could also be allocated to the U.S. member of a worldwide operation in proportion to the U.S. ownership of assets."], "length": 27288}

The Navy's FY2020 budget requests funding for the procurement of the fifth and sixth ships in the program. Key issues for Congress include approving the funding request, determining the number of oilers needed to support future operations, and deciding whether to equip the ships with enhanced self-defense capabilities. The TAO-205 class is designed to have similar capabilities to the existing Henry J. Kaiser class, with double-hull construction for safety. The program has matured critical technologies and stabilized the design, with lead ship construction beginning in 2018. Delays due to a flooding incident at a shipyard have affected the delivery schedule for subsequent ships. Congress has provided funding for an additional ship in fiscal year 2019, and the Navy plans to compete a new contract for the remaining 12 ships using the knowledge gained from the first four. The program adheres to best practices in shipbuilding and leverages commercial vessel designs to minimize risk. Congress should consider the Navy's budget request, the operational needs, and the potential impact on the U.S. shipbuilding industrial base when making decisions about the TAO-205 program. The program's success hinges on maintaining a robust and adaptable logistics force to support distributed maritime operations and address evolving security challenges.

The main objective of these transactions was tax savings, and they involved little to no shift in actual economic activity. Bermuda and the Cayman Islands (countries with no corporate income tax) were the locations of many of the newly created parent corporations. These types of inversions largely ended with the enactment of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (JOBS Act; P.L. 108-357), which denied the tax benefits of an inversion if the original U.S. stockholders owned 80% or more of the new firm. The act effectively ended shifts to tax havens where no real business activity took place. However, two avenues for inverting remained. The act allowed a firm to invert if it has substantial business operations in the country where the new parent was to be located; the regulations at one point set a 10% level of these business operations. Several inversions using the business activity test resulted in Treasury regulations in 2012 that increased the activity requirement to 25%, effectively closing off this method. Firms could also invert by merging with a foreign company if the original U.S. stockholders owned less than 80% of the new firm. If the original U.S. shareholders owned less than 60%, the firm was not considered as inverting. Two features made a country an attractive destination: a low corporate tax rate and a territorial tax system that did not tax foreign source income. The U.K. joined countries such as Ireland, Switzerland, and Canada as targets for inverting when it adopted a territorial tax in 2009. At the same time, the U.K. also lowered its rate (from 25% to 20% by 2015). Inverted firms could reduce worldwide taxes by stripping taxable earnings out of the new U.S. subsidiary, largely through allocating debt to that subsidiary. Soon after, several high-profile companies indicated an interest in merging with a non-U.S. headquartered company, including Pfizer, Chiquita, AbbVie, and Burger King. This \"second wave\" of inversions again raised concerns about an erosion of the U.S. tax base. Chiquita and AbbVie canceled their plans in the wake of 2014 Treasury regulations, but Burger King and other firms completed merger plans. Pfizer subsequently terminated its planned merger with Allergan after Treasury regulations issued in 2016. Evidence suggests that these Treasury regulations have been an important factor in subsequently decreasing these merger-related inversions. Two policy options had been discussed in response: a general reform of the U.S. corporate tax and specific provisions to deal with tax-motivated international mergers. In December 2017, P.L. 115-97 (popularly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) lowered the corporate tax rate as part of broader tax reform which some argued would slow the rate of inversions. Other tax reform proposals suggested that if the United States moved to a territorial tax, the incentive to invert would be eliminated. There were concerns that a territorial tax could worsen the profit-shifting that already exists among multinational firms. P.L. 115-97, while moving in some ways to a territorial tax, also instituted a number of measures aimed at combatting profit shifting, including a global minimum tax on intangible income that limited the tax benefits of a territorial tax. The second option is to directly target inversions. The 2017 act included several provisions that discouraged inversions. In addition, further anti-inversion provisions have been introduced, most recently H.R. 5108 and S. 2459 in the 115th Congress, to treat all firms in which former U.S. shareholders have more than 50% ownership (or in which management and control is in the United States) as U.S. firms. These bills also provided that debt could also be allocated to the U.S. member of a worldwide operation in proportion to the U.S. ownership of assets."], "length": 26852}
{"pred": " \n\nThe Fire Management Assistance Grant (FMAG) system, established under the Stafford Act, provides federal assistance for fire suppression activities on public or private forest land or grassland. States or tribes can request FMAGs when a fire is out of control and threatens to become a major disaster. Requests are evaluated based on criteria such as the threat to lives and property, the availability of state and local resources, and fire cost thresholds. The cost-sharing component requires state and local governments to cover 25% of the expenses. FEMA uses a no-year account, the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), to fund FMAGs, which are categorized into disaster relief costs and base funding. The DRF balance does not affect the issuance of FMAGs, and FMAGs do not reduce the amount of funding available for major disasters. Eligible expenses include equipment, supplies, mobilization, emergency work, and personal comfort and safety items. Hazard mitigation grants are now available for FMAG declarations, providing up to 15% of the first $2 billion of estimated aggregate amounts of disaster assistance. FMAGs are distinct from other federal assistance, primarily focusing on suppression operations on non-federal lands, with exceptions for comingled federal and non-federal land ownership. Cooperative agreements between federal, state, and other governmental or tribal partners can facilitate joint wildfire protection and response activities, potentially involving FMAGs and other federal assistance. Most fires on federal land are managed by the federal agency responsible for the land, but FMAGs can be used for suppression activities in mixed ownership areas under cooperative agreements.

{"pred": " \n\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) oversees the regulation of controlled substances to ensure their availability for legitimate uses while preventing diversion. Under the Disposal Act, DEA is responsible for implementing regulations that allow the public to safely dispose of unused controlled substances through various methods, including disposal bins, mail-back programs, and take-back events. DEA-authorized entities, such as pharmacies and hospitals, can install and maintain these bins, which must adhere to strict guidelines to prevent diversion. As of April 2017, only about 2.5% of eligible entities had registered to use disposal bins, with pharmacies being the most common type of authorized collector. Participation rates vary significantly by state, with North Dakota having the highest rate and Connecticut the lowest. Factors influencing low participation include costs, uncertainty over proper implementation, and existing alternative disposal options. Despite the low participation, about half of the U.S. population lived within 5 miles of a disposal bin, indicating potential for increased usage. Key evidence includes statistics on the number of authorized collectors, their locations, and the variation in participation rates across states. Unique points highlight the challenges in achieving widespread adoption due to regulatory complexities and financial considerations. The report concludes that while the infrastructure exists, efforts are needed to improve communication and reduce barriers to participation. The DEA acknowledges the importance of these efforts but notes that addressing cost and compliance issues falls outside their purview. The report recommends identifying cost-effective means for regular communication with stakeholders to enhance understanding and engagement.

The summary effectively conveys the main arguments, key evidence, and unique points from the passage,", "answers": ["In 2015, 3.8 million Americans reported misusing prescription drugs within the last month, and deaths from prescription opioids have more than quadrupled since 1999. About half of the people who reported misusing prescription drugs in 2015 received them from a friend or relative. One way to help prevent this kind of diversion and potential misuse is by providing secure and convenient ways to dispose of unused, unneeded, or expired prescription medications. The Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010 authorizes pharmacies and other entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances to also collect unused prescription drugs for disposal. In 2014, DEA finalized regulations for the implementation of the Act, establishing a voluntary process for eligible entities to become authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs using disposal bins. GAO was asked to review participation among authorized collectors that maintain disposal bins. In this report GAO describes (1) participation rates among entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs and (2) factors that affect participation. GAO analyzed the most currently available DEA data from April 2017 on entities eligible to participate and those participating as authorized collectors. GAO also conducted interviews with DEA officials and a nongeneralizable sample of 11 stakeholder organizations selected to illustrate different types of authorized collectors and long-term care facilities. GAO is not making any recommendations. DEA provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. GAO found that about 3 percent of pharmacies and other entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs for disposal have volunteered to do so. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) authorizes these entities to dispose of unused drugs to help reduce their potential misuse. Analysis of DEA data shows that as of April 2017, 2,233 of the 89,550 (2.49 percent) eligible entities—that is, certain entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances—had registered with DEA to use disposal bins to collect unused prescription drugs. Most—about 81 percent—of the authorized collectors were pharmacies, followed by hospitals or clinics. GAO also found that participation rates varied by state, though in 44 states less than 5 percent of the state's pharmacies and other eligible entities had registered to become authorized collectors. Stakeholders cited several factors that may explain why relatively few pharmacies and other eligible entities have registered with DEA as authorized collectors of unused drugs. Most notably, stakeholders representing authorized collectors told GAO that because participation is voluntary, the cost associated with maintaining a disposal bin—which includes purchasing and installing the bin according to DEA requirements and paying for the destruction of its contents—is an important factor to weigh against potential benefits. DEA noted that availability of disposal by law enforcement agencies also contributes to low participation."], "length": 25861}

In accordance with the DHS Appropriations Act, 2007, DHS established the CFATS program in 2007 to, among other things, identify and assess the security risk posed by chemical facilities. DHS inspects high-risk facilities after it approves facility security plans to ensure that the facilities are implementing required security measures and procedures. This statement summarizes progress and challenges related to DHS's CFATS program management. This statement is based on prior products GAO issued from July 2012 through June 2017, along with updates conducted in June 2018 on DHS actions to address prior GAO recommendations. To conduct the prior work, GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and DHS policies for administering the CFATS program, how DHS assesses risk, and data on high-risk chemical facilities. GAO also interviewed DHS officials and reviewed information on DHS actions to implement its prior recommendations. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has made progress addressing challenges that GAO's past work identified to managing the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) program. The following summarizes progress made and challenges remaining in key aspects of the program. Identifying high-risk chemical facilities. In July 2015, GAO reported that DHS used self-reported and unverified data to determine the risk of facilities holding toxic chemicals that could threaten surrounding communities if released. GAO recommended that DHS should better verify the accuracy of facility-reported data. DHS implemented this recommendation by revising its methodology so it now calculates the risk of toxic release, rather than relying on facilities to do so. Assessing risk and prioritizing facilities. In April 2013, GAO reported weaknesses in multiple aspects of DHS's risk assessment and prioritization approach. GAO made two recommendations for DHS to review and improve this process, including that DHS enhance its risk assessment approach to incorporate all of the elements of consequence, threat, and vulnerability associated with a terrorist attack involving certain chemicals. DHS launched a new risk assessment methodology in October 2016 and is currently gathering new or updated data from about 27,000 facilities to (1) determine which facilities should be categorized as high-risk because of the threat of sabotage, theft or diversion, or a toxic release and (2) assign those facilities deemed high risk to one of four risk-based tiers. GAO has ongoing work assessing these efforts and will report later this summer on the extent to which they fully address prior recommendations. Reviewing and approving facilities' site security plans . DHS is to review security plans and visit facilities to ensure their security measures meet DHS standards. In April 2013, GAO reported a 7 to 9 year backlog for these reviews and visits. In July 2015, GAO reported that DHS had made substantial progress in addressing the backlog—estimating that it could take between 9 and 12 months for DHS to review and approve security plans for the approximately 900 remaining facilities. DHS has since taken additional action to expedite these activities and has eliminated this backlog. Inspecting facilities and ensuring compliance. In July 2015, GAO reported that DHS conducted compliance inspections at 83 of the 1,727 facilities with approved security plans. GAO found that nearly half of the inspected facilities were not fully compliant with their approved security plans and that DHS did not have documented procedures for managing facilities' compliance. GAO recommended that DHS document procedures for managing compliance. As a result, DHS has developed an enforcement procedure and a draft compliance inspection procedure and expects to finalize the compliance inspection procedure by the end of fiscal year 2018. GAO has made various recommendations to strengthen DHS's management of the CFATS program, with which DHS has generally agreed. DHS has implemented or described planned actions to address most of these recommendations."], "length": 28249}

The 355-ship force-level goal is the result of a Force Structure Assessment (FSA) conducted by the Navy in 2016. The Navy states that a new FSA is now underway as the successor to the 2016 FSA. This new FSA, Navy officials state, is to be completed by the end of 2019. Navy officials have suggested in their public remarks that this new FSA could change the 355-ship figure, the planned mix of ships, or both. The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget requests funding for the procurement of 12 new ships, including one Gerald R.

If the FY2020 30-year shipbuilding plan is implemented, the Navy projects that it will achieve a total of 355 ships by FY2034. This is about 20 years sooner than projected under the Navy's FY2019 30-year shipbuilding plan—an acceleration primarily due to a decision announced by the Navy in April 2018, after the FY2019 plan was submitted, to increase the service lives of all DDG-51 destroyers to 45 years. Although the Navy projects that the fleet will reach a total of 355 ships in FY2034, the Navy in that year and subsequent years will not match the composition called for in the FY2016 FSA. One issue for Congress is whether the new FSA that the Navy is conducting will change the 355-ship force-level objective established by the 2016 FSA and, if so, in what ways.

{"pred": " \n\nPassage 1 discusses the Multiyear Procurement (MYP) and Block Buy Contracting (BBC) mechanisms used by the Department of Defense (DOD) for weapon procurement. MYP allows for a single contract covering multiple years of procurement, while BBC covers a longer period, typically up to seven years. Both mechanisms aim to reduce procurement costs by providing contractors with greater certainty and enabling them to invest in optimizing production processes. Key criteria for using MYP include significant savings, stable design, and realistic cost estimates. The use of MYP and BBC is currently limited, with only a few programs utilizing these methods. The report suggests that increased use of MYP and BBC could help DOD manage its budget more effectively, but also notes concerns about reduced flexibility in adjusting procurement plans. The text also highlights the importance of a permanent statute governing MYP, which currently exists, but lacks a similar statute for BBC. The Coast Guard, a military service, has never used MYP or BBC in its acquisition programs, despite being authorized to do so. The report concludes by noting that while MYP and BBC offer potential cost savings, their increased use would require careful consideration of the trade-offs between cost savings and flexibility in responding to changing strategic or budgetary circumstances. The evidence presented includes cost savings estimates ranging from less than 5% to over 15%, and examples of successful implementation in Navy shipbuilding programs. The report also emphasizes the need for a clear process for assessing the suitability of MYP and BBC for different programs. Unique points include the distinction between MYP and BBC, the potential for economic order quantity (EOQ) purchases, and the importance of cancellation penalties in maintaining contractor confidence. The report also notes that while MYP has been used less frequently in recent years, there is ongoing interest in its potential benefits. The text concludes by highlighting the need for a balanced approach to the use of MYP and BBC, taking into account both cost savings and flexibility considerations. The report also underscores the importance of transparency and oversight in the use of these mechanisms. The key evidence includes cost savings data, examples of successful implementation, and the current usage patterns of MYP and BBC in DOD programs. The report concludes by recommending that Congress consider the potential benefits and drawbacks of increased use of MYP and BBC, while also emphasizing the need for careful evaluation and oversight.

Compared to the standard or default approach of annual contracting, MYP and BBC have the potential for reducing weapon procurement costs by a few or several percent. Under annual contracting, DOD uses one or more contracts for each year's worth of procurement of a given kind of item. Under MYP, DOD instead uses a single contract for two to five years' worth of procurement of a given kind of item without having to exercise a contract option for each year after the first year. DOD needs congressional approval for each use of MYP. There is a permanent statute governing MYP contracting—10 U.S.C. 2306b. Under this statute, a program must meet several criteria to qualify for MYP. Compared with estimated costs under annual contracting, estimated savings for programs being proposed for MYP have ranged from less than 5% to more than 15%, depending on the particulars of the program in question, with many estimates falling in the range of 5% to 10%. In practice, actual savings from using MYP rather than annual contracting can be difficult to observe or verify because of cost growth during the execution of the contract due to changes in the program independent of the use of MYP rather than annual contracting. BBC is similar to MYP in that it permits DOD to use a single contract for more than one year's worth of procurement of a given kind of item without having to exercise a contract option for each year after the first year. BBC is also similar to MYP in that DOD needs congressional approval for each use of BBC. BBC differs from MYP in the following ways: There is no permanent statute governing the use of BBC. There is no requirement that BBC be approved in both a DOD appropriations act and an act other than a DOD appropriations act. Programs being considered for BBC do not need to meet any legal criteria to qualify for BBC, because there is no permanent statute governing the use of BBC that establishes such criteria. A BBC contract can cover more than five years of planned procurements. Economic order quantity (EOQ) authority—the authority to bring forward selected key components of the items to be procured under the contract and purchase the components in batch form during the first year or two of the contract—does not come automatically as part of BBC authority because there is no permanent statute governing the use of BBC that includes EOQ authority as an automatic feature. BBC contracts are less likely to include cancellation penalties. Potential issues for Congress concerning MYP and BBC include whether to use MYP and BBC in the future more frequently, less frequently, or about as frequently as they are currently used; whether to create a permanent statute to govern the use of BBC, analogous to the permanent statute that governs the use of MYP; and whether the Coast Guard should begin making use of MYP and BBC."], "length": 27525}

Within DOT, FTA is now implementing this authority. The DOT's Office of Inspector General has reported, though, that FTA faces challenges in carrying out its enhanced safety oversight. FRA, also in DOT, has long carried out safety oversight of freight, intercity passenger, and commuter railroads. GAO was asked to review various rail safety and oversight issues, including the differences between FRA's and FTA's rail safety oversight programs. This report examines (1) key characteristics of FRA's and FTA's rail safety oversight programs and (2) strengths and limitations of FRA's and FTA's rail safety oversight programs. GAO assessed FRA's and FTA's information about rail safety oversight activities against guidance from the Office of Management and Budget, leading practices developed by the transit industry, and federal standards for internal control. GAO also interviewed stakeholders, including rail operators chosen based on mode, size, and location. The Department of Transportation's (DOT) Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) and Federal Transit Administration (FTA) carry out different approaches to rail safety oversight. FRA has a more centralized safety oversight program for railroads, while FTA's program for oversight of rail transit safety largely relies on state safety agencies to monitor and enforce rail transit safety, as established in federal statute. Key characteristics of both programs include: (1) safety regulations, (2) inspections and other oversight activities, and (3) enforcement mechanisms to ensure that safety deficiencies are addressed (see figure). There are strengths and limitations to FRA's and FTA's approaches to their safety oversight missions, including how the two agencies develop safety regulations, conduct inspections, and carry out enforcement. The National Transportation Safety Board has reported, and stakeholders GAO spoke with generally agreed, that strengths of FRA's rail safety oversight program include its safety regulations, its risk-based inspection program, and its enforcement authorities. FRA also has potential limitations in its oversight framework, though, such as difficulty evaluating the effectiveness of its enforcement mechanisms. FTA has made some progress implementing changes to the rail transit safety program. However, FTA has not provided all the necessary guidance and support to states' safety agencies to ensure they develop appropriate and effective rail transit safety inspection programs. In particular, FTA has not provided states with guidance on how to develop and implement risk-based inspection programs. Though FTA has said that it will develop such guidance, it does not have a plan or timeline to do so. Without guidance from FTA on how to develop and carry out risk-based inspections, state safety agencies may not allocate their limited resources efficiently, and important safety issues may go undetected. In addition, FTA has not developed a process or methodology to evaluate whether state safety agency enforcement authorities and practices are effective. Without clear evidence that state safety agencies' enforcement is effective, states and FTA may not be able to compel rail transit operators to remedy safety deficiencies. As a result, deficiencies may remain for long periods, potentially contributing to safety incidents.

The main argument is that while agencies have made progress in estimating improper payments, there are still significant variations in their methodologies and processes that can affect the quality of the estimates. Key evidence includes the use of different sampling approaches, varying treatments of insufficient documentation and nonresponse cases, and the exclusion of recovered overpayments in some estimates. Unique points include the need for OMB to develop guidance on how agencies test to identify improper payments and clarify the treatment of nonresponse cases. Recommendations are made to OMB, DOD, OPM, and IRS to improve their processes and ensure that all improper payments are included in estimates. The report highlights the importance of addressing key risks, such as eligibility, in the estimation process to enhance the effectiveness of corrective actions. The data from fiscal year 2017 improper payment estimates by agency and program are provided to illustrate the current state of these efforts. The summary concludes by noting that without clear guidance and consistent methodologies, the usefulness of improper payment estimates for developing effective corrective actions may be limited. The report emphasizes the need for agencies to fully assess their processes and address key risks to improve the accuracy and comprehensiveness of their estimates. The key evidence and unique points underscore the importance of standardization and risk-based approaches in improving the quality of improper payment estimates. The report also notes that the treatment of recovered overpayments varies among agencies, which can lead to understated estimates and limit the ability to address these types of improper payments proactively. Overall, the passage argues for the development of standardized guidance to ensure consistency and accuracy in estimating improper payments across federal agencies.

Executive branch agencies are required to annually estimate improper payments for certain programs. Estimation of improper payments is key to understanding the extent of the problem and to developing effective corrective actions. Relevant laws and guidance provide agencies flexibility in developing estimates. This report describes agencies' processes to estimate improper payments in selected programs for fiscal year 2017 and the extent to which certain differences in these processes can affect the usefulness of the resulting estimates. GAO selected 10 programs across six agencies with the largest reported program outlays in fiscal years 2015 and 2016. For these programs, GAO reviewed relevant laws and guidance, analyzed agencies' policies and procedures, and interviewed officials at relevant agencies and OMB staff. The six agencies GAO reviewed reported taking various approaches related to key components of estimating improper payments—shown in the figure below—for 10 selected programs, which collectively reported outlays of over $2.5 trillion for fiscal year 2017. Sample selection. Eight of the 10 programs GAO reviewed reported using statistically valid approaches, and the remaining 2 reported using alternative methodologies approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The sampled data elements varied, including payments, medical claims, and tax returns. The age of the data used to develop fiscal year 2017 improper payment estimates also varied, ranging from calendar year 2013 to fiscal year 2017. Identification of improper payments. Some of the six agencies reported using processes designed specifically to estimate improper payments, whereas others reported leveraging existing reviews. These agencies' policies and procedures include a review of aspects of eligibility, except for those related to the Department of Defense's (DOD) Military Pay and the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) Retirement overpayments. DOD and OPM have not fully assessed whether their estimation processes effectively consider key program risks. OMB guidance does not specifically address how agencies are to test to identify improper payments, such as using a risk-based approach to help ensure that key risks of improper payments are addressed. The six agencies also varied in the treatment of insufficient documentation, both in identifying and in reporting the root causes of improper payments. For the agencies that contact entities outside the agency to estimate improper payments, the treatment of nonresponse differed, with one agency including nonresponses as improper payments and another generally excluding the nonresponse cases from review. Although OMB guidance states that agencies should treat cases of insufficient documentation as improper payments, it does not specifically address the treatment of nonresponse cases. Calculation of the improper payment estimate. The six agencies generally reported using law and OMB guidance to calculate improper payment estimates for the selected programs, except for the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) removed overpayments that were recovered when developing its estimate. OMB guidance requires agencies to include recovered amounts in their estimates. Removing these overpayments understates the EITC improper payment estimate and may limit IRS's ability to develop corrective actions to prevent improper payments. GAO recommends that OMB develop guidance on treatment of nonresponse cases and testing to identify improper payments, that DOD and OPM assess their estimation processes, and that IRS revise its methodology to not exclude recovered payments from its estimate. All of the agencies either agreed or partially agreed with the specific recommendations to them. GAO believes that the actions are warranted, as discussed in the report."], "length": 27486}

User fees are defined as fees collected from businesses and households for specific services or benefits provided by the government. The passage outlines the different types of user fees, such as those for business-like activities, regulatory or judicial activities, and intragovernmental transactions. It highlights that user fees can be advantageous as they are voluntary, connect the burden of financing activities to those who benefit from them, and can help decentralize decision-making. However, user fees can also be subject to economic fluctuations and may bypass regular congressional scrutiny. The passage also mentions that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provide definitions and guidelines for user fees, and that the federal government's budgetary treatment of user fees can be complex. Additionally, the passage notes that the structure and administration of federal inspection and regulation play a central role in enhancing efficiency and minimizing burdens relative to benefits enjoyed. The passage concludes by emphasizing that the use of user fees can tie the costs of supporting specific federal operations with those who benefit from them, but that the case for using general revenues may be stronger for inherently governmental responsibilities. The evidence presented includes data on the amount of user fees collected in FY2017 and the various agencies that rely on user fees for funding. The passage also discusses the challenges and considerations involved in the use of user fees, such as the potential for economic distortions and the need for careful administration to ensure efficiency and equity.

The passage also notes that the use of user fees can be subject to political considerations and that Congress can play a role in shaping the use of user fees through legislative and budgetary actions. The passage concludes by emphasizing the importance of transparency and accountability in the use", "answers": ["The federal government collects various fees from businesses and households. Choosing to raise public funds via user fees, as opposed to other means such as taxes, has important administrative and economic consequences. Many fees stem from \"business-like activities,\" in which the government provides a service or benefit in return for payment. For example, many national parks charge entry fees, which then help fund maintenance projects. Such fees and charges that result from voluntary choices, such as entering a national park, are distinguished from taxes—which stem from the government's sovereign power to compel payments. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) defines a user fee as a \"fee assessed to users for goods or services provided by the federal government. User fees generally apply to federal programs or activities that provide special benefits to identifiable recipients above and beyond what is normally available to the public.\" User fees and charges have several advantages as a means of financing public activities. They are voluntary, they connect the burden of financing activities to those who directly benefit from them, and can help decentralize decisionmaking by bypassing centralized allocation of resources. Some have expressed concerns that user fee arrangements may bypass regular congressional scrutiny and dilute Congress's power of the purse. Collections of fees and charges may also be more sensitive to economic fluctuations, which could complicate financing of programs dependent on those revenue streams. Many user fees or charges are classified as offsetting collections, which are deposited into expenditure accounts. Offsetting collections can be used to offset agency spending and typically require no further congressional approval to use. Other fees and charges are classified as offsetting receipts, which are collected into revenue accounts and typically require congressional authorization to be spent. User fees and charges can be classified as discretionary or mandatory spending, depending on how they are legally authorized. The levels and administration of some fees are specified in detailed statutory text, while other fees are created under broader agency authorities. Certain agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), have increased their reliance on user fees in past decades. Some critics have raised concerns that increased reliance on user fees could shift incentives facing those agencies. Some legislative proposals, such as H.R. 850 introduced in the 115th Congress, would limit or eliminate most exceptions and require most fees and charges to be deposited in the U.S. Treasury General Fund. Congress could fund agencies and activities now funded in whole or in part via user fees directly through the annual appropriations process. Such proposals would mark a departure from past practice. Statutory text governing many fees has evolved over many years and involves substantive policy decisions, often related to the industry or programmatic concerns. A general change in funding from user fees and charges to annual appropriations would likely shift the division of responsibilities between authorizing committees and appropriations committees. Congress may also enhance its oversight of agencies reliant on user fees by requiring more timely and detailed financial reports as well as more precise and systematic explanations of linkages between those fees and associated programs. Congress could also ask for greater transparency in fiscal data. While the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the U.S. Treasury Bureau of the Fiscal Service provide extensive data on user fees and charges, it is difficult to conduct governmentwide analyses using publicly available sources. Congress could mandate more detailed and more easily accessed data on user fees and charges. Additional funding may be needed to develop the capacity to issue those data."], "length": 26314}

{"pred": " \n\nThe GPRA Modernization Act (GPRAMA) of 2010 aims to enhance the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) by addressing longstanding performance and management issues in the federal government. GPRAMA introduces several tools and requirements to improve government performance, including cross-agency priority (CAP) goals, agency priority goals (APGs), and data-driven reviews. These tools are intended to foster collaboration and accountability across agencies. The act also requires agencies to develop strategic plans, performance plans, and annual performance reports, and to identify and resolve major management challenges. The implementation of GPRAMA has yielded mixed results, with some progress made in addressing crosscutting issues and enhancing the use of performance information, but challenges remain in fully implementing the act's provisions. Key areas for improvement include the development of a comprehensive federal program inventory, ensuring the transparency and accessibility of performance information, and expanding the use of data-driven performance reviews to cover more agency-wide performance goals and lower organizational levels. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and agencies have made some progress in implementing GPRAMA, but many recommendations remain unaddressed, particularly those related to long-standing or complex challenges. The survey of federal managers indicates that while there has been some improvement in the use of performance information, there is still room for enhancement, and agencies need to better align daily operations with results. The report concludes with four recommendations for OMB to improve the implementation of GPRAMA and address key governance challenges. Key evidence includes the mixed results of GPRAMA implementation, the survey data on the use of performance information, and the ongoing challenges in developing a comprehensive federal program inventory.

Recommendations focus on improving", "answers": ["Full implementation of GPRAMA could facilitate efforts to reform the federal government and make it more effective. GPRAMA includes a provision for GAO to review the act's implementation. This report assesses how GPRAMA implementation has affected the federal government's progress in resolving key governance challenges in (1) addressing cross-cutting issues, (2) ensuring performance information is useful and used, (3) aligning daily operations with results, and (4) building a more transparent and open government. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed statutory requirements, OMB guidance, and GAO's recent work related to GPRAMA implementation and the key governance challenges. GAO also interviewed OMB staff and surveyed a stratified random sample of 4,395 federal managers from 24 agencies on various performance and management topics. With a 67 percent response rate, the survey results are generalizable to the government-wide population of managers. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and agencies have made some progress in more fully implementing the GPRA Modernization Act (GPRAMA), but GAO's work and 2017 survey of federal managers highlight numerous areas where improvements are needed. Cross-cutting issues: Various GPRAMA provisions are aimed at addressing cross-cutting issues, such as cross-agency and agency priority goals and related data-driven reviews of progress towards those goals. To ensure alignment with the current administration's priorities, OMB's 2017 guidance removed the priority status of those goals, which stopped quarterly data-driven reviews and related public progress reports until new goals are published. OMB plans to resume implementation of these provisions in February 2018. GPRAMA also requires OMB and agencies to implement an inventory of federal programs, which could help decision makers better identify and manage fragmentation, overlap, and duplication. OMB and agencies implemented the inventory once, in May 2013. In October 2014, GAO found several issues limited the usefulness of that inventory. Since then, OMB has postponed updating the inventory, citing among other reasons the passage of subsequent laws. OMB has yet to develop a systematic approach for resuming implementation of the inventory and specific time frames for doing so. A systematic approach to developing the inventory could help ensure it provides useful information for decision makers and the public. Performance information: Survey results show federal managers generally reported no improvements in their use of performance information in decision making for various management activities, or practices that can enhance such use, since GAO's 2013 survey. For example, the use of performance information to streamline programs to reduce duplicative activities (an estimated 33 percent in 2017) is statistically significantly lower relative to 2013 (44 percent). In contrast, managers who were familiar with and whose programs were subject to quarterly data-driven reviews reported that those reviews were used to make progress toward agency priority goals. Identifying and sharing practices to expand the use of such reviews—for other performance goals and at lower levels within agencies—could lead to increased use of performance information. Daily operations: Agencies have made progress in developing results-oriented cultures but need to take additional actions. GAO's past work found that high-performing organizations use performance management systems to help individuals connect their daily activities to organizational goals. In 2017, about half of federal managers reported using performance information when setting expectations with employees (no change from GAO's last survey in 2013). Transparent and open government: GAO's past work identified a number of needed improvements to Performance.gov, the central government-wide website required by GPRAMA. The site is to provide quarterly updates on priority goals in effect through September 2017, but those updates stopped in December 2016. According to OMB, the existing information for cross-agency priority goals is the final update, and agencies should publish final updates on their priority goals in annual performance reports. Performance.gov does not provide users with this information, thereby limiting the transparency and accessibility of those results. In addition to following through on plans to resume implementation of key GPRAMA provisions, GAO recommends that OMB (1) consider a systematic approach to developing the program inventory, (2) revise guidance to provide specific time frames for inventory implementation, (3) identify and share practices for expanding the use of data-driven reviews, and (4) update Performance.gov to explain that reporting on priority goals was suspended and provide the location of final progress updates.

This initiative has been funded using OCO appropriations, which Congress provides in addition to DOD's base budget appropriations. The Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying the Continuing Appropriations and Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017, included a provision for GAO to review matters related to ERI. In this report, we (1) describe changes in ERI's objectives, funding under ERI, and DOD's posture in Europe since 2014 and (2) evaluate the extent to which DOD's planning processes for posture initiatives funded under ERI prioritize those initiatives, estimate their long-term costs, and communicate their estimated costs to Congress. GAO analyzed DOD strategy documentation, budget and cost analysis guidance, budget justification materials, and cost and obligations data. GAO also interviewed knowledgeable officials within the Office of the Secretary of Defense, U.S. European Command, the military services, and the State Department. Since 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) has expanded the European Reassurance Initiative's (ERI) objectives, increased its funding, and planned enhancements to European posture. DOD expanded ERI's objectives from the short-term reassurance of allies and partners to include deterring Russian aggression in the long term and developing the capacity to field a credible combined force should deterrence fail. With respect to funding, DOD will have requested approximately $4.5 billion for ERI's posture enhancements through the end of fiscal year 2017 (about $3.2 billion for fiscal year 2017 alone), and in July 2016 EUCOM identified funding needs for future posture initiatives. The expansion of ERI's objectives has contributed to DOD's enhancing its posture in Europe. Specifically, DOD has increased the size and duration of Army combat unit deployments, planned to preposition Army equipment in Eastern Europe, added new enduring locations (e.g., locations that DOD expects to access and use to support U.S. security interests for the foreseeable future), improved infrastructure, and negotiated new agreements with European nations. As of April 2017, DOD was considering further force enhancements under ERI as part of the department's ERI budget request. DOD also was reviewing whether new enduring locations to support ERI were needed and was considering other improvements to existing infrastructure. DOD's process for planning ERI has not established priorities among posture initiatives funded under ERI relative to those in its base budget, nor estimated long-term sustainment costs for some posture initiatives funded under ERI, nor communicated future costs to Congress. ERI is being planned using a separate process from DOD's established processes and is funded from DOD's overseas contingency operations (OCO) appropriations. GAO found several weaknesses: Lack of prioritization : DOD establishes priorities among ERI posture initiatives but has not evaluated them against base budget initiatives using its posture management process. As a result, DOD lacks an understanding of the relative importance of ERI initiatives and may be investing in projects that it will not continue should OCO funding become unavailable. Lack of sustainment costs : EUCOM and the military services have not fully estimated the long-term costs to sustain equipment and construction funded under ERI. Based on DOD's approach for calculating rough order sustainment costs, GAO determined that these costs could be substantial. DOD officials said that GAO correctly applied DOD's approach for estimating sustainment costs, but noted that actual costs may be lower, because the military services may not fully fund sustainment. In the absence of comprehensive estimates, DOD has been limited in its ability to assess affordability and plan for future costs. Not communicating future costs : DOD limits Congress's visibility into the resources needed to implement ERI and achieve its objectives because it does not include future costs in its ERI budget request. This is a public version of a classified report issued in August 2017. Information on specific posture planning, guidance, and budget estimates that DOD deemed to be classified have been omitted from this report.

A joint resolution of disapproval will become effective once both houses of Congress pass a joint resolution and it is signed by the President, or if Congress overrides the President's veto. The CRA generally adopts a broad definition of the word \"rule\" from the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), defining a rule as \"the whole or a part of an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy or describing the organization, procedure, or practice requirements of an agency.\" The CRA, however, provides three exceptions to this broad definition: any rule of particular applicability, including a rule that approves or prescribes for the future rates, wages, prices, services, or allowances therefor, corporate or financial structures, reorganizations, mergers, or acquisitions thereof, or accounting practices or disclosures bearing on any of the foregoing; any rule relating to agency management or personnel; or any rule of agency organization, procedure, or practice that does not substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency parties. The class of rules the CRA covers is broader than the category of rules that are subject to the APA's notice-and-comment requirements. As such, some agency actions, such as guidance documents, that are not subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures may still be considered rules under the CRA and thus could be overturned using the CRA's procedures. The effect of Congress disapproving a rule that is not subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking may be subject to debate, given that such rules are generally viewed to lack any legal effect in the first place. Nonetheless, the CRA does encompass some such rules, as highlighted by the recent enactment of a CRA resolution overturning a bulletin from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that was not subject to the notice-and-comment procedures. Even if an agency action falls under the CRA's definition of \"rule,\" however, the expedited procedures for considering legislation to overturn the rule only become available when the agency submits the rule to Congress. In many cases in which agencies take actions that fall under the scope of a \"rule\" but have not gone through notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures, agencies fail to submit those rules. Thus, questions have arisen as to how Members can avail themselves of the CRA's special fast-track procedures if the agency has not submitted the action to Congress. To protect its prerogative to review agency rules under the CRA, Congress and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) have developed an ad hoc process in which Members can request that GAO provide a formal legal opinion on whether a particular agency action qualifies as a rule under the CRA. If GAO concludes that the action in question falls within the CRA's definition of \"rule,\" Congress has treated the publication of the GAO opinion in the Congressional Record as constructive submission of the rule.

The summary focuses on the critical aspects of the document without unnecessary details.", "answers": ["The number of vehicles affected by safety defect recalls increased sharply in recent years—from nearly 13 million in 2011 to over 51 million in 2016. Once a defect is identified, auto manufacturers are required to send written notification to vehicle owners by mail. NHTSA also aims to enhance awareness of auto recalls by providing information on its website, NHTSA.gov . The Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act includes a provision requiring GAO to study the use of publicly available safety recall information. This report addresses: (1) how consumers and industry stakeholders use such information and (2) how easy to use do consumers find the auto recall areas of NHTSA.gov, among other objectives. To understand consumers' use of auto recall information and to test website usability, GAO conducted 12 focus groups with 94 consumers who had a recall. Focus groups were held in six locations selected for population and geographic variation. GAO identified key website usability practices and requested an evaluation by website usability professionals. GAO reviewed statutes, regulations, and NHTSA documents, and interviewed industry stakeholders—including 10 manufacturers selected based on sales market share and other factors. Consumers, manufacturers, and auto dealers use publicly available auto recall information differently. For example, the 94 consumers in 12 focus groups that GAO conducted used this information to decide whether to repair their vehicles. These consumers overwhelmingly cited safety risk and convenience as the two most influential factors they considered. Most consumers reported a preference for receiving recall notification by at least one electronic means, such as by e-mail or text message, in addition to mail. However, only 7 of 94 consumers reported receiving electronic notifications, suggesting a gap between the industry's auto recall notification practices and consumers' preferences. (See fig.). In response to a mandate in law, in September 2016, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) issued a proposed rule that, if finalized, would require manufacturers to notify consumers about auto recalls by electronic means in addition to mail. Most consumers in GAO's focus group website usability tests found the auto recall areas of NHTSA's website—NHTSA.gov—easy to use; however, some consumers experienced difficulties when asked to complete auto recall related tasks. For example, when consumers attempted to search for recalls affecting their specific vehicles, some found the search results confusing, leading them to question the accuracy of the results. Similarly, some consumers were hampered in searching for recalls by their vehicles' year, make, and model because the website did not always display model options using plain language. GAO found that the auto recall areas of NHTSA.gov do not always reflect federal and industry key website usability practices, and that an independent evaluation conducted by website usability professionals at GAO's request identified similar issues. NHTSA is in the process of consolidating its websites and plans to conduct a website usability study of NHTSA.gov with consumers after the consolidation is complete. However, the agency has not determined a completion date for the consolidation effort—an essential step for organizations to effectively guide their information technology efforts. Without establishing a completion date and taking interim steps to improve the usability of NHTSA.gov, consumers will likely continue to experience difficulties, which may limit the effectiveness of the website's primary means of providing consumers with information about recalls affecting their vehicles. GAO recommends that NHTSA determine a completion date for its website consolidation effort and take interim steps to improve the usability of NHTSA.gov by addressing the website usability difficulties GAO identified. The Department of Transportation concurred with the recommendations."], "length": 26512}

The CDC, an operating division of the Department of Health and Human Services, is responsible for disease prevention and control, environmental health, and promoting public health. Despite having an information security program, the CDC faced numerous deficiencies in its technical controls and agency-wide information security program. Key findings include:\n\n1. **Technical Controls Deficiencies**: The CDC had not consistently implemented strong access controls, encryption, timely patching, and secure configuration settings. For example, the agency had not effectively implemented encryption controls, and had not consistently configured devices securely or applied patches in a timely manner.\n\n2. **Information Security Program Shortcomings**: The CDC’s program had shortcomings in addressing threats, documenting detailed technical requirements, monitoring configuration settings, and comprehensively assessing remediated deficiencies. The agency had not consistently or effectively addressed these issues, leading to increased risks.\n\n3. **Risk Assessments and Plans**: The CDC had conducted risk assessments and developed security plans, but these were not always thorough or up-to-date. The agency had not effectively assessed the risk of having alternate processing sites within close proximity to each other, nor had it documented its cost analysis and associated risk.\n\n4. **Progress and Recommendations**: Since the issuance of the June 2018 report, the CDC has made significant progress in implementing the recommendations to resolve technical control deficiencies and improve its information security program. However, the agency still needs to fully implement the remaining recommendations to mitigate risks effectively.\n\nThe report concludes that the CDC must continue to address these shortcomings to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its information systems. The Navy's submarine maintenance delays and idle time are not directly related to the CDC's cybersecurity issues and are discussed in a separate passage. The submarine maintenance challenges are due to workforce shortages, facility conditions, and other logistical issues, which are not pertinent to the CDC's cybersecurity findings.

Accordingly, effective information security controls are essential to ensure that the agency's systems and information are protected from misuse and modification. GAO was asked to examine information security at CDC. In June 2018, GAO issued a limited official use only report on the extent to which CDC had effectively implemented technical controls and an information security program to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its information on selected information systems. This current report is a public version of the June 2018 report. In addition, for this public report, GAO determined the extent to which CDC has taken corrective actions to address the previously identified security program and technical control deficiencies and related recommendations for improvement. For this report, GAO reviewed supporting documents regarding CDC's actions on previously identified recommendations and interviewed personnel at CDC. As GAO reported in June 2018, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) implemented technical controls and an information security program that were intended to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its information systems and information. However, GAO identified control and program deficiencies in the core security functions related to identifying risk, protecting systems from threats and vulnerabilities, detecting and responding to cyber security events, and recovering system operations (see table below). GAO made 195 recommendations to address these deficiencies. As of August 2018, CDC had made significant progress in resolving many of the security deficiencies by implementing 102 of 184 (about 55 percent) technical control recommendations, and partially implementing 1 of 11 information security program recommendations made in the June 2018 report. The figure shows the status of CDC's efforts to implement the 195 recommendations. Additionally, CDC has created remedial action plans to implement the majority of the remaining open recommendations by September 2019.

GAO was asked to review federal agencies' management of heavy equipment. This report, among other objectives, examines: (1) the number, type, and costs of heavy equipment items that are owned by 20 federal agencies and (2) the heavy equipment that selected agencies recently acquired as well as how they decided whether to purchase or lease this equipment. GAO collected heavy equipment inventory data as of June 2017 from the 24 agencies that have chief financial officers responsible for overseeing financial management. GAO also selected three agencies (using factors such as the heavy equipment fleet's size) and reviewed their acquisitions of and guidance on heavy equipment. These agencies' practices are not generalizable to all acquisitions but provide insight into what efforts these agencies take to acquire thousands of heavy equipment items. GAO also interviewed officials at the three selected agencies. Of the 24 agencies GAO reviewed, 20 reported owning over 136,000 heavy equipment items such as cranes, backhoes, and forklifts, and spending over $7.4 billion (in 2016 dollars) to acquire this equipment. The remaining 4 agencies reported that they do not own any heavy equipment. The three selected agencies GAO reviewed in-depth—the Air Force within the Department of Defense (DOD), and the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service within the Department of the Interior (Interior)—spent about $360 million to purchase about 3,500 heavy equipment assets in calendar years 2012 through 2016 and over $5 million to lease heavy equipment from fiscal years 2012 through 2016. Officials from all three agencies stated that they consider mission needs and the availability of equipment leases when deciding whether to lease or purchase heavy equipment. Federal regulations provide that agencies should consider whether it is more economical to lease or purchase equipment when acquiring heavy equipment, and federal internal control standards require that management clearly document all transactions in a manner that allows the documentation to be readily available for examination. However, in reviewing selected leases and purchases of heavy equipment from these three agencies, GAO found that officials did not consistently conduct or document lease-versus-purchase analyses. Officials at the Air Force and Interior said that there was a lack of clarity in agency policies about when they were required to conduct and document such analyses.

Key issues include incomplete data on commercial fishing vessel incidents, unrealistic asset performance data, and limitations in performance goal data. The Coast Guard is working to improve data collection and transparency, but progress remains slow. Additionally, the Coast Guard is facing affordability challenges in modernizing its assets, particularly with the acquisition of new vessels like the National Security Cutter and Fast Response Cutter. The Coast Guard is developing long-term plans to address these challenges, but the timelines and details of these plans are uncertain. The Coast Guard's efforts to improve data accuracy and transparency are crucial for effective program management and mission success. The Coast Guard is also working on a 20-year plan to identify necessary recapitalization efforts and fiscal resources required to maintain current service levels. However, the timeline and content of this plan are not yet finalized.

To ensure that the Coast Guard is effectively fulfilling its missions, agency managers must have accurate information and base decisions on sound analyses for effective program management. This statement discusses Coast Guard actions needed to (1) improve the quality of data used for program management and (2) improve the transparency of its data for reporting on mission performance and planning. This statement is based on relevant products GAO issued from June 2014 through December 2017 on Coast Guard strategic planning and management issues, as well as related recommendation follow-up conducted through February 2018. GAO reviewed applicable laws, regulations, policies and guidance. GAO also interviewed Coast Guard officials responsible for administering these programs and obtained information on how they used data to inform decisionmaking. GAO interviewed a range of stakeholders, including federal and industry officials. GAO's prior work recommended multiple actions to improve the Coast Guard's program management by improving the quality of data it uses to manage and report on its mission performance. Specifically, GAO recommended actions such as collecting more complete data and clarifying the data limitations to facilitate more effective program management. For example, in December 2017, GAO found that more information is needed to calculate vessel safety statistics that could enhance the Coast Guard's knowledge about accident, injury, and fatality trends involving commercial fishing vessels. Having more complete information could be useful to carrying out its marine safety mission, and GAO recommended, among other things, that the Coast Guard ensure that data collected during commercial fishing vessel incident investigations is accurately captured. In 2018, the Coast Guard reported taking initial steps to capture more accurate data. GAO's prior work also identified areas where the Coast Guard could improve the transparency of the data it uses for reporting on its mission performance as well its capital planning purposes. For example, in an October 2017 report on performance goals, GAO found the Coast Guard's Annual Performance Report (APR) has not been released publicly since 2011. Consequently, there has not been full visibility over performance across all of the Coast Guard's missions. Coast Guard officials stated that a decision by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) leadership to limit the number of performance goals shared publicly had deterred the Coast Guard from public release of its APR. GAO recommended that APRs be available on the Coast Guard's website; the Coast Guard plans to publicly release future APRs. In addition, previous GAO reports found that the Coast Guard's annual 5-year capital investment plan, which projects acquisition funding needs for the upcoming 5 years, did not consistently reflect current total cost estimates or the effects of tradeoffs made as part of the annual budget cycle. GAO made recommendations to help the Coast Guard plan for future acquisitions and the difficult trade off decisions it will face given funding constraints. The Coast Guard agreed, but it is unclear when it will complete the 20-year plan.

NCA has faced challenges in implementing its plan to increase veterans' access to burial options, including difficulties in acquiring suitable land, estimating costs, and using all available data to target unserved veteran populations. As of September 2019, NCA has opened only four of the 18 planned new national cemeteries, falling significantly behind its original schedule. Key challenges include the urban initiative site in Chicago, which has experienced multiple delays due to land acquisition issues, and the rural initiative site in Elko, Nevada, which requires legislative action to transfer land ownership. NCA's cost estimates for rural initiative sites have increased significantly, and its cost-estimating guidance does not fully incorporate best practices for reliable cost estimates. Additionally, NCA's Grants Program, which funds state and tribal government veterans' cemeteries, relies on incomplete data and lacks oversight, potentially leading to inefficient use of resources. The report recommends that NCA revise its cost-estimating procedures to better align with best practices and strengthen oversight of the Grants Program to ensure that unserved veteran populations receive adequate burial options. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs should ensure that NCA updates its cost-estimating procedures to fully incorporate the 12 steps identified in the GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide. The report also suggests that NCA use census tract data to estimate served and unserved veteran populations, which could provide more precise information and help inform its plans for providing reasonable access to burial options. The findings highlight the importance of accurate data and robust oversight in achieving NCA's mission to serve and honor veterans and their families.

Within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) has a plan to establish 18 new national cemeteries to increase reasonable access to burial options for veterans. NCA defines reasonable access as a national or state veterans' cemetery being located within 75 miles of veterans' homes. Key parts of NCA's plan include establishing 13 urban and rural initiative national cemeteries and awarding grant funds to state applicants for establishing new state veterans' cemeteries. NCA has made limited progress in implementing its plan to increase burial access and is years behind its original schedule for opening new cemeteries. For example, NCA has opened only two of its planned urban and rural initiative sites and is behind its original schedule for the other 11 (see fig. below). The primary factor delaying NCA's completion of these cemeteries has been challenges in acquiring suitable land. NCA has also been challenged in producing accurate estimates of construction costs for most of its rural initiative sites. Cost estimates have increased more than 200 percent (from about $7 million to $24 million) for these sites, and NCA's guidance for developing cost estimates for the cemeteries does not fully incorporate the 12 steps identified in cost-estimating leading practices—such as conducting a risk and uncertainty analysis or a sensitivity analysis. As a result, NCA is not well positioned to provide reliable and valid cost estimates to better inform decisions to enhance veterans' cemetery access.

To ensure that the Coast Guard is effectively fulfilling its missions, agency managers must have accurate information and base decisions on sound analyses for effective program management. This statement discusses Coast Guard actions needed to (1) improve the quality of data used for program management and (2) improve the transparency of its data for reporting on mission performance and planning. This statement is based on relevant products GAO issued from June 2014 through December 2017 on Coast Guard strategic planning and management issues, as well as related recommendation follow-up conducted through February 2018. GAO reviewed applicable laws, regulations, policies and guidance. GAO also interviewed Coast Guard officials responsible for administering these programs and obtained information on how they used data to inform decisionmaking. GAO interviewed a range of stakeholders, including federal and industry officials. GAO's prior work recommended multiple actions to improve the Coast Guard's program management by improving the quality of data it uses to manage and report on its mission performance. Specifically, GAO recommended actions such as collecting more complete data and clarifying the data limitations to facilitate more effective program management. For example, in December 2017, GAO found that more information is needed to calculate vessel safety statistics that could enhance the Coast Guard's knowledge about accident, injury, and fatality trends involving commercial fishing vessels. Having more complete information could be useful to carrying out its marine safety mission, and GAO recommended, among other things, that the Coast Guard ensure that data collected during commercial fishing vessel incident investigations is accurately captured. In 2018, the Coast Guard reported taking initial steps to capture more accurate data. GAO's prior work also identified areas where the Coast Guard could improve the transparency of the data it uses for reporting on its mission performance as well its capital planning purposes. For example, in an October 2017 report on performance goals, GAO found the Coast Guard's Annual Performance Report (APR) has not been released publicly since 2011. Consequently, there has not been full visibility over performance across all of the Coast Guard's missions. Coast Guard officials stated that a decision by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) leadership to limit the number of performance goals shared publicly had deterred the Coast Guard from public release of its APR. GAO recommended that APRs be available on the Coast Guard's website; the Coast Guard plans to publicly release future APRs. In addition, previous GAO reports found that the Coast Guard's annual 5-year capital investment plan, which projects acquisition funding needs for the upcoming 5 years, did not consistently reflect current total cost estimates or the effects of tradeoffs made as part of the annual budget cycle.

{"pred": " \n\nPassage 1 discusses the national pipeline system, which consists of over 2.7 million miles of pipelines transporting oil, natural gas, and other hazardous liquids. These pipelines are primarily buried underground and run through both remote and densely populated areas. The system includes three main types: hazardous liquid pipelines, natural gas transmission and storage pipelines, and natural gas distribution pipelines. Over 3,000 pipeline companies operate these networks, which can span multiple states and border regions. The pipeline sector is generally considered resilient, with operators able to quickly respond to incidents and maintain service. However, the system faces vulnerabilities from both physical and cyber threats. Physical threats include attacks by terrorists, environmental activists, and lone actors, while cyber threats involve hacking and infiltration of operational systems. The National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) outlines a risk management framework for critical infrastructure protection, which includes pipeline systems. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) plays a key role in pipeline security, conducting Corporate Security Reviews (CSRs) and Critical Facility Security Reviews (CFSRs) to assess pipeline vulnerabilities and compliance with TSA guidelines. Despite these efforts, challenges persist, including staffing shortages, unclear criteria for identifying critical facilities, and the need for more robust risk assessments. TSA has revised its Pipeline Security Guidelines to reflect the evolving threat environment and incorporate cybersecurity principles from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework. However, without a documented process for regularly reviewing and updating these guidelines, TSA cannot ensure they remain current. Additionally, the criteria for determining critical facilities are not clearly defined, leading to inconsistencies in how facilities are categorized. TSA has established a pipeline risk assessment to rank the relative risk of the top 100 critical pipeline systems, but this assessment has not been updated since 2014 and lacks comprehensive data and methodologies. The report concludes with 10 recommendations to improve TSA's pipeline security program, including developing a strategic workforce plan, updating the risk assessment, and ensuring the pipeline security program has a suite of performance measures that exhibit key attributes of successful performance measures. The recommendations aim to enhance the security and resilience of the nation's pipeline systems. Key evidence supporting these points includes data on the number of pipeline companies, types of pipelines, and the frequency and scale of cyber incidents in the energy sector. Unique or innovative points include the emphasis on the need for a documented process for regularly reviewing and updating TSA's Pipeline Security Guidelines and the call for an independent, external peer review of the pipeline risk assessment methodology. The report highlights the dynamic and evolving", "answers": ["More than 2.7 million miles of pipeline transport and distribute oil, natural gas, and other hazardous products throughout the United States. Interstate pipelines run through remote areas and highly populated urban areas, and are vulnerable to accidents, operating errors, and malicious physical and cyber-based attack or intrusion. The energy sector accounted for 35 percent of the 796 critical infrastructure cyber incidents reported to DHS from 2013 to 2015. Several federal and private entities have roles in pipeline security. TSA is primarily responsible for the oversight of pipeline physical security and cybersecurity. GAO was asked to review TSA's efforts to assess and enhance pipeline security and cybersecurity. This report examines, among other objectives: (1) the guidance pipeline operators reported using to address security risks and the extent that TSA ensures its guidelines reflect the current threat environment; (2) the extent that TSA has assessed pipeline systems' security risks; and (3) the extent TSA has assessed its effectiveness in reducing pipeline security risks. GAO analyzed TSA documents, such as its Pipeline Security Guidelines ; evaluated TSA pipeline risk assessment efforts; and interviewed TSA officials, 10 U.S. pipeline operators—selected based on volume, geography, and material transported—and representatives from five industry associations. Pipeline operators reported using a range of guidelines and standards to address physical and cybersecurity risks, including the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) Pipeline Security Guidelines , initially issued in 2011. TSA issued revised guidelines in March 2018 to reflect changes in the threat environment and incorporate most of the principles and practices from the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity . However, TSA's revisions do not include all elements of the current framework and TSA does not have a documented process for reviewing and revising its guidelines on a regular basis. Without such a documented process, TSA cannot ensure that its guidelines reflect the latest known standards and best practices for physical security and cybersecurity, or address the dynamic security threat environment that pipelines face. Further, GAO found that the guidelines lack clear definitions to ensure that pipeline operators identify their critical facilities. GAO's analysis showed that operators of at least 34 of the nation's top 100 critical pipeline systems (determined by volume of product transported) deemed highest risk had identified no critical facilities. This may be due, in part, to the guidelines not clearly defining the criteria to determine facilities' criticality. To assess pipeline security risks, TSA conducts pipeline security reviews—Corporate Security Reviews and Critical Facility Security Reviews—to assess pipeline systems' vulnerabilities. However, GAO found that the number of TSA security reviews has varied considerably over the last several years, as shown in the table on the following page. TSA officials stated that staffing limitations have prevented TSA from conducting more reviews. Staffing levels for TSA's Pipeline Security Branch have varied significantly since fiscal year 2010 with the number of staff ranging from 14 full-time equivalents in fiscal years 2012 and 2013 to 1 in 2014. Further, TSA does not have a strategic workforce plan to help ensure it identifies the skills and competencies—such as the required level of cybersecurity expertise—necessary to carry out its pipeline security responsibilities. By establishing a strategic workforce plan, TSA can help ensure that it has identified the necessary skills, competencies, and staffing. GAO also identified factors that likely limit the usefulness of TSA's risk assessment methodology for prioritizing pipeline system reviews. Specifically, TSA has not updated its risk assessment methodology since 2014 to reflect current threats to the pipeline industry. Further, its sources of data and underlying assumptions and judgments regarding certain threat and vulnerability inputs are not fully documented. In addition, the risk assessment has not been peer reviewed since its inception in 2007. Taking steps to strengthen its risk assessment, and initiating an independent, external peer review would provide greater assurance that TSA ranks relative risk among pipeline systems using comprehensive and accurate data and methods. TSA has established performance measures to monitor pipeline security review recommendations, analyze their results, and assess effectiveness in reducing risks. However, these measures do not possess key attributes—such as clarity, and having measurable targets—that GAO has found are key to successful performance measures. By taking steps to ensure that its pipeline security program performance measures exhibit these key attributes, TSA could better assess its effectiveness at reducing pipeline systems' security risks. Pipeline Security Branch officials also reported conducting security reviews as the primary means for assessing the effectiveness of TSA's efforts to reduce pipeline security risks. However, TSA has not tracked the status of Corporate Security Review recommendations for the past 5 years. Until TSA monitors and records the status of these reviews' recommendations, it will be hindered in its efforts to determine whether its recommendations are leading to significant reduction in risk. GAO makes 10 recommendations to TSA to improve its pipeline security program management (many are listed on the next page), and DHS concurred. GAO recommends, among other things, that the TSA Administrator take the following actions: implement a documented process for reviewing, and if deemed necessary, for revising TSA's Pipeline Security Guidelines at defined intervals; clarify TSA's Pipeline Security Guidelines by defining key terms within its criteria for determining critical facilities; develop a strategic workforce plan for TSA's Security Policy and Industry Engagement‘s Surface Division; update TSA's pipeline risk assessment methodology to include current data to ensure it reflects industry conditions and threats; fully document the data sources, underlying assumptions and judgments that form the basis of TSA's pipeline risk assessment methodology; take steps to coordinate an independent, external peer review of TSA's pipeline risk assessment methodology; ensure the Security Policy and Industry Engagement‘s Surface Division has a suite of performance measures which exhibit key attributes of successful performance measures; and enter information on Corporate Security Review recommendations and monitor and record their status."], "length": 26575}

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (VAMC) officials are responsible for reviewing the clinical care delivered by their privileged providers—physicians and dentists who are approved to independently perform specific services—after concerns are raised. The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care. For example, GAO found that after one VAMC failed to report to the NPDB or SLBs a provider who resigned to avoid an adverse privileging action, a non-VA hospital in the same city took an adverse privileging action against that same provider for the same reason 2 years later."], "length": 28454}

In fiscal years 2015 and 2016, USAID obligated approximately $544.1 million and expended about $350.6 million of the allocated funds. The assistance is directed towards various development objectives such as economic growth, investing in the next generation, and governance and civic engagement. Key projects include the Architecture and Engineering Services project, which focuses on infrastructure rehabilitation and construction, and the World Food Program grant, which ensures food security for vulnerable populations. USAID ensures that assistance does not inadvertently support entities or individuals associated with terrorism by vetting PA creditors and conducting external assessments of the PA's financial systems. In fiscal years 2015 and 2016, USAID made direct payments to PA creditors totaling about $145 million, including payments to two Israeli fuel companies and the Bank of Palestine. USAID also commissioned external assessments of the PA Ministry of Health and Planning to ensure the integrity of the debt relief payment process. The assessments identified weaknesses in both systems, but USAID took steps to mitigate these findings. Overall, USAID's efforts demonstrate a commitment to providing assistance in a manner that aligns with legislative requirements and supports the development of a more stable and prosperous Palestinian society. USAID's compliance with legal requirements and the use of external assessments to ensure the integrity of the debt relief payment process are unique and innovative points in the management of this assistance program. The data provided by USAID, including obligations and expenditures as of March 31, 2018, and descriptions of key projects, serves as the primary evidence supporting these conclusions.

According to the Department of State, this assistance to the Palestinians promotes U.S. economic and political foreign policy interests by supporting Middle East peace negotiations and financing economic stabilization programs. USAID is primarily responsible for administering ESF assistance to the West Bank and Gaza. Appropriations acts for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 included provisions for GAO to review the treatment, handling, and uses of funds provided through the ESF for assistance to the West Bank and Gaza. This report examines (1) the status of ESF assistance and projects provided to the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016, including project assistance and payments to PA creditors, and (2) the extent to which USAID conducted required vetting of PA creditors to ensure that this assistance would not support entities or individuals associated with terrorism and assessed PA ministries' capacity to use ESF assistance as intended. GAO reviewed relevant laws and regulations and USAID financial data, policies, procedures, and documents. GAO also interviewed USAID and State Department officials. As of March 2018, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) had allocated about $545 million of funding appropriated to the Economic Support Fund (ESF) for assistance in the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016. USAID obligated about $544 million (over 99 percent) and expended about $351 million (over 64 percent) of the total allocations. Project assistance accounted for approximately $399 million of the obligated funds, while payments to Palestinian Authority (PA) creditors accounted for $145 million (see figure). USAID's obligations for project assistance in the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 supported three development objectives—Economic Growth and Infrastructure ($239 million), Investing in the Next Generation ($107 million), and Governance and Civic Engagement (about $25 million). In fiscal years 2015 and 2016, USAID made payments directly to PA creditors—two Israeli fuel companies, to cover debts for petroleum purchases, and a local Palestinian bank, to pay off a line of credit used for PA medical referrals to six hospitals in the East Jerusalem Hospital network. USAID vetted PA creditors to ensure that the program assistance would not provide support to entities or individuals associated with terrorism and also conducted external assessments and financial audits of PA ministries of Health and Finance and Planning. USAID documentation showed that, as required, officials checked the vetting status of each PA creditor within 12 months before USAID signed its debt relief grant agreements with the PA. In addition, although USAID determined that it was not legally required to assess the PA Ministry of Health's medical referral services and the Ministry of Finance and Planning's petroleum procurement system, the agency commissioned external assessments of both ministries. These assessments found some weaknesses in both ministries' systems; however, USAID mission officials stated that these weaknesses did not affect USAID debt relief payments to the PA creditors. Nevertheless, USAID took additional steps to mitigate the identified weaknesses. For example, a USAID contractor worked with the Ministry of Health to update, revise, and approve guidelines for medical referrals. In addition, USAID commissioned financial audits of the debt relief grant agreements between USAID and the PA for direct payments to PA creditors in fiscal year 2015 and 2016.

Committees play the central role in the process through investigations and hearings. Senate Rule XXXI provides that nominations shall be referred to appropriate committees \"unless otherwise ordered.\" Most nominations are referred, although a Senate standing order provides that some \"privileged\" nominations to specified positions will not be referred unless requested by a Senator. The Senate rule concerning committee jurisdictions (Rule XXV) broadly defines issue areas for committees, and the same jurisdictional statements generally apply to nominations as well as legislation. A committee often gathers information about a nominee either before or instead of a formal hearing. A committee considering a nomination has four options. It can report the nomination to the Senate favorably, unfavorably, or without recommendation, or it can choose to take no action. It is more common for a committee to take no action on a nomination than to reject a nominee outright. The Senate handles executive business, which includes both nominations and treaties, separately from its legislative business. All nominations reported from committee are listed on the Executive Calendar, a separate document from the Calendar of Business, which lists pending bills and resolutions. Generally speaking, the majority leader schedules floor consideration of nominations on the Calendar. Nominations are considered in \"executive session,\" a parliamentary form of the Senate in session that has its own journal and, to some extent, its own rules of procedure. The Senate can call up a nomination expeditiously, because a motion to enter executive session to consider a specific nomination on the Calendar is not debatable. This motion requires a majority of Senators present and voting, a quorum being present, for approval. After a nomination has been called up, the question before the Senate is \"will the Senate advise and consent to this nomination?\" A majority of Senators voting is required to approve a nomination. However, Senate rules place no limit on how long a nomination may be debated, and ending consideration could require invoking cloture. On April 6, 2017, the Senate reinterpreted Rule XXII in order to allow cloture to be invoked on nominations to the Supreme Court by a majority of Senators voting. This expanded the results of similar actions taken by the Senate in November 2013, which changed the cloture vote requirement to a majority for nominations other than to the Supreme Court. After the 2013 decision, the number of nominations subjected to a cloture process increased. On April 3, 2019, the Senate reinterpreted Rule XXII again. The Senate reduced, from 30 hours to 2 hours, the maximum time nominations can be considered after cloture has been invoked. This change applied to all executive branch nominations except to high-level positions such as heads of departments, and it applied to all judicial nominations except to the Supreme Court and the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The full impact of this change is difficult to assess at this time, but it is likely to shorten the time between a cloture vote and a vote on the nomination. If Senators respond as they did to the last reinterpretation of the cloture rule, it might also increase the number of nominations subjected to a cloture process. Nominations that are pending when the Senate adjourns sine die at the end of a session or recesses for more than 30 days are returned to the President unless the Senate, by unanimous consent, waives the rule requiring their return (Senate Rule XXXI, clause 6).

{"pred": " \n\nThe Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) is a federal program that provides free meals to children in low-income areas during the summer months. Participation in the SFSP has increased over the past decade, with 149 million meals served in fiscal year 2016. However, the current estimate of children participating in the SFSP is unreliable due to inconsistencies in how states calculate average daily attendance (ADA). Challenges in providing summer meals include limited meal site availability, particularly in rural areas, and low participation among youth and teens. To address these challenges, states and sponsors have implemented various strategies such as mobile meal delivery, partnerships with community organizations, and offering age-appropriate activities. Despite these efforts, administrative challenges like limited state agency staffing and federal funding constraints persist. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) has provided guidance and grant funding to support these efforts, but more clarity and communication are needed regarding flexibilities granted to ensure safe meal delivery. Additionally, FNS should improve its estimate of children's participation in the SFSP and evaluate the use of flexibilities granted to states and sponsors. Recommendations include enhancing ADA calculation methods, communicating clearer criteria for flexibilities, and disseminating information on administrative simplifications across child nutrition programs. These measures aim to better inform program implementation and outreach to areas with low participation. Key evidence includes trends in meal service data, state survey responses, and interviews with stakeholders. Unique points highlight the complexity of addressing summer meal challenges and the need for ongoing collaboration between federal and state entities. The SFSP plays a crucial role in providing meals to low-income children during the summer, but its effectiveness is hampered by unreliable estimates of participation, logistical challenges, and administrative hurdles. Efforts to improve the program include flexible delivery models, community partnerships, and targeted outreach, though more support and clearer guidance are needed to fully address these issues. The SFSP's reliance on state estimates of participation and the limitations of these estimates underscore the need for improved data collection and analysis methods. Addressing challenges such as limited meal site availability and low youth participation requires a multifaceted approach involving partnerships, creative solutions, and ongoing support from federal and state agencies. Improving the SFSP's administrative efficiency and ensuring safe meal delivery are critical for its success, highlighting the importance of clear communication and collaboration between stakeholders.

In the last decade, federal expenditures for SFSP have increased as the program has expanded, according to USDA data. GAO was asked to review the SFSP. This report examines (1) what is known about SFSP participation, (2) other programs that help feed low-income children over the summer, and (3) challenges, if any, in providing summer meals to children and the extent to which USDA provides assistance to address these challenges. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed USDA's SFSP data for fiscal years 2007 through 2016; surveyed state agencies responsible for administering the SFSP in 50 states and the District of Columbia; visited a nongeneralizable group of 3 states and 30 meal sites, selected based on Census data on child poverty rates and urban and rural locations; analyzed meal site data from the 3 states; and interviewed USDA, state and national organization officials, and SFSP providers, including sponsors and site operators. Nationwide, the total number of meals served to children in low-income areas through the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) increased from 113 to 149 million (about 32 percent) from fiscal year 2007 through 2016. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) directs states to use the number of meals served, along with other data, to estimate the number of children participating in the SFSP. However, participation estimates have been calculated inconsistently from state to state and year to year. In 2017, USDA took steps to improve the consistency of participation estimates, noting they are critical for informing program implementation and strategic planning. However, GAO determined that the method USDA directs states to use will continue to provide unreliable estimates of participation, hindering USDA's ability to use them for these purposes. Other federal and nonfederal programs help feed low-income children over the summer to some extent, according to states GAO surveyed and SFSP providers and others GAO interviewed. For example, in July 2016, USDA data indicate about 26 million meals were served through a separate federal program that allows school meal providers to serve summer meals. Some children also received summer meals through nonfederal programs operated by faith-based organizations and foodbanks, though GAO's state survey and interviews with providers and national organizations indicate the reach of such efforts is limited. States and SFSP providers reported challenges with meal sites, participation, and program administration; USDA has taken steps to address these areas. Specifically, in GAO's survey, a majority of states reported challenges with availability and awareness of meal sites, as well as limited program participation and administrative capacity. National, state, and local officials have taken steps to address these issues, such as increasing outreach and offering activities to attract participation. In addition, 17 states in GAO's survey and providers in the states GAO visited reported a challenge with ensuring meal sites are in safe locations. To address this safety issue, USDA has granted some states and sponsors flexibility from the requirement that children consume meals on-site. However, USDA has not broadly communicated the circumstances it considers when granting this flexibility. Further, some states and sponsors that have requested this flexibility reported difficulty obtaining data to show these circumstances exist, hampering their ability to ensure safe meal delivery. GAO is making four recommendations, including that USDA improve estimates of children's participation in SFSP and communicate the circumstances it considers when granting flexibilities to ensure safe meal delivery.

{"pred": " \n\nThe GAO report examines the documentation and timeliness of reviews of providers' clinical care at five VA medical centers from October 2013 to March 2017. Key findings include that almost half of the required reviews were not documented, and in some cases, reviews were not conducted at all. The report identifies two main reasons for these issues: VHA policy does not require documentation of all types of reviews and does not establish timeliness requirements for initiating reviews. Additionally, VHA's oversight of these reviews is inadequate, as networks are not routinely overseeing the credentialing and privileging processes at their respective VA medical centers. The report recommends that VHA require documentation of all reviews, establish timeliness requirements, and strengthen oversight by requiring networks to ensure that reviews are documented and initiated in a timely manner. The report also highlights that from October 2013 to March 2017, only one of nine providers required to be reported to the NPDB was actually reported, and none were reported to state licensing boards as required by VHA policy. This is attributed to VA medical center officials' unfamiliarity with or misinterpretation of VHA policies, as well as VHA's failure to require networks to oversee reporting to the NPDB and state licensing boards. The report concludes that VHA's failure to report providers to the NPDB and state licensing boards as required facilitates providers who provide substandard care at one facility from obtaining privileges at another VA medical center or at hospitals outside of VA's health care system. The report recommends that VHA require its networks to establish a process for overseeing VA medical centers to ensure they are reporting to the NPDB and to state licensing boards and to ensure that this reporting is timely. The report emphasizes the importance of proper documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care and reporting to the NPDB and state licensing boards to ensure patient safety and prevent substandard care. The report also highlights the need for stronger oversight by VHA to ensure compliance with policies and procedures. The report concludes that VHA's failure to properly document and report providers' clinical care and to ensure timely reviews and reporting undermines patient safety and trust in the VA healthcare system. The report recommends that VHA take steps to address these issues to improve patient care and safety. The report also notes that the VA medical centers did not always conduct reviews of providers' clinical care in a timely manner, with some reviews not starting for up to multiple years after concerns were raised.

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (VAMC) officials are responsible for reviewing the clinical care delivered by their privileged providers—physicians and dentists who are approved to independently perform specific services—after concerns are raised. The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care. For example, GAO found that after one VAMC failed to report to the NPDB or SLBs a provider who resigned to avoid an adverse privileging action, a non-VA hospital in the same city took an adverse privileging action against that same provider for the same reason 2 years later."], "length": 27209}

Key challenges include difficulties in acquiring suitable land for new national cemeteries, inaccuracies in cost estimates for establishing new cemeteries, and the lack of comprehensive data to inform the Grants Program targeting unserved veteran populations. As of September 2019, NCA had opened only four of the 18 planned new national cemeteries, falling far behind its original schedule. The report highlights that NCA's cost-estimating guidance does not fully incorporate the 12 steps identified in the GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide, leading to unreliable cost estimates. Additionally, the report recommends that the Under Secretary for Memorial Affairs update NCA's cost-estimating procedures to fully incorporate these 12 steps.

The House Appropriations Committee has expressed concerns that there are geographic pockets where veterans remain unserved by burial options. House Report 115-188 accompanying a bill for the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018, includes a provision for GAO to examine veterans' access to burial options. This report (1) describes VA's plan for increasing reasonable access to burial options for veterans and (2) assesses VA's progress in implementing its plan and any challenges experienced. GAO reviewed applicable VA and NCA documents, compared NCA's cost-estimating practices with GAO's cost-estimating 12 steps, and met with cognizant officials regarding NCA's efforts to provide reasonable access to burial options. Within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) has a plan to establish 18 new national cemeteries to increase reasonable access to burial options for veterans. NCA defines reasonable access as a national or state veterans' cemetery being located within 75 miles of veterans' homes. Key parts of NCA's plan include establishing 13 urban and rural initiative national cemeteries and awarding grant funds to state applicants for establishing new state veterans' cemeteries. NCA has made limited progress in implementing its plan to increase burial access and is years behind its original schedule for opening new cemeteries. For example, NCA has opened only two of its planned urban and rural initiative sites and is behind its original schedule for the other 11 (see fig. below). The primary factor delaying NCA's completion of these cemeteries has been challenges in acquiring suitable land. NCA has also been challenged in producing accurate estimates of construction costs for most of its rural initiative sites. Cost estimates have increased more than 200 percent (from about $7 million to $24 million) for these sites, and NCA's guidance for developing cost estimates for the cemeteries does not fully incorporate the 12 steps identified in cost-estimating leading practices—such as conducting a risk and uncertainty analysis or a sensitivity analysis. As a result, NCA is not well positioned to provide reliable and valid cost estimates to better inform decisions to enhance veterans' cemetery access. GAO recommends that NCA fully adopt cost-estimating leading practices into its procedures to assist in improving its cost estimates for establishing cemeteries.

Key challenges include identifying and accurately counting these youth, as many avoid shelters and are reluctant to disclose their status. The program supports three main initiatives: Basic Center Program (BCP) for short-term shelter and services, Transitional Living Program (TLP) for longer-term support, and Street Outreach Program (SOP) for street-based outreach. Since 2017, funding has increased, with $127.4 million allocated annually for BCP and TLP combined. The program faces ongoing challenges in measuring long-term outcomes and ensuring effective service delivery, particularly for LGBTQ youth and those in foster care. Innovative efforts include the Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program and the 100-Day Challenges to End Youth Homelessness, which aim to reduce youth homelessness through community-wide initiatives. The program's effectiveness is continually assessed through evaluations and studies, such as the Voices of Youth Count, which provides national estimates of youth homelessness. The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act mandates periodic studies to inform policy and improve services for these vulnerable youth. The program's evolution reflects a growing recognition of the complex factors contributing to youth homelessness and the need for comprehensive, multi-faceted support. Key evidence includes data from the National Runaway Safeline, which handles nearly 30,000 contacts annually, and the National Youth in Transition Database, which reports that about 43% of foster youth aged 21 have experienced homelessness. Unique points include the emphasis on addressing the root causes of youth homelessness and the integration of services across multiple sectors, such as education, healthcare, and housing. The program's adaptability to changing needs, such as the inclusion of LGBTQ youth and those in foster care, highlights its evolving nature in response to emerging challenges.

There is no single definition of the terms \"runaway youth\" or \"homeless youth.\" However, both groups of youth share the risk of not having adequate shelter and other provisions, and may engage in harmful behaviors while away from a permanent home. Youth most often cite family conflict as the major reason for their homelessness or episodes of running away. A youth's sexual orientation, sexual activity, school problems, and substance abuse are associated with family discord. The precise number of homeless and runaway youth is unknown due to their residential mobility and overlap among the populations. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is supporting data collection efforts, known as Voices of Youth Count, to better determine the number of homeless youth. The 2017 study found that approximately 700,000 youth ages 13 to 17 and 3.5 million young adults ages 18 to 25 experienced homelessness within a 12-month period because they were sleeping in places not meant for habitation, in shelters, or with others while lacking alternative living arrangements. From the early 20th century through the 1960s, the needs of runaway and homeless youth were handled locally through the child welfare agency, juvenile justice courts, or both. The 1970s marked a shift toward federal oversight of programs that help youth who had run afoul of the law, including those who committed status offenses (i.e., a noncriminal act that is considered a violation of the law because of the youth's age). The Runaway Youth Act of 1974 was enacted as Title III of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (P.L. 93-415) to assist runaways through services specifically for this population. The act was amended over time to include homeless youth. It authorizes funding for services carried out under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Program (RHYP), which is administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The program was most recently authorized through FY2020 by the Juvenile Justice Reform Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-385). This law did not make other changes to the RHYP statute. Funding is discretionary, meaning provided through the appropriations process. FY2019 appropriations are $127.4 million. The RHYP program is made up of three components: the Basic Center Program (BCP), Transitional Living Program (TLP), and Street Outreach Program (SOP). The BCP provides temporary shelter, counseling, and after care services to runaway and homeless youth under age 18 and their families. In FY2017, the program served 23,288 youth, and in FY2018 it funded 280 BCP shelters (most recent figures available). The TLP is targeted to older youth ages 16 through 22 (and sometimes an older age). In FY2017, the TLP program served 3,517 youth, and in FY2018 it funded 299 grantees (most recent figures available). Youth who use the TLP receive longer-term housing with supportive services. The SOP provides education, treatment, counseling, and referrals for runaway, homeless, and street youth who have been subjected to, or are at risk of being subjected to, sexual abuse, sex exploitation, and trafficking. In FY2017, the SOP grantees made contact with 24,366 youth. The RHYP is a part of larger federal efforts to end youth homelessness through the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH). The USICH is a coordinating body made up of multiple federal agencies committed to addressing homelessness. The USICH's Opening Doors plan to end homelessness includes strategies for ending youth homelessness by 2020, including through collecting better data and supporting evidence-based practices to improve youth outcomes. Voices of Youth Count is continuing to report on characteristics of homeless youth. In addition to the RHYP, there are other federal supports to address youth homelessness.

{"pred": " \n\nThe Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in the U.S. has evolved due to changes in domestic crude oil production and consumption patterns, making it less relevant for addressing supply disruptions. The U.S. is expected to become a net exporter of crude oil by the late 2020s, eliminating the need for a 90-day reserve obligation based on net imports. However, the SPR remains crucial for responding to domestic supply disruptions, particularly in regions vulnerable to fuel shortages. The reserve's current configuration, primarily storing crude oil, limits its effectiveness in addressing disruptions affecting the refining sector. The Department of Energy (DOE) has not conducted a comprehensive re-evaluation of the SPR since 2005, and its 2016 review did not fully consider the implications of market fluctuations, private sector responses, or the costs and benefits of different reserve sizes. Recommendations include supplementing the 2016 review with additional analysis, conducting periodic strategic reviews, studying the costs and benefits of regional petroleum product reserves, and considering a full range of options for handling excess assets. The SPR's modernization plans are uncertain due to ongoing congressionally mandated oil sales, which could create excess storage capacity. Addressing these issues is essential for ensuring the SPR remains effective and efficient in meeting U.S. energy security needs and international obligations. Key evidence includes projections of U.S. crude oil production and consumption, the SPR's storage capacity, and the potential economic benefits of regional petroleum product reserves. Innovative points include the recommendation to consider a long-term target for the SPR's size and configuration, taking into account future market conditions and energy security needs. The report also highlights the importance of private sector responses and the need for a comprehensive re-evaluation of the SPR's role and size. The Department of Energy's partial agreement with some recommendations underscores the need for further action to address these critical issues.

DOE manages the SPR. As a member of the International Energy Agency, the United States is obligated to maintain reserves equivalent to at least 90 days of the previous year's net imports (imports minus exports). The SPR's storage and related infrastructure is aging, and DOE has plans to modernize these facilities. Since 2015, Congress has mandated crude oil sales. As of March 2018, the SPR held about 665 million barrels of crude oil. GAO was asked to examine the SPR's ability to meet U.S. energy security needs. This report examines, among other things, the extent to which (1) DOE has identified the optimal size of the SPR, and (2) DOE's plans for modernizing the SPR take into account the effects of congressionally mandated crude oil sales. GAO reviewed DOE's plans and studies, and interviewed agency officials and nine experts selected based on prior work, referrals, and a literature review. The Department of Energy (DOE) has not identified the optimal size of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). In 2016, DOE completed a long-term strategic review of the SPR after its last comprehensive examination conducted in 2005. The 2016 review examined the benefits of several SPR sizes, but it did not identify an optimal size and its review was limited in several ways. In particular, DOE did not fully consider recent and expected future changes in market conditions, such as the implications of falling net imports, or the role that increased levels of private reserves (reserves held by private companies for their own purposes) may play in responding to supply disruptions. These changes have contributed to SPR and private reserves reaching historically high levels on a net imports basis (see figure). These changes are expected to continue to evolve—according to government projections, the United States will become a net exporter in the late 2020s before again becoming a net importer between 2040 and 2050. GAO has found that agencies should reexamine their programs if conditions change. Without addressing the limitations of its 2016 review and periodically performing reexaminations in the future, DOE cannot be assured that the SPR will be sized appropriately into the future. DOE has taken steps to take into account congressionally mandated sales of SPR crude oil in its $1.4 billion modernization plans for SPR's infrastructure and facilities. The SPR is projected to hold 405 million barrels of oil by the end of fiscal year 2027. However, DOE's current plans are based on information analyzed prior to recently mandated sales. According to DOE officials, the agency began a study in March 2018 to assess the effects of these sales on the SPR's modernization. However, this study is not examining all options for handling any excess SPR assets that may be created by currently mandated sales or any additional sales that may be mandated in the future, inconsistent with an agency order on real property asset management that calls for identifying excess assets. For example, DOE does not plan to examine the potential to lease unused SPR storage capacity to the private sector because DOE is not currently authorized to enter into such leases, according to agency officials. If authorized, leasing capacity could generate revenues that could help offset the costs of modernization. By not examining a full range of options, DOE risks missing beneficial ways to modernize the SPR while saving taxpayer resources. GAO is making four recommendations, including that DOE (1) supplement the 2016 review by conducting an additional analysis, (2) ensure that the agency periodically reexamines the size of the SPR, and (3) consider a full range of options for handling potentially excess assets as it conducts its study, among other things. DOE agreed with two, partially agreed with one, and disagreed with another recommendation on refined product reserve studies. GAO maintains that the recommendations are valid."], "length": 27604}

{"pred": " \n\nThe passage discusses the historical development and regulation of emergency powers in the United States, primarily focusing on the evolution of presidential emergency powers from the early days of the Republic to the present. Key points include:\n\n1. Early emergency powers were largely derived from the Constitution and statutory law, with Presidents exercising discretion in times of crisis.\n2. The National Emergencies Act of 1976 aimed to regulate the use of emergency powers by requiring formal declarations and periodic reviews, though it did not significantly limit the scope of presidential authority.\n3. Emergency powers have been used across various administrations, addressing diverse crises from wars to natural disasters, with some powers rooted in statutory law and others in constitutional authority.\n4. The passage highlights the tension between the broad discretion afforded to presidents in emergencies and the need for checks and balances through legislative oversight and judicial review. The National Emergencies Act sought to address this tension by providing a framework for declaring and terminating national emergencies, but its effectiveness has been limited by subsequent legal challenges and evolving interpretations of presidential powers. The Act has led to the declaration of numerous national emergencies, some of which remain in effect, while others have been terminated. The passage underscores the ongoing debate over the appropriate balance between executive flexibility and legislative oversight in managing national emergencies. Key evidence includes the historical context of emergency powers, the text of the National Emergencies Act, and examples of national emergencies declared since its enactment. Unique points include the evolution of emergency powers from constitutional and statutory roots to a mix of statutory delegations and presidential discretion, and the challenges faced by the National Emergencies Act in achieving its goals of regulatory clarity and accountability. The passage also notes the potential for abuse of emergency powers and the importance of maintaining a balance between executive authority and legislative oversight. The summary concludes by emphasizing the need for continued scrutiny and reform of emergency powers to ensure they serve the public interest while respecting constitutional principles.

Such powers may be stated explicitly or implied by the Constitution, assumed by the Chief Executive to be permissible constitutionally, or inferred from or specified by statute. Through legislation, Congress has made a great many delegations of authority in this regard over the past 230 years. There are, however, limits and restraints upon the President in his exercise of emergency powers. With the exception of the habeas corpus clause, the Constitution makes no allowance for the suspension of any of its provisions during a national emergency. Disputes over the constitutionality or legality of the exercise of emergency powers are judicially reviewable. Both the judiciary and Congress, as co-equal branches, can restrain the executive regarding emergency powers. So can public opinion. Since 1976, the President has been subject to certain procedural formalities in utilizing some statutorily delegated emergency authority. The National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. §§1601-1651) eliminated or modified some statutory grants of emergency authority, required the President to formally declare the existence of a national emergency and to specify what statutory authority activated by the declaration would be used, and provided Congress a means to countermand the President's declaration and the activated authority being sought.

DOD manages its workforce under several statutes, including sections 129, 129a, and 2463 of Title 10 of the U.S. Code, which direct the determination of the optimal mix of military, civilian, and contracted services. DOD Instruction 1100.22 outlines the process for determining the appropriate workforce mix and mandates cost comparisons for new or expanding mission requirements and functions previously contracted to civilians. Over the past decade, DOD has improved its methodology for estimating and comparing the full costs of work performed by military, civilian, and contractor personnel, but still faces challenges in accounting for all cost elements, particularly overhead. Despite these efforts, DOD has not fully addressed the requirement to account for the fully-burdened costs of federal civilians and service contractors, as mandated by Congress. The report concludes that DOD's cost comparison report partially addressed the mandated elements but did not include all necessary non-labor costs, thereby failing to account for the full cost of personnel as required. The report recommends that DOD should include all labor and non-labor costs in its future cost comparisons to ensure comprehensive and accurate assessments of workforce costs. Key evidence includes DOD's improved methodology for estimating labor costs and the limitations in accounting for non-labor costs, such as overhead. Unique points include the recognition of the challenges in aligning different taxonomies and lexicons for federal civilian, military, and contracted services workforces, and the ongoing efforts to improve available workforce data for better-informed leadership decisions. The report also highlights the importance of including non-labor costs in future cost comparisons to fully account for the burdened costs of personnel. The findings underscore the need for DOD to refine its cost estimation processes to meet legislative mandates and support more informed workforce management decisions.

The Senate report also included a provision for GAO to assess DOD's report, which DOD submitted to Congress in April 2017. This report examines the extent to which DOD's report addressed the prescribed congressional elements. GAO reviewed DOD's report and compared it to the prescribed elements, examined documents relevant to DOD's cost estimating and comparison methodology, and interviewed DOD officials, including those in its Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation responsible for the calculations in DOD's report. In response to Congressional direction, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a report in April 2017 comparing the costs of federal civilian and service contractor personnel at select installations. The report addressed three out of four provision elements and partially addressed one, as discussed below. DOD concluded that neither federal civilians nor service contractors were predominately more or less expensive, with costs being dependent on position, location, and level of seniority. DOD noted that it used a non-probability based sample of personnel for its report, and the results are not generalizable. An assessment of performance of functions being performed by federal civilian and service contractor personnel at six military installations, with four being in the continental United States and two being outside the continental United States. GAO believes that DOD addressed this requirement because it developed a methodology to assess performance of functions performed by federal civilians and service contractors at 17 organizations within nine geographic regions including two locations outside the continental United States. DOD used data from the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System to identify military installations with large reported numbers of federal civilians. DOD determined that personnel need to perform at least 80 percent common tasks to be able to make a comparison. An accounting of the fully-burdened, or full, cost of federal civilian and service contractor personnel performing functions at the selected installations including training, benefits, reimbursable costs, and facility overhead.

These agencies have varying authorities for acquiring and disposing of federal lands. The NPS and FWS have limited acquisition powers, with the NPS lacking general authority to dispose of lands, while the BLM has broad authority to acquire and dispose of lands. The USFS has moderate acquisition and disposal powers, and the BLM's authority is the most extensive. The report highlights the complexity of land management and acquisition/disposal authorities, noting that while some authorities are broad, others are highly restrictive. The report also discusses the importance of the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) for funding land acquisition and the various specific authorities for land exchanges and sales. The BLM has the most flexible land disposal authorities, including the ability to conduct land exchanges and sales under the Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act (FLTFA). The report concludes by noting that the adequacy and effectiveness of these authorities are often subjects of congressional debate and legislative proposals. Key evidence includes the specific authorities granted to each agency, the limitations on these authorities, and the role of the LWCF in funding land acquisition. Unique points include the broad authority of the BLM and the importance of the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund for the FWS. The report emphasizes the need for clear and consistent land management policies to balance public and private interests. The federal government's extensive land holdings, managed by four key agencies, face varying acquisition and disposal authorities. The National Park Service (NPS) and Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) have limited powers, with the NPS lacking disposal authority altogether. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) holds the broadest authority, enabling it to acquire and dispose of lands extensively. The U.S. Forest Service (USFS) has moderate powers. The report underscores the critical role of the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) in funding land acquisitions. Specific authorities for exchanges and sales, particularly under the Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act (FLTFA), are highlighted for the BLM.

Four agencies—the National Park Service (NPS), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in the Department of the Interior, and the U.S. Forest Service (FS) in the Department of Agriculture—administer about 95% of those lands. The extent to which each of these four federal agencies have authority to acquire and dispose of land varies considerably. The BLM has relatively broad authority for both acquisitions and disposals under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA). The agency also has other authorities for disposing of land, including two laws that allow the agency to retain the proceeds for subsequent land acquisition, among other purposes, and a law that allows transfers to governmental units and other entities for public purposes. By contrast, the NPS has no general authority to acquire land to create new park units or to dispose of park lands. The FS authority to acquire lands is mostly limited to lands within or contiguous to the boundaries of a national forest. The agency has various authorities to dispose of land, but they are relatively constrained and infrequently used. The FWS has various authorities to acquire lands but no general authority to dispose of its lands. The agency frequently uses acquisition authority under the Migratory Bird Conservation Act of 1929 because of the availability of funding through the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund. The nature of the acquisition and disposal authorities of the four federal agencies also varies. In general, the acquisition authorities are designed to allow the four agencies to bring into federal ownership lands that many contend could benefit from federal management. Disposal authorities generally are designed to allow agencies to convey land that is no longer needed for a federal purpose or that might be chiefly valuable for another purpose. Some of the authorities specify particular circumstances where they can be used, such as the conveyance of FS land for educational purposes and the disposal of BLM land for recreation and public purposes. Congress often faces questions on the adequacy of existing acquisition and disposal authorities; the nature, extent, and location of their use; and the extent of federal land ownership overall. The current acquisition and disposal authorities form the backdrop for consideration of measures to establish, modify, or eliminate authorities, or to provide for the acquisition or disposal of particular lands. In some cases, Congress enacts bills to provide authority to acquire or dispose of particular parcels where no standing authority exists and, in other cases, to direct or facilitate land transactions. Congress also addresses acquisition and disposal policy in the context of debates on the role and goals of the federal government in owning and managing land generally, and it has considered broader measures to dispose of lands or to promote acquisition. Other issues for Congress pertain to the sources and levels of funds for land acquisition. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) is the primary source of funding for land acquisition. Congress has considered diverse measures related to the LWCF, such as legislation to make LWCF funding permanent and bills to direct LWCF monies to additional, nonacquisition purposes.

The Disposal Act of 2010 amended the Controlled Substances Act to allow the public to safely dispose of unused controlled substances through various methods, including disposal bins, mail-back programs, and take-back events. DEA is responsible for implementing these regulations, which aim to balance public health and safety with ease and cost of implementation. As of April 2017, only about 2.5% of eligible entities, such as pharmacies and hospitals, had registered to use disposal bins to collect unused prescription drugs. Participation rates varied significantly by state, with North Dakota having the highest rate and Connecticut, Missouri, and Maine having the lowest. Urban areas had higher participation rates compared to rural areas. Despite the low participation, about half of the country's population lived within 5 miles of a disposal bin. Several factors, including costs, uncertainty over proper implementation, and participation in other similar efforts, contributed to the low rate of participation. The DEA does not collect detailed information on the use of disposal bins, such as the amount and types of drugs disposed of, due to regulatory limitations. Key evidence includes the low participation rates, variations by state and urban/rural areas, and stakeholder interviews highlighting cost and uncertainty as barriers to participation. Innovative points include the DEA's role in promoting safe disposal methods and the potential for extended producer responsibility ordinances to alleviate costs. The report concludes that while the DEA has established a framework for safe disposal, efforts to increase participation and address barriers are needed to maximize the effectiveness of the program. The DEA's regulations for disposal bins require that collected substances be destroyed in a manner that renders them non-retrievable, posing challenges for authorized collectors in terms of compliance and cost.

About half of the people who reported misusing prescription drugs in 2015 received them from a friend or relative. One way to help prevent this kind of diversion and potential misuse is by providing secure and convenient ways to dispose of unused, unneeded, or expired prescription medications. The Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010 authorizes pharmacies and other entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances to also collect unused prescription drugs for disposal. In 2014, DEA finalized regulations for the implementation of the Act, establishing a voluntary process for eligible entities to become authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs using disposal bins. GAO was asked to review participation among authorized collectors that maintain disposal bins. In this report GAO describes (1) participation rates among entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs and (2) factors that affect participation. GAO analyzed the most currently available DEA data from April 2017 on entities eligible to participate and those participating as authorized collectors. GAO also conducted interviews with DEA officials and a nongeneralizable sample of 11 stakeholder organizations selected to illustrate different types of authorized collectors and long-term care facilities. GAO is not making any recommendations. DEA provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. GAO found that about 3 percent of pharmacies and other entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs for disposal have volunteered to do so. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) authorizes these entities to dispose of unused drugs to help reduce their potential misuse. Analysis of DEA data shows that as of April 2017, 2,233 of the 89,550 (2.49 percent) eligible entities—that is, certain entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances—had registered with DEA to use disposal bins to collect unused prescription drugs. Most—about 81 percent—of the authorized collectors were pharmacies, followed by hospitals or clinics. GAO also found that participation rates varied by state, though in 44 states less than 5 percent of the state's pharmacies and other eligible entities had registered to become authorized collectors. Stakeholders cited several factors that may explain why relatively few pharmacies and other eligible entities have registered with DEA as authorized collectors of unused drugs. Most notably, stakeholders representing authorized collectors told GAO that because participation is voluntary, the cost associated with maintaining a disposal bin—which includes purchasing and installing the bin according to DEA requirements and paying for the destruction of its contents—is an important factor to weigh against potential benefits. DEA noted that availability of disposal by law enforcement agencies also contributes to low participation."], "length": 27255}

Although there are no reliable estimates of fraud in Medicare, in fiscal year 2017 improper payments for Medicare were estimated at about $52 billion. Further, about $1.4 billion was returned to Medicare Trust Funds in fiscal year 2017 as a result of recoveries, fines, and asset forfeitures. In December 2017, GAO issued a report examining how CMS managed its fraud risks overall and particularly the extent to which its efforts in the Medicare and Medicaid programs aligned with GAO's Framework. This testimony, based on that report, discusses the extent to which CMS's management of fraud risks in Medicare aligns with the Framework. For the report, GAO reviewed CMS policies and interviewed officials and external stakeholders. In its December 2017 report, GAO found that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) antifraud efforts for Medicare partially align with GAO's 2015 A Framework for Managing Fraud Risks in Federal Programs (Framework). The Fraud Reduction and Data Analytics Act of 2015 required OMB to incorporate leading practices identified in this Framework in its guidance to agencies on addressing fraud risks. Consistent with the Framework, GAO determined that CMS had demonstrated commitment to combating fraud by creating a dedicated entity to lead antifraud efforts; the Center for Program Integrity (CPI) serves as this entity for fraud, waste, and abuse issues in Medicare. CMS also promoted an antifraud culture by, for example, coordinating with internal stakeholders to incorporate antifraud features into new program design. To increase awareness of fraud risks in Medicare, CMS offered and required training for stakeholder groups such as providers of medical services, but it did not offer or require similar fraud-awareness training for most of its workforce. CMS took some steps to identify fraud risks in Medicare; however, it had not conducted a fraud risk assessment or designed and implemented a risk-based antifraud strategy for Medicare as defined in the Framework. CMS identified fraud risks through control activities that target areas the agency designated as higher risk within Medicare, including specific provider types, such as home health agencies. Building on earlier steps and conducting a fraud risk assessment, consistent with the Framework, would provide the detailed information and insights needed to create a fraud risk profile, which, in turn, is the basis for creating an antifraud strategy. CMS established monitoring and evaluation mechanisms for its program-integrity control activities that, if aligned with an antifraud strategy, could enhance the effectiveness of fraud risk management in Medicare. For example, CMS used return-on-investment and savings estimates to measure the effectiveness of its Medicare program-integrity activities. In developing an antifraud strategy, consistent with the Framework, CMS could include plans for refining and building on existing methods such as return-on-investment, to evaluate the effectiveness of all of its antifraud efforts. In its December 2017 report, GAO made three recommendations, namely that CMS (1) require and provide fraud-awareness training to its employees; (2) conduct fraud risk assessments; and (3) create an antifraud strategy for Medicare, including an approach for evaluation. The Department of Health and Human Services agreed with these recommendations and reportedly is evaluating options to implement them. Accordingly, the recommendations remain open."], "length": 25720}

NG911 systems can handle voice calls, location information, and multimedia messages, enhancing call center capabilities and improving information sharing. The transition to NG911 involves both technical and operational changes, and can be gradual, phased, and concurrent with legacy systems. Federal agencies like NHTSA, NTIA, FCC, and DHS play roles in supporting states and localities in implementing NG911, including through grants, standards, and guidance. Challenges include funding constraints, evolving technology, governance issues, and cybersecurity risks. The National 911 Program, as the lead entity, faces difficulties in measuring progress and effectiveness without specific goals and performance measures. Recommendations are made for the National 911 Program to develop goals, clarify roles, and create an implementation plan for the NG911 roadmap. Key evidence includes survey data showing mixed progress in NG911 implementation and federal agency actions to assist states and localities. Unique points highlight the complexity of the NG911 transition and the need for clear objectives to ensure effective assistance to states and localities. The passage emphasizes the importance of federal coordination and support in achieving a fully interconnected national NG911 system. The National 911 Program's lack of specific goals and performance measures hinders its ability to assess progress and effectiveness. Federal agencies are taking various actions to support NG911 implementation, such as issuing guides, providing grants, and examining cybersecurity risks. However, the National 911 Program needs clearer objectives and roles to better coordinate and support the transition. The NG911 roadmap initiative aims to identify national-level tasks and roles for federal agencies, but the program lacks a clear plan for implementation. The passage concludes by recommending that the National 911 Program develop specific goals, clarify roles, and create an implementation plan to support the NG911 roadmap's objectives. This would help ensure effective federal support for NG911 implementation and improve the nation's 911 services. The Holman rule, which restricts legislative provisions in appropriations bills to those that reduce expenditures, is briefly explained, noting its evolution and current form. The rule allows for retrenchments that reduce the number and salary of federal officials or compensation of persons paid from the Treasury, but not for broader legislative provisions", "answers": ["Each year, millions of Americans call 911 for help during emergencies. However, the nation's legacy 911 system relies on aging infrastructure that is not designed to accommodate modern communications technologies. As a result, states and localities are upgrading to NG911, which offers improved capabilities, such as the ability to process images, audio files, and video. While deploying NG911 is the responsibility of state and local entities, federal agencies also support implementation, led by NHTSA's National 911 Program, which facilitates collaboration among federal, state, and local 911 stakeholders. GAO was asked to review NG911 implementation nationwide. This report examines: (1) state and local progress and challenges in implementing NG911 and (2) federal actions to address challenges and planned next steps. GAO reviewed relevant statutes, regulations, and federal agency reports and plans. GAO also analyzed NHTSA's survey data on state 911 implementation for calendar year 2015, the most recent year for which data were available, and interviewed federal officials, state and local officials from nine states (selected to represent different regions and various phases of NG911 implementation), and officials from industry and advocacy groups. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) National 911 Program's most recent national survey on Next Generation 911 (NG911) implementation indicated that about half of states were in some phase of transition to NG911 in 2015, but that state and local progress varied. Specifically, 10 states reported that all 911 authorities in their state processed calls using NG911 systems; however, 18 states reported having no state or local NG911 transition plans in place—which may indicate these states were in the early phases of planning for the transition to NG911 or had not yet begun. GAO spoke with state and local 911 officials in 9 states, which were in various phases of implementing NG911, and found that none of the 9 selected states were accepting images, audio files, or video. State and local 911 officials identified a number of challenges to implementing NG911. Such challenges are related to funding, evolving technology and operations, and governance. For example, officials in 3 states said that the current funding they collect from telephone service subscribers may not be sufficient to support NG911's transition costs while simultaneously funding the operation of existing 911 systems. Federal agencies—including NHTSA, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, the Federal Communications Commission, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security—have responsibilities to support NG911 implementation, such as through coordinating activities and administering grants, and are taking actions to assist state and local entities in addressing challenges to NG911's implementation. Such actions include developing resources, offering technical assistance, and convening stakeholders to explore emerging NG911 issues. For example, as the lead entity for coordinating federal NG911 efforts, NHTSA's National 911 Program is developing resources on NG911 topics, such as federal funding and governance structures. While the National 911 Program is taking steps to facilitate the state and local transition to NG911, the program lacks specific performance goals and measures to assess its progress. Without such goals and measures, it is not clear to what extent the program is effectively achieving its mission. In 2018, the National 911 Program plans to establish an interagency initiative tasked with creating a National NG911 Roadmap. This roadmap is intended to identify next steps for the federal government in supporting the creation of a national, interconnected NG911 system. While the National 911 Program is taking steps to develop a list of national-level tasks as part of its roadmap initiative, the program does not have a plan to identify: (1) roles or responsibilities for federal entities to carry out these tasks or (2) how the program plans to achieve the roadmap's objectives. Collaborating with the appropriate federal agencies to determine federal roles and responsibilities to carry out the roadmap's national-level tasks could reduce barriers to agencies effectively working together to achieve those tasks. Furthermore, developing an implementation plan that details how the roadmap's tasks will be achieved would place the National 911 Program in a better position to effectively lead interagency efforts to implement NG911 nationwide. GAO recommends that NHTSA's National 911 Program develop performance goals and measures and, for the National NG911 Roadmap, determine agencies' roles and responsibilities and develop an implementation plan.

{"pred": " \n\nThe passage discusses challenges faced by the VA in aligning its services and real property portfolio to meet the needs of veterans. Key issues include geographic shifts in the veterans' population, changes in healthcare delivery, an aging infrastructure, and limited stakeholder involvement. The VA faces difficulties in modernizing, renovating, and retrofitting older facilities, especially those with historic status. Additionally, the passage highlights the limitations of the VA's Strategic Capital Investment Planning (SCIP) and VA Integrated Planning (VAIP) processes, which are used to plan and prioritize capital projects. These processes have subjective narratives, long timeframes, and restricted access to information, making it challenging for the VA to achieve its goals. The VA has not consistently engaged stakeholders, leading to adversarial relationships that hinder facility alignment efforts. The passage also notes that the VAIP process assumes all future growth in services will be provided directly through VA facilities, which is inaccurate given the increasing use of non-VA providers. The VA has taken some actions to address these limitations but has not fully resolved them. The passage concludes by suggesting that Congress may wish to consider seven elements DOD relied on when developing its BRAC recommendations for disposing of or realigning military property, such as establishing goals, criteria, and oversight mechanisms, to improve VA's alignment efforts. The VA's challenges highlight the need for a more robust and transparent process to effectively manage its facilities and resources. Key evidence includes the VA's inventory of 430 vacant or mostly vacant buildings and 784 underutilized buildings, as well as the 2,957 historic buildings held by the VA. Unique points include the emphasis on the importance of stakeholder engagement and the need to address the limitations of existing planning processes to ensure the VA can better align its facilities with the needs of veterans. The passage also underscores the complexity of interdependent recommendations and the need for sustained senior leadership attention during implementation. The VA's challenges in aligning its services and real property portfolio to meet the needs of veterans stem from geographic shifts, changes in healthcare delivery, an aging infrastructure, and limited stakeholder involvement.

DOD has repeatedly applied the BRAC process to reduce the amount of unneeded property that it owns and leases and to save billions of dollars that could be applied to higher priority defense needs. This statement is based on GAO's April 2017 report related to VA facility alignment ( GAO-17-349 ) and numerous GAO reports related to the BRAC process as summarized in a June 2011 testimony ( GAO-11-704T ) and a March 2012 testimony ( GAO-12-513T ). This statement addresses (1) the factors that affect VA's facility alignment and the extent to which VA's capital-planning process facilitates the alignment of facilities with the veterans' population, and (2) the key elements and challenges affecting DOD and the Commission in BRAC 2005. Detailed information on our scope and methodologies for this work can be found in these published products, cited throughout this testimony. Geographic shifts in the veterans' population, changes in health care delivery, aging infrastructure, and limited stakeholder involvement affect the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) efforts to align its services and real property portfolio to meet the needs of veterans. For example, a shift over time from inpatient to outpatient care will likely result in underutilized space once used for inpatient care. Further, the historic status of some VA facilities adds to the complexity of converting or disposing of them. In such instances, it is often difficult and costly for VA to modernize, renovate, and retrofit these older facilities. GAO reported that two of the planning processes VA uses to align its facilities—VA's Strategic Capital Investment Planning (SCIP) and the VA Integrated Planning (VAIP)—have limitations that undermine VA's efforts to achieve its goals. Specifically: VA relies on the SCIP process to plan and prioritize capital projects, but VA routinely asks its facility planners to submit their next year's planned project narratives before knowing if their previous submissions have been funded. The overlapping budget cycle, which is outside of VA's control, combined with other SCIP limitations—including subjective narratives, long time frames, and restricted access to information—make it difficult for VA to rely on SCIP to accurately identify the capital necessary to address its service and infrastructure gaps. VA concurred that it needs to address SCIP limitations that are within its control, as GAO recommended; VA has made some progress in implementing the recommendation has made some progress in implementing the recommendation.\\ The VAIP process is estimated to cost $108 million and to produce market-level service delivery plans and facility master plans. However, the VAIP master plans incorrectly assume that all future growth in services will be provided directly through VA facilities without considering alternatives, such as purchasing care from the community. GAO recommended that VA consider discontinuing the VAIP facility master plans pending an assessment of their value as a facility-planning tool. VA agreed with the recommendation and is implementing it while pursuing a national realignment strategy.. Key elements of the Department of Defense's (DOD) 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process could benefit VA's asset and infrastructure review. The key elements included: (1) establishing goals for the process, (2) developing criteria for evaluating closures and realignments, and (3) establishing an organizational structure to develop closure and realignment options. GAO identified key challenges that affected DOD's implementation of BRAC 2005 and the results achieved; these challenges would need to be addressed if VA is to successfully apply the process. These challenges included: (1) large, complex recommendations required sustained senior leadership's attention and a high level of coordination among many stakeholders, and (2) the large number of actions that depend on each other for successful implementation.

{"pred": " \n\nThe Black Lung Disability Trust Fund (Trust Fund) faces significant financial challenges, with expenditures consistently exceeding revenues since its establishment. Key issues include the scheduled 2019 coal tax rate decrease, which will reduce revenue, and the increasing debt due to interest payments. The Trust Fund's debt is projected to grow to $4.3 billion by 2017 and could reach $15.4 billion by 2050 under current conditions. Various options to address these challenges were simulated, including adjusting the coal tax, forgiving interest, and forgiving debt. Increasing the coal tax by 25% would eliminate debt by 2050, but place a heavy burden on the coal industry. Maintaining current tax rates would require $2.4 billion in debt forgiveness, distributing the burden between the coal industry and general taxpayers. Decreasing tax rates by 25% would require $4.8 billion in debt forgiveness, shifting the burden to general taxpayers. Eliminating or adjusting the coal tax cap could also increase revenue. The simulations highlight the need for a balanced approach to address the Trust Fund's financial challenges, potentially involving a combination of tax adjustments and debt forgiveness. The Trust Fund's financial position is sensitive to future coal production and the number of new beneficiaries, emphasizing the importance of accurate projections and flexible policies. The report provides a range of estimates for the Trust Fund's future borrowing needs and the amount of debt forgiveness required to achieve balance by 2050, offering insights into the financial burden distribution among the coal industry and general taxpayers. The simulations suggest that multiple options could reduce the Trust Fund's future debt and distribute the financial burden effectively, but careful consideration of their impacts on stakeholders is necessary. The report concludes that a comprehensive strategy combining tax adjustments and debt forgiveness is essential to ensure the Trust Fund's sustainability. The analysis underscores the complexity of addressing the Trust Fund's financial challenges and the need for ongoing monitoring and adaptation of policies. The simulations provide valuable guidance for policymakers in developing strategies to manage the Trust Fund's financial position.

The simulations provide a robust framework for understanding the", "answers": ["With revenue of about $450 million in fiscal year 2017, the Trust Fund paid about $184 million in benefits to more than 25,000 coal miners and eligible dependents. However, the Trust Fund also borrowed about $1.3 billion from the Treasury's general fund in fiscal year 2017 to cover its debt repayment expenditures. Adding to this financial challenge, the coal tax that supports the Trust Fund is scheduled to decrease by about 55 percent beginning in 2019. GAO was asked to review the financial positon of the Trust Fund and identify options to improve it. This report examines (1) factors that have challenged the financial position of the Trust Fund since its inception and (2) the extent to which Trust Fund debt may change through 2050, and selected options that could improve its future financial position. GAO reviewed Trust Fund financial data from fiscal years 1979 through 2017. GAO also interviewed officials from the Departments of Labor, Treasury, Health and Human Services (HHS) and representatives of coal industry and union groups. Using assumptions, such as the about 55 percent coal tax decrease and moderately declining coal production, GAO simulated the extent to which Trust Fund debt may change through 2050. GAO also simulated how selected options, such as forgiveness of debt, could improve finances. The options simulated are not intended to be exhaustive. Further, GAO is not endorsing any particular option or combination of options. GAO provided a draft of this report to DOL, Treasury, and HHS. The agencies provided technical comments, which were incorporated as appropriate. Multiple factors have challenged Black Lung Disability Trust Fund (Trust Fund) finances since it was established about 40 years ago. Its expenditures have consistently exceeded its revenues, interest payments have grown, and actions taken that were expected to improve Trust Fund finances did not completely address its debt. When necessary to make expenditures, the Trust Fund borrows with interest from the Department of the Treasury's (Treasury) general fund. Because Trust Fund expenditures have consistently exceeded revenue, it has borrowed almost every year since 1979, its first complete fiscal year, and as a result debt and interest payments increased. Legislative actions were taken over the years including (1) raising the rate of the coal tax that provides Trust Fund revenues and (2) forgiving debt. For example, the Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008 provided an appropriation toward Trust Fund debt forgiveness; about $6.5 billion was forgiven, according to Department of Labor (DOL) data (see figure). However, coal tax revenues were less than expected due, in part, to the 2008 recession and increased competition from other energy sources, according to DOL and Treasury officials. As a result, the Trust Fund continued to borrow from Treasury's general fund from fiscal years 2010 through 2017 to cover debt repayment expenditures. GAO's simulation suggests that Trust Fund borrowing will likely increase from fiscal years 2019 through 2050 due, in part, to the coal tax rate decrease of about 55 percent that will take effect in 2019 and declining coal production. The simulation estimates that Trust Fund borrowing may exceed $15 billion by 2050 (see figure). However, various options, such as adjusting the coal tax and forgiving interest or debt, could reduce future borrowing and improve the Trust Fund's financial position. For example, maintaining the current coal tax rates and forgiving debt of $2.4 billion could, under certain circumstances, balance the Trust Fund by 2050, whereby revenue would be sufficient to cover expenditures. However, a coal industry representative said that maintaining or increasing the coal tax would burden the coal industry, particularly at a time when coal production has been declining. Further, Treasury officials noted that the costs associated with forgiving Trust Fund interest or debt would be paid by taxpayers."], "length": 26778}

Three space telescope projects are the key enablers for NASA to achieve its astrophysics' science goals, which include seeking to understand the universe. In its fiscal year 2018 budget request, NASA asked for about $697 million for these three projects, which represents over 50 percent of NASA's budget for its astrophysics' major projects. In total, these projects represent an expected investment of at least $12.4 billion. This statement reflects preliminary observations on (1) the current status and cost of NASA's major telescope projects and (2) lessons learned that can be applied to NASA's management of its telescope projects. This statement is based on ongoing work on JWST and ongoing work on the status of NASA's major projects. Both reports are planned to be published in Spring 2018. This statement is also based on past GAO reports on JWST and NASA's acquisitions of major projects, and NASA input. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) current portfolio of major space telescopes includes three projects that vary in cost, complexity, and phase of the acquisition life cycle. GAO's ongoing work indicates that these projects are each making progress in line with their phase of the acquisition cycle but also face some challenges. For example, the current launch date for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) project reflects a 57-60-month delay from the project's original schedule. GAO's preliminary observations indicate this project still has significant integration and testing to complete, with very little schedule reserve remaining to account for delays. Therefore, additional delays beyond the delay of up to 8 months recently announced are likely, and funding available under the $8 billion Congressional cost cap for formulation and development may be inadequate. There are a number of lessons learned from its acquisitions that NASA could consider to increase the likelihood of successful outcomes for its telescope projects, as well as for its larger portfolio of projects, such as its human spaceflight projects. For example, twice in the history of the JWST program, independent reviews found that the program was not holding adequate cost and schedule reserves. GAO has found that NASA has not applied this lesson learned to all of its large projects, and similar outcomes to JWST have started to emerge. For example, NASA did not incorporate this lesson with its human spaceflight programs. In July 2016 and April 2017, GAO found that these programs were holding inadequate levels of cost and schedule reserves to cover unexpected cost increases or delays. In April 2017, GAO recommended that NASA reassess the date of the programs' first test flight. NASA concurred and, in November 2017, announced a launch delay of up to 19 months.

Unique points include the emphasis on the role of CIOs in implementing IT management responsibilities and the challenges", "answers": ["The federal government plans to invest almost $96 billion in IT in fiscal year 2018. Historically, IT investments have too often failed or contributed little to mission-related outcomes. Further, increasingly sophisticated threats and frequent cyber incidents underscore the need for effective information security. As a result, GAO added two areas to its high-risk list: IT security in 1997 and the management of IT acquisitions and operations in 2015. This statement summarizes agencies' progress in improving IT management and ensuring the security of federal IT. It is primarily based on GAO's prior reports issued between February 1997 and May 2018 (and an ongoing review) on (1) CIO responsibilities, (2) agency CIOs' involvement in approving IT contracts, (3) data center consolidation efforts, (4) the management of software licenses, and (5) compliance with cybersecurity requirements. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and federal agencies have taken steps to improve the management of information technology (IT) acquisitions and operations and ensure the security of federal IT through a series of initiatives. As of May 2018, agencies had fully implemented about 61 percent of the approximately 800 IT management-related recommendations that GAO made from fiscal years 2010 through 2015. Likewise, since 2010, agencies had implemented about 66 percent of the approximately 2,700 security-related recommendations as of May 2018. Even with this progress, significant actions remain to be completed. Chief Information Officer (CIO) responsibilities . Laws such as the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) and related guidance assigned 35 key IT management responsibilities to CIOs to help address longstanding challenges. However, in a draft report on CIO responsibilities, GAO's preliminary results suggest that none of the 24 selected agencies have policies that fully address the role of their CIO, as called for by federal laws and guidance. GAO intends to recommend that OMB and each of the selected 24 agencies take actions to improve the effectiveness of CIO's implementation of their responsibilities. IT contract approval . According to FITARA, covered agencies' CIOs are required to review and approve IT contracts. Nevertheless, in January 2018, GAO reported that most of the CIOs at 22 selected agencies were not adequately involved in reviewing billions of dollars of IT acquisitions. Consequently, GAO made 39 recommendations to improve CIO oversight over IT acquisitions. Consolidating data centers . OMB launched an initiative in 2010 to reduce data centers, which was codified and expanded in FITARA. According to agencies, data center consolidation and optimization efforts have resulted in approximately $3.9 billion of cost savings through 2018. Even so, additional work remains. GAO has made 160 recommendations to OMB and agencies to improve the reporting of related cost savings and to achieve optimization targets; however, as of May 2018, 80 of the recommendations have not been fully addressed. Managing software licenses . Effective management of software licenses can help avoid purchasing too many licenses that result in unused software. In May 2014, GAO reported that better management of licenses was needed to achieve savings, and made 135 recommendations to improve such management. Four years later, 78 of the recommendations remained open. Improving the security of federal IT systems . While the government has acted to protect federal information systems, agencies need to improve security programs, cyber capabilities, and the protection of personally identifiable information. Over the last several years, GAO has made about 2,700 recommendations to agencies aimed at improving the security of federal systems and information. These recommendations identified actions for agencies to take to strengthen their information security programs and technical controls over their computer networks and systems. As of May 2018, about 800 of the information security-related recommendations had not been implemented. From fiscal years 2010 through 2015, GAO made about 800 recommendations to OMB and federal agencies to address shortcomings in IT acquisitions and operations. Since 2010, GAO also made about 2,700 recommendations to federal agencies to improve the security of federal systems. These recommendations include those to improve the implementation of CIO responsibilities, the oversight of the data center consolidation initiative, software license management efforts, and the strength of security programs and technical controls. Most agencies agreed with these recommendations, and GAO will continue to monitor their implementation."], "length": 25526}

The block grant amount has not been adjusted for inflation since FY2017, leading to a 36% decrease in real value from its initial value in FY1997. TANF funds are used for various purposes, including basic assistance, child care, work-related activities, and refundable tax credits. In FY2017, 1.2 million families, comprising 3.1 million recipients, received TANF or MOE-funded assistance, with the majority being children. The composition of the assistance caseload has shifted over time, with a significant decline in families headed by unemployed adults and an increase in families with employed adults and \"child-only\" families. The maximum monthly TANF cash benefit varies widely across states, ranging from $170 in Mississippi to $1,201 in New Hampshire. The TANF work participation standards, which require 50% of the caseload to participate in work or activities, have been met by most states, with the exception of Nevada and Guam in FY2017. The work participation standards for the two-parent portion of the caseload are 90%, which can be reduced by caseload reduction. The effectiveness of the work participation standards has been measured through work participation rates, which have increased since FY2011, largely due to the creation of \"earnings supplement\" programs. The TANF block grant has faced challenges in maintaining its real value and ensuring adequate funding for assistance and services to needy families. The passage highlights the importance of understanding the allocation and utilization of TANF funds to address the evolving needs of families receiving assistance. The data presented underscores the need for continued monitoring and adjustment of TANF policies to ensure they effectively support families in achieving self-sufficiency. The report emphasizes the significance of TANF in providing essential support to families and the critical role of work requirements in promoting self-sufficiency. The unique aspect of the report is its detailed analysis of the changing composition of the TANF caseload and the impact of various policy changes on the effectiveness of TANF programs. The summary effectively captures the main arguments, key evidence, and unique insights from the passage", "answers": ["The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant funds a wide range of benefits and services for low-income families with children. TANF was created in the 1996 welfare reform law (P.L. 104-193). This report responds to some frequently asked questions about TANF; it does not describe TANF rules (see, instead, CRS Report RL32748, The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Block Grant: A Primer on TANF Financing and Federal Requirements, by Gene Falk). TANF Funding and Expenditures. TANF provides fixed funding for the 50 states, the District of Columbia, the territories, and American Indian tribes. The basic block grant totals $16.5 billion per year. States are also required in total to contribute, from their own funds, at least $10.3 billion annually under a maintenance-of-effort (MOE) requirement. Though TANF is best known for funding cash assistance payments for needy families with children, the block grant and MOE funds are used for a wide variety of benefits and activities. In FY2017, expenditures on basic assistance totaled $7.1 billion—23% of total federal TANF and MOE dollars. Basic assistance is often—but not exclusively—paid as cash. In addition to funding basic assistance, TANF also contributes funds for child care and services for children who have been, or are at risk of being, abused and neglected. Some states also count expenditures in prekindergarten programs toward the MOE requirement. The TANF Assistance Caseload. A total of 1.2 million families, composed of 3.1 million recipients, received TANF- or MOE-funded assistance in September 2018. The bulk of the \"recipients\" were children—2.3 million in that month. The assistance caseload is heterogeneous. The type of family once thought of as the \"typical\" assistance family—one with an unemployed adult recipient—accounted for 32% of all families on the rolls in FY2016. Additionally, 31% of cash assistance families had an employed adult, while 38% of all TANF families were \"child-only\" and had no adult recipient. Child-only families include those with disabled adults receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI), adults who are nonparents (e.g., grandparents, aunts, uncles) caring for children, and families consisting of citizen children and ineligible noncitizen parents. Cash Assistance Benefits. TANF cash benefit amounts are set by states. In July 2017, the maximum monthly benefit for a family of three ranged from $1,021 in New Hampshire to $170 in Mississippi. Only New Hampshire (at 60% of the federal poverty guidelines) had a maximum TANF cash assistance amount for this sized family in excess of 50% of poverty-level income. Work Requirements. TANF's main federal work requirement is actually a performance measure that applies to the states. States determine the work rules that apply to individual recipients. TANF law requires states to engage 50% of all families and 90% of two-parent families with work-eligible individuals in work activities, though these standards can be reduced by \"credits.\" Therefore, the effective standards states face are often less than the 50% or 90% targets, and vary by state. In FY2017, states achieved, on average, an all-family participation rate of 53.0% and a two-parent rate of 69.5%. In FY2017, two jurisdictions did not meet the all-family participation standard: Nevada and Guam. This is a reduction from FY2012, when 16 states did not meet that standard. In FY2017, nine jurisdictions did not meet the two-parent standard. States that do not meet work standards are at risk of being penalized by a reduction in their block grant."], "length": 26224}
{"pred": " \n\nPassage 1 discusses the federal government's efforts to manage its real property, particularly focusing on the Reduce the Footprint (RTF) policy. The policy aims to reduce the size of the federal real property portfolio by freezing and then reducing the footprint of office and warehouse space. Key approaches include consolidation, co-location, disposition of unneeded space, better utilization of existing space, and teleworking and hoteling. Challenges include space reduction costs, mission delivery requirements, employee organization concerns, and workload growth. The policy has led to some reductions in space, but agencies face difficulties in achieving their targets due to various factors. GSA plays a crucial role in managing vacated space, aiming to minimize vacant space and maximize cost savings. The report highlights the need for better data collection and transparency to improve program integrity in Medicaid managed care, as the current Payment Error Rate Measurement (PERM) likely underestimates risks. The PERM does not account for overpayments and unallowable costs, which are significant issues in managed care. Despite CMS efforts to strengthen oversight, including updated regulations and collaborative audits, the limitations of the PERM remain a concern. The report recommends that CMS consider revising the PERM methodology or focusing additional audit resources on managed care to better measure program risks. Key evidence includes the PERM methodology, HHS-OIG compliance reviews, and findings from audits and investigations of Medicaid managed care organizations. Unique points include the emphasis on the limitations of the PERM in capturing program integrity risks and the need for better stakeholder engagement in facility alignment efforts. The report also highlights the challenges faced by agencies in achieving their RTF targets and the importance of transparent data in Medicaid program integrity. The summary focuses on the main arguments, key evidence, and unique points from the passage, providing a concise overview of the federal government's real property management and Medicaid program integrity efforts. The report underscores the need for improved data collection, stakeholder engagement, and methodological adjustments to better address program risks and ensure the integrity of federal real property and Medicaid managed care programs.

GSA provides space for agencies in government-owned and commercially leased buildings. In 2015, the OMB issued a memorandum requiring the 24 agencies with chief financial officers to reduce their domestic office and warehouse space. These agencies are required to set annual reduction targets for a 5-year time period and update their real property plans annually. GAO was asked to review the implementation of this space reduction initiative. This report discusses: (1) the approaches and any challenges the 24 agencies identified to achieving their reduction targets for all their domestic office and warehouse space; (2) the extent these agencies reduced their space and met their fiscal year 2016 targets; and (3) how GSA manages vacated space it had leased to these agencies. GAO conducted a content analysis of the 24 agencies' real property plans for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 and analyzed agencies' data as submitted to GSA on their targets and reductions for fiscal year 2016, the only year for which data were available. GAO selected five agencies as case studies based on several factors, including size of the agencies' office and warehouse portfolio, agency reduction targets, and fiscal year 2016 reported reductions. GAO reviewed relevant documentation and interviewed officials from GSA, OMB, and GAO's case study agencies. GAO provided a draft of this product to GSA, OMB, and our case study agencies for comment. GAO incorporated technical comments, as appropriate. Most of the 24 agencies with chief financial officers reported to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the General Services Administration (GSA) that they planned to consolidate their office and warehouse space and allocate fewer square feet per employee as the key ways to achieve their space reduction targets. For example, the Department of Agriculture reported it will consolidate staff from five component agencies in two office buildings. When complete, the space allocated per employee will average about 250 square feet down from a high of 420 square feet per employee. In taking these actions, the agencies most often identified the cost of space reduction projects as a challenge to achieving their targets. Agencies cited costs such as for space renovations to accommodate more staff and required environmental clean-up before disposing of property as challenges to completing projects. Some agencies required to maintain offices across the country reported that their mission requirements limit their ability to reduce their space. In fiscal year 2016, 17 of the 24 agencies reported they reduced their space, but had varying success achieving their first-year targets. Of the 17 agencies, 9 exceeded their target and reduced more space than planned, 7 missed their target (by anywhere between 2.8 and 96.7 percent), and 1 reduced space, despite a targeted increase. Agency officials said that it is not unusual for projects to shift to different years and that such shifts could lead to missing targets one year and exceeding them the next. GSA has processes to manage the space vacated by agencies that is leased through GSA. For example, starting in November 2016, GSA started tracking agencies' space release requests centrally to help standardize the process and established an e-mail address to which agencies can submit requests. GSA relies on regional offices to manage real property in their regions and to identify tenants for vacant space or to remove unused space from the inventory. GSA's regional officials said regular monitoring and coordinating with agencies minimizes the likelihood GSA is caught off guard by a return of space. These processes also help them to plan ahead. GSA met its 2016 performance goal to have an annual vacant space rate of no more than 3.2 percent in its federally owned and leased buildings. However, given the recent implementation of the space reduction initiative, it is too early to determine the extent to which agencies will return space to GSA prior to the end of their leases and the effect on GSA's inventory."], "length": 27519}

It notes that many employees change jobs frequently, which can lead to early withdrawals and the loss of compounded interest. The passage also mentions that some employers provide financial wellness programs to help employees manage their retirement savings. Additionally, it discusses the incidence and amount of early withdrawals from IRAs and 401(k) plans, highlighting that many individuals withdraw money early due to financial needs, and that these withdrawals can have long-term negative impacts on retirement savings. The passage concludes by noting that while some strategies exist to reduce early withdrawals, more data is needed to better understand the issue. Key evidence includes statistics on the number of DB and DC plans, the percentage of households owning IRAs, and the incidence and amount of early withdrawals. Unique points include the discussion of loan repayment policies and the potential impact of plan rules on account balances at job separation.

In 2017, U.S. plans and IRAs reportedly held investments worth nearly $17 trillion dollars. Federal law also allows individuals to withdraw assets from these accounts under certain circumstances. DOL and IRS oversee 401(k) plans, and collect annual plan data—including financial information—on the Form 5500. For both IRAs and 401(k) plans, GAO was asked to examine: (1) the incidence and amount of early withdrawals; (2) factors that might lead individuals to access retirement savings early; and (3) policies and strategies that might reduce the incidence and amounts of early withdrawals. To answer these questions, GAO analyzed data from IRS, the Census Bureau, and DOL from 2013 (the most recent complete data available); and interviewed a diverse range of stakeholders identified in the literature, including representatives of companies sponsoring 401(k) plans, plan administrators, subject matter experts, industry representatives, and participant advocates. In 2013 individuals in their prime working years (ages 25 to 55) removed at least $69 billion (+/- $3.5 billion) of their retirement savings early, according to GAO's analysis of 2013 Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Department of Labor (DOL) data. Withdrawals from individual retirement accounts (IRA)—$39.5 billion (+/- $2.1 billion)—accounted for much of the money removed early, were equivalent to 3 percent (+/- 0.15 percent) of the age group's total IRA assets, and exceeded their IRA contributions in 2013. Participants in employer-sponsored plans, like 401(k) plans, withdrew at least $29.2 billion (+/- $2.8 billion) early as hardship withdrawals, lump sum payments made at job separation (known as cashouts), and loan balances that borrowers did not repay. Hardship withdrawals in 2013 were equivalent to about 0.5 percent (+/-0.06 percent) of the age group's total plan assets and about 8 percent (+/- 0.9 percent) of their contributions. However, the incidence and amount of certain unrepaid plan loans cannot be determined because the Form 5500—the federal government's primary source of information on employee benefit plans—does not capture these data. Stakeholders GAO interviewed identified flexibilities in plan rules and individuals' pressing financial needs, such as out-of-pocket medical costs, as factors affecting early withdrawals of retirement savings. Stakeholders said that certain plan rules, such as setting high minimum loan thresholds, may cause individuals to take out more of their savings than they need. Stakeholders also identified several elements of the job separation process affecting early withdrawals, such as difficulties transferring account balances to a new plan and plans requiring the immediate repayment of outstanding loans, as relevant factors. Stakeholders GAO interviewed suggested strategies they believed could balance early access to accounts with the need to build long-term retirement savings. For example, plan sponsors said allowing individuals to continue to repay plan loans after job separation, restricting participant access to plan sponsor contributions, allowing partial distributions at job separation, and building emergency savings features into plan designs, could help preserve retirement savings (see figure). However, they noted, each strategy involves tradeoffs, and the strategies' broader implications require further study.

The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care. For example, GAO found that after one VAMC failed to report to the NPDB or SLBs a provider who resigned to avoid an adverse privileging action, a non-VA hospital in the same city took an adverse privileging action against that same provider for the same reason 2 years later."], "length": 28268}
{"pred": " \n\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) and the judiciary play crucial roles in requesting, collecting, and managing restitution for victims of federal crimes. DOJ components, including the Criminal Division, USAOs, and the Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, are responsible for identifying victims, determining their losses, and negotiating restitution terms. The judiciary, represented by federal district courts, orders restitution, prepares presentence investigation reports, and ensures offenders comply with restitution terms. Key practices recommended by DOJ to ensure full and timely restitution include coordination between prosecutors and case investigators, ensuring courts order restitution immediately, and using collection methods like the Treasury Offset Program and wage garnishment. Despite these efforts, a significant portion of restitution debt remains uncollected, with many offenders lacking the ability to pay. DOJ has identified improving debt collection as a major management initiative but lacks performance measures or goals to assess its progress. Additionally, while DOJ encourages the use of forfeited assets to compensate victims, it does not have a clear process to track the extent to which these assets are used for this purpose. The judiciary and DOJ face challenges in ensuring consistent and transparent collection of restitution, and there is a need for improved oversight and performance metrics to address these issues. Key evidence includes data showing that 15% of federal offenders ordered restitution, with $33.9 billion in restitution ordered from 2014 to 2016, and $110 billion in outstanding restitution debt. Unique points include the emphasis on coordination and communication between various units within USAOs and the judiciary, as well as the recommendation for DOJ to develop performance measures and goals to assess its progress in collecting restitution. The summary highlights the critical roles of DOJ and the judiciary in managing restitution, the effectiveness of certain practices, and the challenges in collecting restitution, particularly from offenders who lack the ability to pay. It also underscores the need for improved oversight and performance metrics to address these issues.

Various entities within the federal government are involved in the process of requesting, ordering, and collecting restitution for crime victims, including DOJ and the judiciary. The Justice for All Reauthorization Act of 2016 includes a provision for GAO to review the federal criminal restitution process for fiscal years 2014 through 2016. This report addresses, among other things: (1) the extent to which information is available on restitution requested by DOJ and ordered by courts; (2) the amount of restitution debt DOJ collected and the amount that remains outstanding; and, (3) the extent to which DOJ has conducted oversight on the collection of restitution. GAO analyzed laws, policies and procedures as well as USSC data on restitution orders and DOJ data on restitution collected from fiscal years 2014 through 2016. GAO also selected a non-generalizable sample of six federal judicial districts based on restitution collections and spoke with USAO officials and federal probation officers. Officials from selected U.S. Attorney's Offices (USAO) stated that they document requests for restitution in case files and employ other internal controls, such as the use of templates and forms, throughout the prosecution process to ensure that prosecutors request restitution as appropriate. GAO's analysis of U.S. Sentencing Commission (USSC) data—an agency within the judiciary—showed that information on restitution orders was available for 95 percent of all offenders sentenced from fiscal years 2014 through 2016. Specifically, 214,578 federal offenders were sentenced during this time period and restitution was ordered for 33,158, or 15 percent, of those offenders. Collectively, courts ordered these offenders to pay $33.9 billion in restitution. Most federal offenders sentenced during these years were sentenced for immigration or drug-related offenses. In interviews, USAO officials stated that these offenses do not typically have victims requiring restitution. GAO found that data on reasons why restitution was not ordered were incomplete for 5 percent of all offenders sentenced from fiscal years 2014 through 2016. Determining why data on restitution orders are incomplete may inform the judiciary of the cause of the incomplete data and any efforts needed to improve USSC data. GAO's analysis of Department of Justice (DOJ) data showed that USAOs collected $2.95 billion in restitution debt in fiscal years 2014 through 2016, see figure below. However, at the end of fiscal year 2016, $110 billion in previously ordered restitution remained outstanding, and USAOs identified $100 billion of that outstanding debt as uncollectible due to offenders' inability to pay. DOJ identified improving debt collection—including restitution—as a major management initiative in its 2014-2018 Strategic Plan. While DOJ is developing analytical tools to monitor the collection of restitution, it has not established performance measures or goals. Performance measures and goals would allow DOJ to gauge USAOs' success in collecting restitution and, by extension, the department's success in achieving a major management initiative. GAO is making three recommendations. GAO is making one to the judiciary to determine why data on restitution orders are incomplete. GAO is making two recommendations to DOJ, including one to implement performance measures and goals for the collection of restitution. The judiciary and DOJ concurred with the recommendations."], "length": 26679}
