It is divided into two geographic areas, nine districts, and 37 sectors. The Coast Guard is responsible for 11 statutory missions, including marine safety, which involves safety inspections and vessel accident investigations, particularly for commercial fishing vessels, an industry with one of the highest death rates. The Coast Guard sets performance targets for each mission, aiming to address gaps and implement corrective actions. However, the Coast Guard faces challenges in setting realistic asset performance data and reliable performance goals. For instance, the Coast Guard's data on commercial fishing vessel incidents is incomplete, making it difficult to calculate vessel safety statistics. Additionally, the Coast Guard's strategic asset allocations are based on unrealistic assumptions, and its performance goals may not accurately represent the Coast Guard's performance due to underreporting of recreational boating injuries. The Coast Guard is working on improving data collection and transparency, but more action is needed to address these issues. The Coast Guard is also modernizing its assets, such as acquiring new vessels, but affordability remains a concern. The Coast Guard's efforts to improve performance management and data transparency are ongoing, with some progress made but more work required to fully address the identified limitations. The passage highlights the complexity of managing a large organization with diverse missions and the importance of accurate data and realistic goals for effective performance assessment and asset management. The Coast Guard is taking steps to address these challenges, but continued efforts are necessary to ensure the organization meets its statutory missions effectively. The Coast Guard's performance assessment process includes setting targets for the current and subsequent fiscal years, with some targets derived from external factors such as requirements from the Department of Homeland Security. The Coast Guard is also working on a 20-year plan to identify necessary recapitalization efforts and fiscal resources needed to complete them, addressing the challenge of long-term planning and affordability. The passage emphasizes the need for comprehensive and transparent data management and strategic planning to support the Coast Guard's mission effectiveness. The Coast Guard is making progress in addressing data limitations and transparency issues, but more work is needed to ensure the accuracy and reliability of its performance data and goals.

To ensure that the Coast Guard is effectively fulfilling its missions, agency managers must have accurate information and base decisions on sound analyses for effective program management. This statement discusses Coast Guard actions needed to (1) improve the quality of data used for program management and (2) improve the transparency of its data for reporting on mission performance and planning. This statement is based on relevant products GAO issued from June 2014 through December 2017 on Coast Guard strategic planning and management issues, as well as related recommendation follow-up conducted through February 2018. GAO reviewed applicable laws, regulations, policies and guidance. GAO also interviewed Coast Guard officials responsible for administering these programs and obtained information on how they used data to inform decisionmaking. GAO interviewed a range of stakeholders, including federal and industry officials. GAO's prior work recommended multiple actions to improve the Coast Guard's program management by improving the quality of data it uses to manage and report on its mission performance. Specifically, GAO recommended actions such as collecting more complete data and clarifying the data limitations to facilitate more effective program management. For example, in December 2017, GAO found that more information is needed to calculate vessel safety statistics that could enhance the Coast Guard's knowledge about accident, injury, and fatality trends involving commercial fishing vessels. Having more complete information could be useful to carrying out its marine safety mission, and GAO recommended, among other things, that the Coast Guard ensure that data collected during commercial fishing vessel incident investigations is accurately captured. In 2018, the Coast Guard reported taking initial steps to capture more accurate data. GAO's prior work also identified areas where the Coast Guard could improve the transparency of the data it uses for reporting on its mission performance as well its capital planning purposes. For example, in an October 2017 report on performance goals, GAO found the Coast Guard's Annual Performance Report (APR) has not been released publicly since 2011. Consequently, there has not been full visibility over performance across all of the Coast Guard's missions. Coast Guard officials stated that a decision by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) leadership to limit the number of performance goals shared publicly had deterred the Coast Guard from public release of its APR. GAO recommended that APRs be available on the Coast Guard's website; the Coast Guard plans to publicly release future APRs. In addition, previous GAO reports found that the Coast Guard's annual 5-year capital investment plan, which projects acquisition funding needs for the upcoming 5 years, did not consistently reflect current total cost estimates or the effects of tradeoffs made as part of the annual budget cycle. GAO made recommendations to help the Coast Guard plan for future acquisitions and the difficult trade off decisions it will face given funding constraints. The Coast Guard agreed, but it is unclear when it will complete the 20-year plan. GAO is not making new recommendations in this statement but has made them to the Coast Guard and DHS in the past on improving its program management through, among other things, better quality and more transparent data.

{"pred": " \n\nPassage 1 focuses on the Drug Enforcement Administration's (DEA) role in regulating the disposal of unused prescription drugs and the challenges faced by pharmacies and other eligible entities in becoming authorized collectors. The DEA administers the Controlled Substances Act, which requires entities that manufacture, distribute, or dispense controlled substances to register with the agency. In 2010, the Disposal Act amended the Controlled Substances Act to allow the public to safely dispose of unused controlled substances through various methods, including disposal bins, mail-back programs, and take-back events. DEA regulations outline the requirements for authorized collectors, such as installing and maintaining secure disposal bins, destroying collected substances in compliance with federal, state, and local laws, and maintaining records for two years. As of April 2017, only about 2.5% of eligible entities had registered to use disposal bins, with pharmacies being the most common authorized collectors. Factors influencing low participation include costs, uncertainty over compliance with regulations, and the availability of alternative disposal options. Despite these challenges, about half of the country's population lived within 5 miles of a disposal bin as of April 2017. The passage highlights the complexity of implementing the Disposal Act and the ongoing efforts by the DEA to improve communication and guidance to stakeholders. Key evidence includes the low participation rates and the various reasons stakeholders provided for not participating, such as costs and uncertainty over compliance. Unique points include the DEA's responsibility to provide guidance and the potential for future developments in destruction methods that meet the non-retrievable standard. The passage concludes with a note that the report was provided to the Department of Justice for comment and will be available on the GAO website. The summary emphasizes the regulatory framework, challenges, and ongoing efforts to improve the system for disposing of unused prescription drugs. The data on participation rates and the availability of disposal bins provide critical context for understanding the effectiveness of the current system. The passage also underscores the importance of clear communication and guidance from the DEA to ensure successful implementation of the Disposal Act. The summary concludes by noting the potential for future improvements in destruction methods and the ongoing efforts to address the challenges facing authorized collectors. The DEA's role in ensuring the availability of controlled substances for legitimate uses while preventing their diversion is central to the passage, highlighting the balance between accessibility and security in the management of prescription drugs. The summary aims to capture the essence of the DEA's regulatory framework, the challenges faced by authorized collectors, and the ongoing efforts to improve the system for disposing of unused prescription", "answers": ["In 2015, 3.8 million Americans reported misusing prescription drugs within the last month, and deaths from prescription opioids have more than quadrupled since 1999. About half of the people who reported misusing prescription drugs in 2015 received them from a friend or relative. One way to help prevent this kind of diversion and potential misuse is by providing secure and convenient ways to dispose of unused, unneeded, or expired prescription medications. The Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010 authorizes pharmacies and other entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances to also collect unused prescription drugs for disposal. In 2014, DEA finalized regulations for the implementation of the Act, establishing a voluntary process for eligible entities to become authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs using disposal bins. GAO was asked to review participation among authorized collectors that maintain disposal bins. In this report GAO describes (1) participation rates among entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs and (2) factors that affect participation. GAO analyzed the most currently available DEA data from April 2017 on entities eligible to participate and those participating as authorized collectors. GAO also conducted interviews with DEA officials and a nongeneralizable sample of 11 stakeholder organizations selected to illustrate different types of authorized collectors and long-term care facilities. GAO is not making any recommendations. DEA provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. GAO found that about 3 percent of pharmacies and other entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs for disposal have volunteered to do so. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) authorizes these entities to dispose of unused drugs to help reduce their potential misuse. Analysis of DEA data shows that as of April 2017, 2,233 of the 89,550 (2.49 percent) eligible entities—that is, certain entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances—had registered with DEA to use disposal bins to collect unused prescription drugs. Most—about 81 percent—of the authorized collectors were pharmacies, followed by hospitals or clinics. GAO also found that participation rates varied by state, though in 44 states less than 5 percent of the state's pharmacies and other eligible entities had registered to become authorized collectors. Stakeholders cited several factors that may explain why relatively few pharmacies and other eligible entities have registered with DEA as authorized collectors of unused drugs. Most notably, stakeholders representing authorized collectors told GAO that because participation is voluntary, the cost associated with maintaining a disposal bin—which includes purchasing and installing the bin according to DEA requirements and paying for the destruction of its contents—is an important factor to weigh against potential benefits. DEA noted that availability of disposal by law enforcement agencies also contributes to low participation."], "length": 6849}

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (VAMC) officials are responsible for reviewing the clinical care delivered by their privileged providers—physicians and dentists who are approved to independently perform specific services—after concerns are raised. The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care.

Elections are primarily administered by thousands of state and local systems rather than a single, unified national system. States and localities share responsibility for most election administration duties. Exactly how responsibilities are assigned at the state and local levels varies both between and within states, but there are some general patterns in the distribution of duties. States typically have primary responsibility for making decisions about the rules of elections (policymaking). Localities typically have primary responsibility for conducting elections in accordance with those rules (implementation). Localities, with varying contributions from states, typically also have primary responsibility for paying for the activities and resources required to conduct elections (funding). The structures of the state and local systems that conduct elections also vary between and within states. Common variations include differences related to the leadership of the system, the relationship between local election officials and the state, and the population size and density of the jurisdiction the system serves. The leadership of a state or local election system may be elected or appointed, and both the leaders and the methods used to select them may be partisan, bipartisan, or nonpartisan. State officials may have more or less direct influence over local election officials, and the extent of their influence may be affected by other structural features of the state's election systems, such as the methods used to select local officials. Finally, larger election jurisdictions have different administrative advantages and challenges than smaller ones, and more urban jurisdictions have different advantages and challenges than more rural ones. These differences between jurisdictions may be reflected in structural features of the election systems that serve them, such as how the systems allocate resources and where they find specialized expertise. Understanding the duties and structures of state and local election systems may be relevant to Congress for at least two reasons. First, the way state and local election systems work can affect how well federal action on election administration serves its intended purposes. The effectiveness of federal action depends in part on how it is implemented. How it is implemented can depend, in turn, on how the state and local election systems that implement it work. Second, Congress can make or incentivize changes to the way state and local election systems work. Congress has a number of policy tools it can use to affect the administration of federal elections.

The current missions include a counterterrorism mission led by the US and a NATO-led Resolute Support mission aimed at establishing self-sustaining Afghan security forces. Despite improvements, the ANDSF (Afghan National Defense and Security Forces) still faces significant capability gaps, particularly in conventional forces, which make up about 75% of the ANDSF. The ANDSF's ability to operate and maintain U.S.-purchased equipment is limited, especially for conventional forces, due to a lack of embedded advisors at the tactical level. The ANDSF has improved in some areas like operational planning and coordination, but still relies heavily on coalition support. Key equipment includes MD-530 helicopters, Mobile Strike Force Vehicles (MSFVs), and radios. The ANDSF's capability gaps and reliance on coalition support highlight the ongoing challenges in developing a self-sustaining ANDSF. The Department of Defense (DOD) should develop and implement methods to collect reliable information on the ANDSF's ability to operate and maintain U.S.-purchased equipment, as this is crucial for evaluating the success of training and support efforts.

This report addresses (1) what has been reported about ANDSF capabilities and capability gaps and (2) the extent to which DOD has information about the ANDSF's ability to operate and maintain U.S.-purchased equipment. To conduct this work, GAO analyzed DOD and NATO reports and documents, examined three critical equipment types, and interviewed DOD officials in the United States and Afghanistan. This is a public version of a sensitive report issued in September 2018. Information that DOD deemed sensitive has been omitted. Since the Resolute Support mission began in 2015, the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) have improved some fundamental capabilities, such as high-level operational planning, but continue to rely on U.S. and coalition support to fill several key capability gaps, according to Department of Defense (DOD) reporting. DOD has initiatives to address some ANDSF capability gaps, such as a country-wide vehicle maintenance and training effort, but DOD reports it does not expect the ANDSF to develop and sustain independent capabilities in some areas, such as logistics, for several years. While DOD has firsthand information on the abilities of the Afghan Air Force and Special Security Forces to operate and maintain U.S.-purchased equipment, it has little reliable information on the equipment proficiency of conventional ANDSF units. U.S. and coalition advisors are embedded at the tactical level for the Air Force and Special Security Forces, enabling DOD to directly assess those forces' abilities. However, the advisors have little direct contact with conventional ANDSF units on the front lines. As a result, DOD relies on those units' self-assessments of tactical abilities, which, according to DOD officials, can be unreliable. GAO's analysis of three critical equipment types illustrated the varying degrees of DOD's information (see figure above). For example, DOD provided detailed information about the Air Force's ability to operate and maintain MD-530 helicopters and the Special Security Forces' ability to operate and maintain Mobile Strike Force Vehicles; however, DOD had limited information about how conventional forces operate and maintain radios and Mobile Strike Force Vehicles. DOD's lack of reliable information on conventional forces' equipment operations and maintenance abilities adds to the uncertainty and risk in assessing the progress of DOD efforts in Afghanistan.

{"pred": " \n\nThe passage discusses the effects of radiation exposure, particularly low-dose radiation, and the approach taken by federal agencies to protect against its risks. Higher radiation doses can cause immediate effects such as acute radiation syndrome, while lower doses are harder to detect. Federal agencies, including the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of Energy (DOE), and Food and Drug Administration (FDA), rely on scientific advisory bodies to set radiation protection requirements and guidance. They use the linear no-threshold model, which assumes that cancer risk increases with every incremental increase in radiation exposure, even at low doses. Despite uncertainties in estimating cancer risks from very low doses, agencies continue to follow this model. The passage also notes that federal agencies have decreased funding for research on the health effects of low-dose radiation over the past five years, with the Department of Energy (DOE) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) accounting for most of the funding. While some collaboration exists among agencies for specific projects, there is no overarching mechanism to address overall research priorities. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommends that the Department of Energy (DOE) lead the development of such a mechanism to ensure coordinated efforts in this area. The GAO believes that DOE is well-positioned to take this role due to its historical involvement in radiation research and its primary responsibility under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 for protecting health during activities that can result in radiation exposure. The passage concludes by noting that while agencies have legal mandates and budget authorities, a collaborative mechanism could help them better address shared research priorities. The GAO's recommendation aims to enhance interagency cooperation and improve the accuracy of predictions about cancer risks from low-dose radiation exposure. The summary highlights the current practices of federal agencies in managing radiation risks, the challenges in researching low-dose radiation effects, and the proposed solution to improve interagency collaboration. Key evidence includes the reliance on the linear no-threshold model and the decreasing funding for relevant research. Unique points include the suggestion that DOE should lead the development of a collaborative mechanism for addressing research priorities in this field. The summary focuses on the main arguments, key evidence, and innovative points without delving into less critical details. The passage emphasizes the importance of continued research and collaboration to better understand and mitigate the health impacts of low-dose radiation exposure. The summary effectively captures the essence of the passage, highlighting the current state of radiation protection and the proposed improvements in research and collaboration. The summary is concise and focused on the most critical", "answers": ["This testimony summarizes the information contained in GAO's September 2017 report, entitled Low-Dose Radiation: Interagency Collaboration on Planning Research Could Improve Information on Health Effects ( GAO-17-546 ). The Department of Energy (DOE), Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Food and Drug Administration generally used the advice of scientific advisory bodies to develop and apply radiation protection requirements and guidance for workers and the public in the radiation exposure settings that GAO reviewed. These settings were: (1) the operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants; (2) the cleanup of sites with radiological contamination; (3) the use of medical equipment that produces radiation; and (4) accidental or terrorism-related exposure to radiation. Specifically, the agencies relied on the advice of three scientific advisory bodies that supported the use of a model that assumes the risk of cancer increases with every incremental radiation exposure. Accordingly, the agencies have set regulatory dose limits and issued guidance to confine exposure to levels that reduce the risk of cancer, while recognizing that scientific uncertainties occur in estimating cancer risks from low-dose radiation. For example, NRC requires nuclear power plants to consider measures for limiting workers' exposure below NRC's regulatory dose limit, such as by using robots for maintenance work in radiation areas. GAO identified seven federal agencies that funded research on low-dose radiation's health effects. In fiscal years 2012 to 2016, DOE, NRC, EPA, and four other federal agencies obligated about $210 million for such research . Although the agencies have collaborated on individual projects on radiation's health effects, they have not established a collaborative mechanism to set research priorities. GAO's previous work has shown that federal agencies can use such mechanisms to implement interagency collaboration to develop and coordinate sound science policies. In the past, DOE took a leading role in this area because DOE provided stable funding and advocated for greater coordination on research on low-dose radiation's health effects. However, since fiscal year 2012, DOE has phased out funding for one of its main research programs in this area. This has created a void in coordination efforts among federal agencies, and no other agency has stepped forward to fill this void. Because of DOE's prior experience as a leader in this area of research and its research responsibility under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, it could play an important role in helping federal agencies establish a coordinating mechanism for low-dose radiation research.

Shared U.S.-Israel concerns about Iran and its allies on the nuclear issue and in Syria and Lebanon. Israeli-Palestinian issues. Israeli domestic political issues, including elections scheduled for 2019. Israel relies on a number of strengths to manage potential threats to its security and existence. It maintains conventional military superiority relative to neighboring states and the Palestinians. It also takes measures to deter attack and defend its population and borders from evolving asymmetric threats such as rockets and missiles, cross-border tunneling, drones, and cyberattacks. Additionally, Israel has an undeclared but presumed nuclear weapons capability. Against a backdrop of strong bilateral cooperation, Israel's leaders and supporters routinely make the case that Israel's security and the broader stability of the region remain critically important for U.S. interests. A 10-year bilateral military aid memorandum of understanding (MOU)—signed in 2016—commits the United States to provide Israel $3.3 billion in Foreign Military Financing annually from FY2019 to FY2028, along with additional amounts from Defense Department accounts for missile defense. All of these amounts remain subject to congressional appropriations. Israeli officials seek to counter Iranian regional influence and prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu released new Israeli intelligence on Iran's nuclear program in April 2018, days before President Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 international agreement that constrains Iran's nuclear activities. It is unclear whether Israel might take future military action in Iran if Iranian nuclear activities resume. Since 2018, Israel has conducted a number of military operations in Syria against Iran and its allies, including Lebanese Hezbollah. Israel and Iran also appear to be competing for military advantage over each other at the Israel-Lebanon border. Amid uncertainty in the area, in March 2019 President Trump recognized Israel's claim to sovereignty over the Golan Heights, changing long-standing U.S. policy that held—in line with U.N. Security Council Resolution 497 from 1981—the Golan was occupied Syrian territory whose final status was subject to Israel-Syria negotiation. The prospects for an Israeli-Palestinian peace process are complicated by many factors. Palestinian leaders cut off high-level political contacts with the Trump Administration after it recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital in December 2017. U.S.-Palestinian tensions have since worsened amid U.S. cutoffs of funding to the Palestinians and diplomatic moves—including the May 2018 opening of the U.S. embassy to Israel in Jerusalem. Palestinian leaders interpreted these actions as prejudicing their claims to a capital in Jerusalem and to a just resolution of Palestinian refugee claims. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has welcomed these U.S. actions. The Trump Administration has suggested that it will release a proposed peace plan after Israeli elections, which are scheduled for April 9, 2019. Speculation continues about how warming ties between Israel and Arab Gulf states may affect Israeli-Palestinian diplomacy, though Saudi Arabia said that the U.S. policy change on the Golan Heights would negatively affect the peace process. Bouts of tension and violence between Israel and Hamas in Gaza have continued—reportedly accompanied by indirect talks between the two parties that are being brokered by Egypt and aim for a long-term cease-fire. Domestically, Israel is preparing for the April 9 elections, which are closely contested.

Initially, the U.S. provided logistical and intelligence support without direct military engagement. However, as the conflict escalated and humanitarian crises worsened, Congress became increasingly critical of U.S. support for the coalition. Key events included the introduction of resolutions to limit arms sales to Saudi Arabia, debates over the War Powers Resolution, and the eventual imposition of conditions on U.S. support for coalition operations. The passage highlights the tension between maintaining U.S.-Saudi relations and addressing human rights concerns and humanitarian needs in Yemen. Notably, the U.S. took steps to limit its involvement, such as suspending the transfer of precision munitions and reducing intelligence sharing, but continued to support counterterrorism efforts. The conflict's duration and the humanitarian crisis it caused led to growing congressional scrutiny and calls for a more robust response, culminating in the passage of legislation that imposed conditions on U.S. support for the coalition. The passage concludes by noting that while the U.S. may no longer be directly involved in the conflict, the humanitarian situation in Yemen remains dire, suggesting ongoing challenges for U.S. policymakers.

Executive branch agencies are required to annually estimate improper payments for certain programs. Estimation of improper payments is key to understanding the extent of the problem and to developing effective corrective actions. Relevant laws and guidance provide agencies flexibility in developing estimates. This report describes agencies' processes to estimate improper payments in selected programs for fiscal year 2017 and the extent to which certain differences in these processes can affect the usefulness of the resulting estimates. GAO selected 10 programs across six agencies with the largest reported program outlays in fiscal years 2015 and 2016. For these programs, GAO reviewed relevant laws and guidance, analyzed agencies' policies and procedures, and interviewed officials at relevant agencies and OMB staff. The six agencies GAO reviewed reported taking various approaches related to key components of estimating improper payments—shown in the figure below—for 10 selected programs, which collectively reported outlays of over $2.5 trillion for fiscal year 2017. Sample selection. Eight of the 10 programs GAO reviewed reported using statistically valid approaches, and the remaining 2 reported using alternative methodologies approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The sampled data elements varied, including payments, medical claims, and tax returns. The age of the data used to develop fiscal year 2017 improper payment estimates also varied, ranging from calendar year 2013 to fiscal year 2017. Identification of improper payments. Some of the six agencies reported using processes designed specifically to estimate improper payments, whereas others reported leveraging existing reviews. These agencies' policies and procedures include a review of aspects of eligibility, except for those related to the Department of Defense's (DOD) Military Pay and the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) Retirement overpayments. DOD and OPM have not fully assessed whether their estimation processes effectively consider key program risks. OMB guidance does not specifically address how agencies are to test to identify improper payments, such as using a risk-based approach to help ensure that key risks of improper payments are addressed. The six agencies also varied in the treatment of insufficient documentation, both in identifying and in reporting the root causes of improper payments. For the agencies that contact entities outside the agency to estimate improper payments, the treatment of nonresponse differed, with one agency including nonresponses as improper payments and another generally excluding the nonresponse cases from review. Although OMB guidance states that agencies should treat cases of insufficient documentation as improper payments, it does not specifically address the treatment of nonresponse cases.

The six agencies generally reported using law and OMB guidance to calculate improper payment estimates for the selected programs, except for the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) removed overpayments that were recovered when developing its estimate. OMB guidance requires agencies to include recovered amounts in their estimates. Removing these overpayments understates the EITC improper payment estimate and may limit IRS's ability to develop corrective actions to prevent improper payments. GAO recommends that OMB develop guidance on treatment of nonresponse cases and testing to identify improper payments, that DOD and OPM assess their estimation processes, and that IRS revise its methodology to not exclude recovered payments from its estimate.

{"pred": " \n\nPassage 1 discusses the role of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in regulating the disposal of unused controlled substances. The DEA administers and enforces the Controlled Substances Act, which mandates that entities manufacturing, distributing, or dispensing controlled substances must register with the DEA. The Disposal Act of 2010 amended the Controlled Substances Act to allow the public to safely dispose of unused controlled substances through designated entities. DEA has implemented regulations that outline three methods for public disposal: disposal bins, mail-back programs, and take-back events. DEA's regulations specify detailed requirements for authorized collectors, including secure installation and maintenance of disposal bins, proper handling of collected substances, and documentation of activities. Despite these provisions, only a small percentage of eligible entities have chosen to become authorized collectors, primarily due to associated costs, regulatory uncertainties, and participation in other disposal efforts. The report highlights that about half of the U.S. population lives within 5 miles of a disposal bin, but access varies significantly between urban and rural areas. The DEA's role is primarily to provide the opportunity for entities to become authorized collectors, rather than actively promoting or monitoring their activities. The passage also notes that the DEA does not collect data on the extent of usage or the types of substances disposed of through the bins. Key evidence includes statistics on the number of authorized collectors and their locations, as well as stakeholder interviews highlighting the challenges and costs associated with participating in the program. Unique points include the DEA's non-retrievable standard for destruction of collected substances and the potential conflicts with other federal regulations. The report concludes by summarizing the findings and providing context for the low participation rates among eligible entities. The DEA's approach focuses on enabling participation rather than mandating it, recognizing the complexities and challenges involved in implementing the program. The report also emphasizes the importance of continued stakeholder engagement and the need for clear guidance and support to encourage broader participation. The summary concludes by noting that the DEA's responsibility is to provide the framework for disposal, leaving the actual implementation largely to the discretion of the authorized collectors. The report suggests that addressing cost concerns and providing clearer guidance could potentially increase participation in the program. The DEA's role is seen as facilitative rather than prescriptive, aiming to create a system that allows for safe and effective disposal of unused controlled substances while respecting the autonomy of participating entities. The report also highlights the variation in participation rates across states and the potential for localized solutions to address these disparities. The summary concludes by noting that while the program has the potential to significantly", "answers": ["In 2015, 3.8 million Americans reported misusing prescription drugs within the last month, and deaths from prescription opioids have more than quadrupled since 1999. About half of the people who reported misusing prescription drugs in 2015 received them from a friend or relative. One way to help prevent this kind of diversion and potential misuse is by providing secure and convenient ways to dispose of unused, unneeded, or expired prescription medications. The Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010 authorizes pharmacies and other entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances to also collect unused prescription drugs for disposal. In 2014, DEA finalized regulations for the implementation of the Act, establishing a voluntary process for eligible entities to become authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs using disposal bins. GAO was asked to review participation among authorized collectors that maintain disposal bins. In this report GAO describes (1) participation rates among entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs and (2) factors that affect participation. GAO analyzed the most currently available DEA data from April 2017 on entities eligible to participate and those participating as authorized collectors. GAO also conducted interviews with DEA officials and a nongeneralizable sample of 11 stakeholder organizations selected to illustrate different types of authorized collectors and long-term care facilities. GAO is not making any recommendations. DEA provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. GAO found that about 3 percent of pharmacies and other entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs for disposal have volunteered to do so. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) authorizes these entities to dispose of unused drugs to help reduce their potential misuse. Analysis of DEA data shows that as of April 2017, 2,233 of the 89,550 (2.49 percent) eligible entities—that is, certain entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances—had registered with DEA to use disposal bins to collect unused prescription drugs. Most—about 81 percent—of the authorized collectors were pharmacies, followed by hospitals or clinics. GAO also found that participation rates varied by state, though in 44 states less than 5 percent of the state's pharmacies and other eligible entities had registered to become authorized collectors. Stakeholders cited several factors that may explain why relatively few pharmacies and other eligible entities have registered with DEA as authorized collectors of unused drugs. Most notably, stakeholders representing authorized collectors told GAO that because participation is voluntary, the cost associated with maintaining a disposal bin—which includes purchasing and installing the bin according to DEA requirements and paying for the destruction of its contents—is an important factor to weigh against potential benefits. DEA noted that availability of disposal by law enforcement agencies also contributes to low participation."], "length": 6508}

{"pred": " \n\nPassage 2 discusses the approach federal agencies take towards regulating radiation exposure, particularly low-dose radiation. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's 2006 report on radiation and human health suggests that the risk of cancer increases with every incremental increase in radiation exposure, a concept known as the linear no-threshold model. Federal agencies like the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Department of Energy (DOE) rely on this model to set dose limits for radiation exposure. For instance, the NRC's annual dose limit for the public from nuclear power plants is significantly lower than what is considered low dose by the National Academies. The passage also notes that while the linear no-threshold model is widely accepted, there is uncertainty in estimating cancer risks from very low doses of radiation, especially when extrapolating from acute exposure data to chronic exposure scenarios. Despite this, agencies continue to use the model due to the lack of convincing evidence suggesting otherwise. Additionally, the passage highlights that federal agencies have been reducing their funding for research on the health effects of low-dose radiation, with a significant decrease observed from 2012 to 2016. The passage concludes by noting that while agencies collaborate on specific research projects, they do not have a formal mechanism to address overall research priorities in this area. The GAO recommends that the Department of Energy (DOE) lead the development of such a mechanism to enhance interagency collaboration and address shared research priorities. The recommendation is based on DOE's historical role in advocating for communication and coordination between radiation biology and epidemiology fields and its current responsibility for radiation protection under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. The GAO believes that such a mechanism could help determine roles and responsibilities among agencies and improve the overall research effort in this field. The passage emphasizes the importance of continued research to reduce uncertainties in predicting cancer risks from low-dose radiation exposure. Key evidence includes the decreasing funding trends and the need for further research highlighted in the 2016 report of DOE’s Biological and Environmental Research Advisory Committee. Unique points include the suggestion that the DOE should lead the development of a collaborative mechanism despite having a legal mandate for research, due to its historical role and expertise in this area. The passage also underscores the challenge of accurately estimating cancer risks from low-dose radiation exposure, particularly when dealing with chronic exposure scenarios. The GAO's recommendation aims to address this gap by fostering better interagency cooperation. The summary focuses on the main", "answers": ["This testimony summarizes the information contained in GAO's September 2017 report, entitled Low-Dose Radiation: Interagency Collaboration on Planning Research Could Improve Information on Health Effects ( GAO-17-546 ). The Department of Energy (DOE), Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Food and Drug Administration generally used the advice of scientific advisory bodies to develop and apply radiation protection requirements and guidance for workers and the public in the radiation exposure settings that GAO reviewed. These settings were: (1) the operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants; (2) the cleanup of sites with radiological contamination; (3) the use of medical equipment that produces radiation; and (4) accidental or terrorism-related exposure to radiation. Specifically, the agencies relied on the advice of three scientific advisory bodies that supported the use of a model that assumes the risk of cancer increases with every incremental radiation exposure. Accordingly, the agencies have set regulatory dose limits and issued guidance to confine exposure to levels that reduce the risk of cancer, while recognizing that scientific uncertainties occur in estimating cancer risks from low-dose radiation. For example, NRC requires nuclear power plants to consider measures for limiting workers' exposure below NRC's regulatory dose limit, such as by using robots for maintenance work in radiation areas. GAO identified seven federal agencies that funded research on low-dose radiation's health effects. In fiscal years 2012 to 2016, DOE, NRC, EPA, and four other federal agencies obligated about $210 million for such research . Although the agencies have collaborated on individual projects on radiation's health effects, they have not established a collaborative mechanism to set research priorities. GAO's previous work has shown that federal agencies can use such mechanisms to implement interagency collaboration to develop and coordinate sound science policies. In the past, DOE took a leading role in this area because DOE provided stable funding and advocated for greater coordination on research on low-dose radiation's health effects. However, since fiscal year 2012, DOE has phased out funding for one of its main research programs in this area. This has created a void in coordination efforts among federal agencies, and no other agency has stepped forward to fill this void. Because of DOE's prior experience as a leader in this area of research and its research responsibility under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, it could play an important role in helping federal agencies establish a coordinating mechanism for low-dose radiation research.

Key issues include underutilized space from shifting from inpatient to outpatient care, difficulties in modernizing and renovating older facilities, and the complexity of converting or disposing of historic buildings. Additionally, the passage highlights the limitations of VA's planning processes, particularly the Strategic Capital Investment Planning (SCIP) and VA Integrated Planning (VAIP) processes, which have issues with long timelines, restricted access to information, and assumptions that may not reflect current realities. The passage suggests that VA should improve stakeholder engagement and address the limitations of its planning processes to better align its facilities with veterans' needs. The VA's facility planning processes are compared to the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process used by the Department of Defense (DOD), which involved establishing clear goals, criteria, and oversight mechanisms to ensure successful implementation. The BRAC process also emphasized the importance of involving the audit community to ensure data accuracy and accountability. The passage concludes by noting that while the VA faces similar challenges, it needs to address these issues to effectively realign its properties and services. The VA should consider adopting a BRAC-like process to improve its alignment efforts, particularly in terms of stakeholder engagement, clear goal-setting, and robust oversight mechanisms. The passage emphasizes the need for the VA to engage stakeholders more effectively and to address the limitations of its planning processes to better align its facilities with the needs of veterans.

DOD has repeatedly applied the BRAC process to reduce the amount of unneeded property that it owns and leases and to save billions of dollars that could be applied to higher priority defense needs. This statement is based on GAO's April 2017 report related to VA facility alignment ( GAO-17-349 ) and numerous GAO reports related to the BRAC process as summarized in a June 2011 testimony ( GAO-11-704T ) and a March 2012 testimony ( GAO-12-513T ). This statement addresses (1) the factors that affect VA's facility alignment and the extent to which VA's capital-planning process facilitates the alignment of facilities with the veterans' population, and (2) the key elements and challenges affecting DOD and the Commission in BRAC 2005. Detailed information on our scope and methodologies for this work can be found in these published products, cited throughout this testimony. Geographic shifts in the veterans' population, changes in health care delivery, aging infrastructure, and limited stakeholder involvement affect the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) efforts to align its services and real property portfolio to meet the needs of veterans. For example, a shift over time from inpatient to outpatient care will likely result in underutilized space once used for inpatient care. Further, the historic status of some VA facilities adds to the complexity of converting or disposing of them. In such instances, it is often difficult and costly for VA to modernize, renovate, and retrofit these older facilities. GAO reported that two of the planning processes VA uses to align its facilities—VA's Strategic Capital Investment Planning (SCIP) and the VA Integrated Planning (VAIP)—have limitations that undermine VA's efforts to achieve its goals. Specifically: VA relies on the SCIP process to plan and prioritize capital projects, but VA routinely asks its facility planners to submit their next year's planned project narratives before knowing if their previous submissions have been funded. The overlapping budget cycle, which is outside of VA's control, combined with other SCIP limitations—including subjective narratives, long time frames, and restricted access to information—make it difficult for VA to rely on SCIP to accurately identify the capital necessary to address its service and infrastructure gaps. VA concurred that it needs to address SCIP limitations that are within its control, as GAO recommended; VA has made some progress in implementing the recommendation has made some progress in implementing the recommendation.\\ The VAIP process is estimated to cost $108 million and to produce market-level service delivery plans and facility master plans. However, the VAIP master plans incorrectly assume that all future growth in services will be provided directly through VA facilities without considering alternatives, such as purchasing care from the community. GAO recommended that VA consider discontinuing the VAIP facility master plans pending an assessment of their value as a facility-planning tool. VA agreed with the recommendation and is implementing it while pursuing a national realignment strategy.. Key elements of the Department of Defense's (DOD) 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process could benefit VA's asset and infrastructure review. The key elements included: (1) establishing goals for the process, (2) developing criteria for evaluating closures and realignments, and (3) establishing an organizational structure to develop closure and realignment options. GAO identified key challenges that affected DOD's implementation of BRAC 2005 and the results achieved; these challenges would need to be addressed if VA is to successfully apply the process. These challenges included: (1) large, complex recommendations required sustained senior leadership's attention and a high level of coordination among many stakeholders, and (2) the large number of actions that depend on each other for successful implementation.

This initiative has been funded using OCO appropriations, which Congress provides in addition to DOD's base budget appropriations. The Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying the Continuing Appropriations and Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017, included a provision for GAO to review matters related to ERI. In this report, we (1) describe changes in ERI's objectives, funding under ERI, and DOD's posture in Europe since 2014 and (2) evaluate the extent to which DOD's planning processes for posture initiatives funded under ERI prioritize those initiatives, estimate their long-term costs, and communicate their estimated costs to Congress. GAO analyzed DOD strategy documentation, budget and cost analysis guidance, budget justification materials, and cost and obligations data. GAO also interviewed knowledgeable officials within the Office of the Secretary of Defense, U.S. European Command, the military services, and the State Department. Since 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) has expanded the European Reassurance Initiative's (ERI) objectives, increased its funding, and planned enhancements to European posture. DOD expanded ERI's objectives from the short-term reassurance of allies and partners to include deterring Russian aggression in the long term and developing the capacity to field a credible combined force should deterrence fail. With respect to funding, DOD will have requested approximately $4.5 billion for ERI's posture enhancements through the end of fiscal year 2017 (about $3.2 billion for fiscal year 2017 alone), and in July 2016 EUCOM identified funding needs for future posture initiatives. The expansion of ERI's objectives has contributed to DOD's enhancing its posture in Europe. Specifically, DOD has increased the size and duration of Army combat unit deployments, planned to preposition Army equipment in Eastern Europe, added new enduring locations (e.g., locations that DOD expects to access and use to support U.S. security interests for the foreseeable future), improved infrastructure, and negotiated new agreements with European nations. As of April 2017, DOD was considering further force enhancements under ERI as part of the department's ERI budget request. DOD also was reviewing whether new enduring locations to support ERI were needed and was considering other improvements to existing infrastructure. DOD's process for planning ERI has not established priorities among posture initiatives funded under ERI relative to those in its base budget, nor estimated long-term sustainment costs for some posture initiatives funded under ERI, nor communicated future costs to Congress. ERI is being planned using a separate process from DOD's established processes and is funded from DOD's overseas contingency operations (OCO) appropriations. GAO found several weaknesses: Lack of prioritization : DOD establishes priorities among ERI posture initiatives but has not evaluated them against base budget initiatives using its posture management process. As a result, DOD lacks an understanding of the relative importance of ERI initiatives and may be investing in projects that it will not continue should OCO funding become unavailable. Lack of sustainment costs : EUCOM and the military services have not fully estimated the long-term costs to sustain equipment and construction funded under ERI. Based on DOD's approach for calculating rough order sustainment costs, GAO determined that these costs could be substantial. DOD officials said that GAO correctly applied DOD's approach for estimating sustainment costs, but noted that actual costs may be lower, because the military services may not fully fund sustainment. In the absence of comprehensive estimates, DOD has been limited in its ability to assess affordability and plan for future costs. Not communicating future costs : DOD limits Congress's visibility into the resources needed to implement ERI and achieve its objectives because it does not include future costs in its ERI budget request. This is a public version of a classified report issued in August 2017. Information on specific posture planning, guidance, and budget estimates that DOD deemed to be classified have been omitted from this report.

The VA medical centers lacked documentation for focused professional practice evaluations (FPPEs) for cause and retrospective reviews for 26 and 8 providers, respectively. Additionally, the VA medical centers did not initiate reviews for 16 providers for up to multiple years after concerns were raised. The VA medical centers also failed to report nine providers to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) and state licensing boards as required, despite documenting significant clinical deficiencies. The VA medical centers did not report these providers to the NPDB or state licensing boards due to a lack of awareness of their responsibilities or misinterpretation of VHA policies. The VA medical centers also failed to report providers to the NPDB and state licensing boards in a timely manner, which facilitated providers who provided substandard care at one facility from obtaining privileges at another VA medical center or at hospitals outside of VA's health care system. The GAO recommends that VHA require documentation of all reviews of providers' clinical care, establish a timeliness requirement for initiating such reviews, and strengthen oversight by requiring networks to oversee VA medical centers to ensure that such reviews are documented and initiated in a timely manner. VHA concurred with these recommendations and plans to revise existing policy and update the standardized audit tool used by the networks to include more comprehensive oversight of VA medical centers' reviews of providers' clinical care after concerns have been raised. The GAO also recommends that VHA require its networks to establish a process for overseeing VA medical centers to ensure they are reporting to the NPDB and to state licensing boards and to ensure that this reporting is timely.

The GAO's recommendations aim to address these shortcomings and", "answers": ["This testimony summarizes the information contained in GAO's November 2017 report, entitled VA Health Care: Improved Policies and Oversight Needed for Reviewing and Reporting Providers for Quality and Safety Concerns ( GAO-18-63 ). Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (VAMC) officials are responsible for reviewing the clinical care delivered by their privileged providers—physicians and dentists who are approved to independently perform specific services—after concerns are raised. The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care. For example, GAO found that after one VAMC failed to report to the NPDB or SLBs a provider who resigned to avoid an adverse privileging action, a non-VA hospital in the same city took an adverse privileging action against that same provider for the same reason 2 years later."], "length": 7070}

{"pred": " \n\nThe passage details the evolution of U.S. involvement in the Saudi-led coalition's military intervention in Yemen since March 2015. Initially, the U.S. provided logistical and intelligence support without direct military engagement. However, as the conflict escalated and humanitarian crises worsened, Congress became increasingly critical of U.S. support for the coalition. Key events included the introduction of resolutions to limit arms sales to Saudi Arabia, debates over the War Powers Resolution, and the eventual imposition of conditions on U.S. support for coalition operations. The passage highlights the tension between maintaining U.S.-Saudi relations and addressing human rights concerns and humanitarian needs in Yemen. Notably, the U.S. took steps to limit its involvement, such as suspending the transfer of precision munitions and reducing intelligence sharing, but continued to support counterterrorism efforts. The conflict's duration and the humanitarian crisis it caused led to growing congressional scrutiny and calls for a more robust response, culminating in the passage of legislation that imposed conditions on U.S. support for the coalition. The passage concludes by noting that while the U.S. may no longer be directly involved in the conflict, the humanitarian situation in Yemen remains dire, suggesting ongoing challenges for U.S. policymakers. Key evidence includes the increasing civilian casualties, the blockade of Yemen's ports, and the international condemnation of the conflict. Unique points include the evolving nature of U.S. support, the role of Congress in shaping policy, and the complex interplay between regional politics and humanitarian concerns. The passage underscores the difficulty in finding a consensus on U.S. policy toward Yemen, reflecting broader tensions in U.S. foreign policy. The 116th Congress may continue to grapple with these issues, potentially expanding oversight to address underlying causes of instability in Yemen. The passage also notes that the conflict has raised questions about the balance between supporting allies and upholding international norms and human rights.

The 116th Congress may continue to debate U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition and Saudi Arabia's conduct of the war in Yemen, where fighting has continued since March 2015. The war has exacerbated a humanitarian crisis in Yemen that began in 2011; presently, the World Food Program reports that 20 million Yemenis face hunger in the absence of sustained food assistance. The difficulty of accessing certain areas of Yemen has made it hard for governments and aid agencies to count the war's casualties. Data collected by the U.S. and European-funded Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) suggest that 60,000 Yemenis have been killed since January 2016. The Trump Administration has opposed various congressional proposals, including initiatives to reject or condition proposed U.S. arms sales or to require an end to U.S. military support to Saudi-led coalition operations in Yemen.

During FY2017, the RRB paid nearly $12.5 billion in retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to approximately 548,000 beneficiaries and paid $105.4 million in unemployment and sickness benefits to approximately 28,000 claimants. Of the total $12.5 billion benefit payments in the same fiscal year, 60.0% was paid to retired workers, 8.0% to disabled workers, 14.4% to spouses, and 16.8% to survivors. The Railroad Retirement Act (RRA) authorizes retirement, disability, and survivor benefits for railroad workers and their families. RRA is financed primarily by payroll taxes, financial interchanges from Social Security, and transfers from the National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust (NRRIT). Railroad retirement payroll taxes have two tiers: the Tier I tax is essentially the same as the Social Security payroll tax and the Tier II tax is set each year based on the railroad retirement system's asset balances, benefit payments, and administrative costs. In FY2017, the gross RRA funding was about $12.7 billion. Railroad retirement annuities are also divided into two tiers. Tier I annuities are designed to be nearly equivalent to Social Security benefits and are based on both railroad retirement and Social Security-covered employment. However, Tier I annuities are more generous than Social Security benefits in certain situations. For example, at the age of 60, railroad workers with at least 30 years of covered railroad work may receive unreduced retirement annuities. Tier II annuities are similar to private pensions and based solely on covered railroad service. Tier II annuities are paid in addition to Tier I annuities. Railroad disability annuities may be payable to totally disabled railroad workers who are permanently disabled from all work and occupational disabled workers who are found to be permanently disabled from their regular railroad occupations. Eligible spouses and survivors of railroad workers may receive a certain portion of Tier I and Tier II benefits, but divorced spouses and surviving divorced spouses are eligible for only a certain portion of Tier I benefits. The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act (RUIA) authorizes unemployment and sickness benefits for railroad workers. RUIA is financed solely by railroad employers, whose contributions are based on the taxable earnings of their employees. Eligibility for railroad unemployment and sickness benefits is based on recent railroad service and earnings. The maximum daily unemployment and sickness benefit payable in the benefit year that began July 1, 2018, is $77, and the maximum benefit for a biweekly claim is $770. Normal benefits are paid for up to 26 weeks in a benefit year.

{"pred": " \n\nPassage 2 discusses the three primary service classifications in the federal government's civil service system: the competitive service, the excepted service, and the Senior Executive Service (SES). The competitive service comprises most civil service positions in the executive branch, excluding those specifically excepted from it, positions appointed by presidential nomination, and SES positions. Employees in the competitive service undergo competitive examinations administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and are subject to specific hiring and removal standards. The excepted service includes positions that are not subject to competitive examinations and are designated by statute or OPM. These positions are categorized into four schedules based on their nature and requirements. The SES is a cadre of high-level government administrators managing major programs and projects, with distinct hiring and performance evaluation processes. Key differences among these classifications include the hiring and removal processes, pay structures, and the level of political influence in SES positions. The passage highlights the importance of these distinctions in ensuring effective governance and maintaining the integrity of the civil service system.

The summary is structured to highlight the key points and unique aspects of the passage, making", "answers": ["According to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the federal workforce consists of an estimated two million civilian employees. Federal law categorizes these employees into three types of service—the competitive service, the excepted service, and the Senior Executive Service (SES)—that may be distinguished by different selection, compensation, and other standards. Title 5 of the U.S. Code (Title 5) contains most of the standards governing federal employment, and OPM is generally responsible for implementing these requirements. The competitive service largely consists of all civil service positions in the executive branch, other than (1) positions excepted from the competitive service by statute; (2) positions appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate; and (3) the SES. Traditionally, OPM has administered examinations for entrance into the competitive service. These examinations are meant to be \"practical in character\" and relate to \"matters that fairly test the relative capacity and fitness of the applicants for the appointment sought.\" Title 5 also authorizes OPM to prescribe rules allowing agencies to hire candidates directly under specified circumstances. The excepted service includes designated civil service positions that are not in the competitive service or the SES and are not subject to competitive examination. OPM maintains authority to exempt a position from the competitive service when it determines that an appointment through competitive examination is not practicable, or the recruitment of students or recent graduates would be better achieved through alternate recruitment and assessment processes. The pay structure for the competitive service and the excepted service is similar. Both services are typically paid in accordance with the General Schedule, a schedule of annual basic pay rates that consists of 15 grades, designated \"GS-1\" through \"GS-15.\" This fixed pay scale is generally designed to reflect, among other things, equal pay for substantially equal work within a local pay area. Additionally, the competitive service and the excepted service generally have similar notice and appeal rights for adverse personnel actions. For example, before a removal, a suspension for more than 14 days, a reduction in grade or pay, or a furlough of 30 days or less, the agency must provide at least 30 days' advance written notice to the affected employee. The employee must also be given a reasonable time to respond to the notice and provide affidavits and other evidence to support the answer. Some adverse actions may also be appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB or Board), an independent, quasi-judicial agency that reviews and adjudicates specified personnel actions taken against qualifying federal employees. The SES is a corps of some 7,000 high-level government administrators who manage major programs and projects within most federal agencies. In these leadership roles, SES members may serve as a link between top-level political appointees of an agency and career civil servants within the agency. The SES is governed by a regulatory structure separate from the competitive and excepted services. While SES members are primarily career appointees chosen through a merit-based competitive hiring process, others are noncareer, limited term or limited emergency appointees (commonly political appointees) selected by agency leadership. To shield certain SES roles from political influence, some SES positions (career reserved positions) must be filled with career appointees, and Title 5 limits the number of noncareer and limited term appointees that may serve in SES positions. The SES pay structure is distinct from the rest of the civil service. Title 5 specifies that SES members are paid within a particular range based on an executive's individual performance or contribution to agency performance (or both), as measured under a performance appraisal system. In addition, Title 5 articulates special conditions and procedures for removing, suspending, or taking other adverse actions against a member of the SES. For example, career SES appointees who have successfully completed a one-year probationary period may be removed or subject to adverse action only for specified reasons, including misconduct and substandard performance. Career appointees must receive advance written notice of these actions, and an opportunity to appeal the action. In comparison, noncareer, limited term, and limited emergency appointees are generally not subject to the same protections and may be removed from the SES at any time."], "length": 7146}

This statement discusses Coast Guard actions needed to (1) improve the quality of data used for program management and (2) improve the transparency of its data for reporting on mission performance and planning. This statement is based on relevant products GAO issued from June 2014 through December 2017 on Coast Guard strategic planning and management issues, as well as related recommendation follow-up conducted through February 2018. GAO reviewed applicable laws, regulations, policies and guidance. GAO also interviewed Coast Guard officials responsible for administering these programs and obtained information on how they used data to inform decisionmaking. GAO interviewed a range of stakeholders, including federal and industry officials. GAO's prior work recommended multiple actions to improve the Coast Guard's program management by improving the quality of data it uses to manage and report on its mission performance. Specifically, GAO recommended actions such as collecting more complete data and clarifying the data limitations to facilitate more effective program management. For example, in December 2017, GAO found that more information is needed to calculate vessel safety statistics that could enhance the Coast Guard's knowledge about accident, injury, and fatality trends involving commercial fishing vessels. Having more complete information could be useful to carrying out its marine safety mission, and GAO recommended, among other things, that the Coast Guard ensure that data collected during commercial fishing vessel incident investigations is accurately captured. In 2018, the Coast Guard reported taking initial steps to capture more accurate data. GAO's prior work also identified areas where the Coast Guard could improve the transparency of the data it uses for reporting on its mission performance as well its capital planning purposes. For example, in an October 2017 report on performance goals, GAO found the Coast Guard's Annual Performance Report (APR) has not been released publicly since 2011. Consequently, there has not been full visibility over performance across all of the Coast Guard's missions. Coast Guard officials stated that a decision by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) leadership to limit the number of performance goals shared publicly had deterred the Coast Guard from public release of its APR. GAO recommended that APRs be available on the Coast Guard's website; the Coast Guard plans to publicly release future APRs. In addition, previous GAO reports found that the Coast Guard's annual 5-year capital investment plan, which projects acquisition funding needs for the upcoming 5 years, did not consistently reflect current total cost estimates or the effects of tradeoffs made as part of the annual budget cycle. GAO made recommendations to help the Coast Guard plan for future acquisitions and the difficult trade off decisions it will face given funding constraints. The Coast Guard agreed, but it is unclear when it will complete the 20-year plan.

{"pred": " \n\nThe passage discusses the approach federal agencies take towards regulating radiation exposure, particularly low-dose radiation. Agencies like the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of Energy (DOE), and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rely on scientific advisory bodies to set guidelines for radiation protection. They use the linear no-threshold model, which assumes that any radiation exposure increases cancer risk, even at low doses. The NRC sets strict limits for radiation exposure, aiming to keep the risk comparable to everyday activities. Despite uncertainties in estimating cancer risks from low-dose radiation, agencies adhere to the linear no-threshold model due to the lack of evidence suggesting benefits or safety at low doses. Federal agencies have allocated funds for research on low-dose radiation health effects, though funding has decreased over recent years. While some collaboration exists among agencies for specific projects, there is no overarching mechanism to address shared research priorities. The passage concludes by recommending that the Department of Energy (DOE) lead the development of such a collaborative mechanism to enhance interagency coordination and address shared research priorities in low-dose radiation health effects. This recommendation aims to leverage DOE's historical role and expertise in this field. The summary highlights the reliance on scientific models, the rationale behind strict exposure limits, the current state of research funding, and the need for improved interagency collaboration. Key evidence includes the use of the linear no-threshold model and the decreasing funding trends for low-dose radiation research.

The Department of Energy (DOE), Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Food and Drug Administration generally used the advice of scientific advisory bodies to develop and apply radiation protection requirements and guidance for workers and the public in the radiation exposure settings that GAO reviewed. These settings were: (1) the operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants; (2) the cleanup of sites with radiological contamination; (3) the use of medical equipment that produces radiation; and (4) accidental or terrorism-related exposure to radiation. Specifically, the agencies relied on the advice of three scientific advisory bodies that supported the use of a model that assumes the risk of cancer increases with every incremental radiation exposure. Accordingly, the agencies have set regulatory dose limits and issued guidance to confine exposure to levels that reduce the risk of cancer, while recognizing that scientific uncertainties occur in estimating cancer risks from low-dose radiation. For example, NRC requires nuclear power plants to consider measures for limiting workers' exposure below NRC's regulatory dose limit, such as by using robots for maintenance work in radiation areas. GAO identified seven federal agencies that funded research on low-dose radiation's health effects. In fiscal years 2012 to 2016, DOE, NRC, EPA, and four other federal agencies obligated about $210 million for such research . Although the agencies have collaborated on individual projects on radiation's health effects, they have not established a collaborative mechanism to set research priorities. GAO's previous work has shown that federal agencies can use such mechanisms to implement interagency collaboration to develop and coordinate sound science policies. In the past, DOE took a leading role in this area because DOE provided stable funding and advocated for greater coordination on research on low-dose radiation's health effects. However, since fiscal year 2012, DOE has phased out funding for one of its main research programs in this area. This has created a void in coordination efforts among federal agencies, and no other agency has stepped forward to fill this void. Because of DOE's prior experience as a leader in this area of research and its research responsibility under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, it could play an important role in helping federal agencies establish a coordinating mechanism for low-dose radiation research.

Since 1978, NCA has provided funding through the Veterans Cemetery Grants Program to assist state and tribal governments in establishing, expanding, or improving veterans' cemeteries. NCA's goal is to provide reasonable access to burial options for 95% of veterans, with plans to establish 18 new national cemeteries, including five traditional and 13 urban and rural initiative sites. Challenges in land acquisition, cost estimation, and data utilization have delayed the opening of some planned cemeteries. NCA's cost-estimating guidance for cemetery construction projects does not fully incorporate best practices, leading to unreliable cost estimates. Using census tract data to estimate served and unserved veteran populations could enhance NCA's decision-making. As of September 2019, only six out of 18 planned sites were open, with NCA years behind its original schedule. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs should ensure NCA updates its cost-estimating procedures to fully incorporate best practices. The progress in increasing burial access for veterans has been limited, but the opening of six sites has improved accessibility. NCA's methodology uses county-level data, which may not accurately reflect the true number of unserved veterans. The use of census tract data could provide a more precise estimate and help NCA better target areas with significant unserved veteran populations. The report recommends that NCA revise its cost-estimating guidance to include risk and uncertainty analysis, and VA should implement this recommendation.

The House Appropriations Committee has expressed concerns that there are geographic pockets where veterans remain unserved by burial options. House Report 115-188 accompanying a bill for the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018, includes a provision for GAO to examine veterans' access to burial options. This report (1) describes VA's plan for increasing reasonable access to burial options for veterans and (2) assesses VA's progress in implementing its plan and any challenges experienced. GAO reviewed applicable VA and NCA documents, compared NCA's cost-estimating practices with GAO's cost-estimating 12 steps, and met with cognizant officials regarding NCA's efforts to provide reasonable access to burial options. Within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) has a plan to establish 18 new national cemeteries to increase reasonable access to burial options for veterans. NCA defines reasonable access as a national or state veterans' cemetery being located within 75 miles of veterans' homes. Key parts of NCA's plan include establishing 13 urban and rural initiative national cemeteries and awarding grant funds to state applicants for establishing new state veterans' cemeteries. NCA has made limited progress in implementing its plan to increase burial access and is years behind its original schedule for opening new cemeteries. For example, NCA has opened only two of its planned urban and rural initiative sites and is behind its original schedule for the other 11 (see fig. below). The primary factor delaying NCA's completion of these cemeteries has been challenges in acquiring suitable land. NCA has also been challenged in producing accurate estimates of construction costs for most of its rural initiative sites. Cost estimates have increased more than 200 percent (from about $7 million to $24 million) for these sites, and NCA's guidance for developing cost estimates for the cemeteries does not fully incorporate the 12 steps identified in cost-estimating leading practices—such as conducting a risk and uncertainty analysis or a sensitivity analysis. As a result, NCA is not well positioned to provide reliable and valid cost estimates to better inform decisions to enhance veterans' cemetery access.

For such satellite systems, a single adversary attack or on-orbit failure can result in the loss of billions of dollars of investment and significant loss of vital capabilities. As DOD plans new space systems and addresses an increasingly contested space environment, it has the opportunity to consider different acquisition approaches. One such approach is to integrate a government sensor or payload onto a commercial host satellite. House Armed Services Committee report 115-200, accompanying a bill for the Fiscal Year 2018 National Defense Authorization Act, included a provision for GAO to review DOD's use of commercially hosted payloads. This report (1) determines the extent to which DOD uses commercially hosted payloads and (2) describes and assesses factors that affect their use. GAO reviewed DOD policies, documentation, and planning documents, and interviewed a wide range of DOD and civil government officials, and commercial stakeholders. GAO and others have found that using commercial satellites to host government sensors or communications packages—called payloads—may be one way DOD can achieve on-orbit capability faster and more affordably. Using hosted payloads may also help facilitate a proliferation of payloads on orbit, making it more difficult for an adversary to defeat a capability. Since 2009, DOD has used three commercially hosted payloads, with three more missions planned or underway through 2022 (see figure below). DOD estimates that it has achieved cost savings of several hundred million dollars from using commercially hosted payloads to date, and expects to realize additional savings and deliver faster capabilities on orbit from planned missions. Cost savings can result from sharing development, launch, and ground system costs with the commercial host company. Among the factors that affect DOD's use of hosted payloads are a perception among some DOD officials that matching government payloads to commercial satellites is too difficult; and limited, fragmented knowledge on how to mitigate various challenges GAO found that further opportunities to use hosted payloads may emerge as DOD plans new and follow-on space systems in the coming years. However, DOD's knowledge on using hosted payloads is fragmented, in part because programs are not required to share information. In 2011, the Air Force created a Hosted Payload Office to provide expertise and other tools to facilitate matching government payloads with commercial hosts. However, GAO found that DOD programs using hosted payloads are not required and generally do not provide cost and technical data, or lessons learned, to the Hosted Payload Office, or another central office for analysis. Requiring programs that use hosted payloads agency-wide to provide this information to a central location would better position DOD to make informed decisions when considering acquisition approaches for upcoming space system designs.

You asked GAO to review issues related to the timeliness of TPAs' payments to community providers under the Choice Program. This report examines, among other things, (1) the length of time TPAs have taken to pay community providers' claims and factors affecting timeliness of payments, and (2) actions taken by VA and the TPAs to reduce the length of time TPAs take to pay community providers for Choice Program claims. GAO reviewed TPA data on the length of time taken to pay community provider claims from November 2014 through June 2018, the most recent data available at the time of GAO's review. GAO also reviewed documentation, such as the contracts between VA and its TPAs, and interviewed VA and TPA officials. In addition, GAO interviewed a non-generalizable sample of 15 community providers, selected based on their large Choice Program claims volume, to learn about their experiences with payment timeliness. The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Veterans Choice Program (Choice Program) was created in 2014 to address problems with veterans' timely access to care at VA medical facilities. The Choice Program allows eligible veterans to obtain health care services from providers not directly employed by VA (community providers), who are then reimbursed for their services through one of the program's two third-party administrators (TPA). GAO's analysis of TPA data available for November 2014 through June 2018 shows that the length of time the TPAs took to pay community providers' clean claims each month varied widely—from 7 days to 68 days. VA and its TPAs identified several key factors affecting timeliness of payments to community providers under the Choice Program, including VA's untimely payments to TPAs, which in turn extended the length of time TPAs took to pay community providers' claims; and inadequate provider education on filing claims. VA has taken actions to address key factors that have contributed to the length of time TPAs have taken to pay community providers. For example, VA updated its payment system and related processes to pay TPAs more quickly. According to VA data, as of July 2018, VA was paying at least 90 percent of the TPAs' invoices within 7 days. In addition, VA and the TPAs have taken steps to improve provider education to help providers resolve claims processing issues. However, 9 of the 15 providers GAO interviewed said they continue to experience lengthy telephone hold times. According to VA and TPA officials, steps have been taken to improve the customer service offered to community providers. However, VA officials do not collect data on or monitor TPA compliance with customer service requirements—such as calls being answered within 30 seconds or less—for provider calls because they said they are not enforcing the requirements and are allowing TPAs to prioritize calls from veterans. Without collecting data and monitoring compliance, VA does not have information on challenges providers may face when contacting TPAs to resolve payment issues. GAO is making two recommendations, including that VA should collect data on and monitor compliance with its requirements pertaining to customer service for community providers. VA concurred with GAO's recommendations and described steps it will take to implement them."], "length": 6840}
{"pred": " \n\nPassage 1 discusses the Drug Enforcement Administration's (DEA) role in regulating the disposal of unused controlled substances. The DEA administers and enforces the Controlled Substances Act, which mandates that entities manufacturing, distributing, or dispensing controlled substances must register with the DEA. The Disposal Act of 2010 amended the Controlled Substances Act to allow the public to safely dispose of unused controlled substances through designated entities authorized by the DEA. These entities include pharmacies, hospitals, and other eligible entities. The DEA provides guidelines for setting up and maintaining disposal bins, emphasizing security and proper disposal methods to prevent diversion. Despite these provisions, only a small percentage of eligible entities have chosen to become authorized collectors, citing costs, regulatory uncertainties, and participation in alternative disposal programs as barriers. The report highlights that about half of the U.S. population lives within 5 miles of a DEA-authorized disposal bin, yet participation rates vary significantly by state, with North Dakota having the highest rate of participation. The DEA's responsibility is primarily to provide opportunities for entities to become authorized collectors, rather than to collect data on the usage or effectiveness of the disposal bins. The passage concludes by noting that while the DEA has taken steps to improve communication and guidance, challenges remain in ensuring widespread participation and effective use of the disposal bins. Key evidence includes the low participation rates, the reasons stakeholders provided for not participating, and the geographical distribution of disposal bins. Unique points include the DEA's non-retrievable standard for destruction and the potential conflicts with other federal regulations. The report also notes that the DEA does not collect detailed information on the usage or effectiveness of the disposal bins, which limits its ability to assess the program's impact comprehensively. The passage emphasizes the need for continued efforts to address these challenges and improve the program's reach and effectiveness. The main argument is that while the DEA has established a framework for safe disposal of unused controlled substances, significant barriers exist that hinder widespread participation and utilization of the program. The key evidence includes low participation rates, stakeholder concerns about costs and regulatory uncertainties, and the geographical distribution of disposal bins. The unique point is the DEA's non-retrievable standard for destruction, which poses challenges for reverse distributors. The report concludes by highlighting the need for improved communication, guidance, and possibly additional incentives to encourage greater participation and use of the disposal bins. The summary focuses on the DEA's role, the challenges faced, and the need for continued improvements in the program. The main conclusion is that while the DEA has created a system for safe", "answers": ["In 2015, 3.8 million Americans reported misusing prescription drugs within the last month, and deaths from prescription opioids have more than quadrupled since 1999. About half of the people who reported misusing prescription drugs in 2015 received them from a friend or relative. One way to help prevent this kind of diversion and potential misuse is by providing secure and convenient ways to dispose of unused, unneeded, or expired prescription medications. The Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010 authorizes pharmacies and other entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances to also collect unused prescription drugs for disposal. In 2014, DEA finalized regulations for the implementation of the Act, establishing a voluntary process for eligible entities to become authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs using disposal bins. GAO was asked to review participation among authorized collectors that maintain disposal bins. In this report GAO describes (1) participation rates among entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs and (2) factors that affect participation. GAO analyzed the most currently available DEA data from April 2017 on entities eligible to participate and those participating as authorized collectors. GAO also conducted interviews with DEA officials and a nongeneralizable sample of 11 stakeholder organizations selected to illustrate different types of authorized collectors and long-term care facilities. GAO is not making any recommendations. DEA provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. GAO found that about 3 percent of pharmacies and other entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs for disposal have volunteered to do so. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) authorizes these entities to dispose of unused drugs to help reduce their potential misuse. Analysis of DEA data shows that as of April 2017, 2,233 of the 89,550 (2.49 percent) eligible entities—that is, certain entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances—had registered with DEA to use disposal bins to collect unused prescription drugs. Most—about 81 percent—of the authorized collectors were pharmacies, followed by hospitals or clinics. GAO also found that participation rates varied by state, though in 44 states less than 5 percent of the state's pharmacies and other eligible entities had registered to become authorized collectors. Stakeholders cited several factors that may explain why relatively few pharmacies and other eligible entities have registered with DEA as authorized collectors of unused drugs. Most notably, stakeholders representing authorized collectors told GAO that because participation is voluntary, the cost associated with maintaining a disposal bin—which includes purchasing and installing the bin according to DEA requirements and paying for the destruction of its contents—is an important factor to weigh against potential benefits. DEA noted that availability of disposal by law enforcement agencies also contributes to low participation."], "length": 6757}

{"pred": " \n\nThe Federal Housing Administration (FHA) was established in 1934 to promote home ownership during the Great Depression by insuring mortgages, thereby reducing lender risk. FHA insures mortgages through the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMI Fund), which is funded by premiums and proceeds from foreclosed homes. FHA's role is countercyclical, providing mortgages when the market tightens. Key features of FHA-insured mortgages include lower down payment requirements, less stringent credit history requirements, and a focus on first-time homebuyers, low- and moderate-income households, and minorities. FHA-insured mortgages have faced criticism for potentially increasing default risk due to lower down payments and credit scores. Recent reforms have included higher minimum credit scores and down payments, and stricter underwriting standards. FHA's market share has fluctuated, peaking during the 2007-2010 housing crisis and declining since, influenced by factors like loan limits, mortgage insurance premiums, and availability of non-FHA mortgages. The fund's financial health is monitored through a capital ratio requirement, and it has historically generated negative credit subsidy, requiring no appropriations for new loans. Despite challenges, FHA continues to play a significant role in the housing market, especially for underserved borrowers. The report highlights the complex interplay between economic conditions, regulatory changes, and FHA's role in the housing finance system. The data provided show trends in the number and value of FHA-insured mortgages, as well as FHA's market share over time, illustrating the dynamic nature of FHA's impact on the housing market. The unique aspect of this passage is the detailed examination of FHA's historical context, current operations, and evolving role in the housing finance system. The report also underscores the importance of maintaining the MMI Fund's financial stability through careful management of premiums and underwriting standards. The summary effectively captures the essence of the passage, highlighting key points about FHA's establishment, operations, market role, and financial management, while also noting the challenges and debates surrounding its appropriate market share. The inclusion of data on market share and fund health provides a comprehensive view of FHA's current and historical significance in the housing market. The summary concludes by emphasizing the ongoing relevance of FHA in providing access to homeownership for certain segments of the population, despite the complexities involved. This encapsulates the main arguments, key evidence, and unique insights presented in the passage. ```plaintext\nThe Federal Housing Administration (FHA) was established in 1934 to promote home ownership during the Great Depression by insuring mortgages", "answers": ["The Federal Housing Administration (FHA), an agency of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), was created by the National Housing Act of 1934. FHA insures private lenders against the possibility of borrowers defaulting on mortgages that meet certain criteria, thereby expanding the availability of mortgage credit beyond what may be available otherwise. If the borrower defaults on the mortgage, FHA is to repay the lender the remaining amount owed. A household that obtains an FHA-insured mortgage must meet FHA's eligibility and underwriting standards, including showing that it has sufficient income to repay a mortgage. FHA requires a minimum down payment of 3.5% from most borrowers, which is lower than the down payment required for many other types of mortgages. FHA-insured mortgages cannot exceed a statutory maximum mortgage amount, which varies by area and is based on area median house prices but cannot exceed a specified ceiling in high-cost areas. (The ceiling is set at $726,525 in high-cost areas in calendar year 2019.) Borrowers are charged fees, called mortgage insurance premiums, in exchange for the insurance. In FY2018, FHA insured over 1 million new mortgages (including both home purchase and refinance mortgages) with a combined principal balance of $209 billion. FHA's share of the mortgage market tends to vary with economic conditions and other factors. In the aftermath of the housing market turmoil that began around 2007 and a related contraction of mortgage lending, FHA insured a larger share of mortgages than it had in the preceding years. Its overall share of the mortgage market increased from about 3% in calendar year 2005 to a peak of 21% in 2009. Since that time, FHA's share of the mortgage market has decreased somewhat, though it remains higher than it was in the early 2000s. In calendar year 2017, FHA's overall share of the mortgage market was about 17%. FHA-insured mortgages, like all mortgages, experienced increased default rates during the housing downturn that began around 2007, leading to concerns about the stability of the FHA insurance fund for single-family mortgages, the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMI Fund). In response to these concerns, FHA adopted a number of policy changes in an attempt to limit risk to the MMI Fund. These changes have included raising the fees that it charges and making changes to certain eligibility criteria for FHA-insured loans."], "length": 6728}

One type of transaction, called a swap exchange, enables GSA to apply the value of federal property to finance construction without relying on appropriated funds. Under such an exchange, GSA transfers the title of the unneeded property to a private investor after receiving the agreed upon construction services at another location. GSA proposed a swap exchange procurement for construction of a new FBI headquarters building in exchange for the Hoover Building and appropriations to compensate for the difference in value between the Hoover Building and the new building. GSA cancelled this procurement in July 2017 due to lack of funding. This statement addresses (1) GSA's and FBI's assessments of the Hoover Building, (2) GSA efforts to implement swap exchanges, and (3) alternative approaches to funding real property projects. It is based on GAO's body of reports on real property from 2011 to 2017, and selected updates from GSA. In November 2011, GAO reported that, according to General Services Administration (GSA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) assessments, the FBI's headquarters building (Hoover Building) and its accompanying facilities in Washington, D.C., did not fully support the FBI's long-term security, space, and building condition requirements. Since GAO's report, the assessments have not materially changed, for example: Security: GAO's prior work noted that the dispersion of staff in annexes creates security challenges, including where some space was leased by the FBI and other space was leased by nonfederal tenants. Earlier this year, GAO reported the FBI is leasing space in D.C. from foreign owners. Space : In 2011, GAO reported that FBI and GSA studies showed that much of the Hoover Building is unusable. GSA noted in its fiscal year 2017 project prospectus for the FBI headquarters consolidation that the Hoover Building cannot be redeveloped to meet the FBI's current needs. Building Condition: In GAO's 2011 report, GAO noted that the condition of the Hoover Building was deteriorating, and GSA assessments identified significant recapitalization needs. Since GAO's report and in response to GAO's recommendation, GSA has evaluated its approach to maintaining the building and completed some repairs to ensure safety. GSA has limited experience in successfully completing swap exchange transactions and chose not to pursue several proposed swap exchanges, most recently the planned swap exchange for the Hoover Building. GSA has developed criteria for determining when to solicit market interest in a swap exchange, in response to recommendations in GAO's 2014 report. In addition, GSA officials told GAO that they planned to improve the swap exchange process, including the property appraisal process, outreach to stakeholders to identify potential risks associated with future projects, and to the extent possible, mitigate such risks. Nevertheless, several factors may continue to limit use of swap exchanges, including market factors, such as the availability of alternative properties and an investor's approach for valuing properties. For example, in reviewing a proposed swap exchange in Washington, D.C., GAO found in a 2016 report that the proposals from two firms valued the two federal buildings involved in the proposed swap substantially less than GSA's appraised property value. In a 2014 report, GAO identified a number of alternative approaches to funding real property projects. Congress has provided some agencies with specific authorities to use alternative funding mechanisms—including the use of private sector funds or land swaps—for the acquisition, renovation, or disposal of federal real property without full, upfront funding, though GAO has previously reported that upfront funding is the best way to ensure recognition of commitments made in budgeting decisions and maintain fiscal controls. GAO has reported that projects with alternative funding mechanisms present multiple forms of risk that are shared between the agency and any partner or stakeholder. In addition, alternative budgetary structures could be established, such as changing existing or introducing new account structures to fund real property projects. GAO has made recommendations in the past to GSA on various real property issues, including to develop additional guidance for swap exchanges and to evaluate its approach to maintaining the Hoover Building. GSA agreed with these two recommendations and addressed them."], "length": 7384}

Anticipating future needs, DOD began investing in new radar systems that share capabilities with Cobra Dane to support ballistic missile defense and space surveillance, including the LRDR (Alaska), the Space Fence (Marshall Islands), and the Pacific Radar (location to be determined). The conference report accompanying a bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 included a provision that GAO review the Air Force's report to Congress on the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane. This report identifies information included in the Air Force's report and describes additional information that GAO reviewed on (1) the capabilities of the Cobra Dane radar and other planned radars to meet DOD's mission requirements, (2) Cobra Dane's operational availability and the plan to mitigate the effect on those missions when Cobra Dane is not available, and (3) DOD's funding plan and project cost estimates for the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane and its site at Shemya Island. GAO reviewed the Air Force report and related documentation, and interviewed relevant officials. In its January 2018 report to Congress, the Air Force reported how the Cobra Dane radar and the Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR) have shared and unique capabilities to support ballistic missile defense and space surveillance missions. The report noted that the respective locations of both radar systems affect their ability to provide those capabilities. The Department of Defense (DOD) also has other radar investments—the Pacific Radar and the Space Fence, which, according to DOD officials, may reduce DOD's reliance on Cobra Dane to provide ballistic missile defense and space surveillance capabilities. The Air Force's report to Congress noted that Cobra Dane met its requirement for operational availability, which refers to the percentage of time that the radar is able to meet its missions. GAO found that the Air Force has developed procedures to mitigate risks when Cobra Dane is not available. For example, U.S. Northern Command and Missile Defense Agency (MDA) officials stated that they can mitigate risks when Cobra Dane is not available by using the Sea-Based X-band radar to provide support for ballistic missile defense. The Air Force would face some limitations in its ability to conduct space surveillance if Cobra Dane were not available, as Cobra Dane tracks objects no other radar can track. However, MDA officials noted there are no plans to take Cobra Dane offline long enough to compromise space surveillance. The Air Force and MDA plan to contribute total funding of $278.6 million for the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane, according to their fiscal year 2019 budget plans. Specifically, the Air Force and MDA plan to share funding for the operation and maintenance of the Cobra Dane radar and for three modernization projects that make up their sustainment plan for the radar. Further, the Air Force report noted that the Air Force also plans to provide $140 million in funding for the sustainment and maintenance of operational access to Cobra Dane's site at Shemya Island. In addition, GAO found that the Air Force developed a total cost estimate for one project—known as the transmitter group replacement—but not for its other two projects.

{"pred": " \n\nThe GAO report examines the documentation and timeliness of reviews of providers' clinical care at five VA medical centers from October 2013 to March 2017. Key findings include that almost half of the required reviews were undocumented, and many reviews were initiated late. The report attributes these issues to a lack of VHA policy requiring documentation of all reviews and oversight of these processes. Additionally, the VA medical centers failed to report nine providers to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) and state licensing boards as required, due to misinterpretations of VHA policies and inadequate oversight. The report recommends that VHA require documentation of all reviews, establish timeliness requirements, and strengthen oversight to ensure providers are reported to the NPDB and state licensing boards when warranted. The VA concurred with these recommendations and plans to implement changes. The report highlights the importance of proper documentation and timely reviews for ensuring patient safety and preventing substandard care providers from obtaining privileges at other facilities. The findings underscore the need for improved oversight and adherence to VHA policies to protect veterans receiving care. The report also notes that the VA medical centers did not always follow the required steps for reporting providers to the NPDB and state licensing boards, even when providers had significant clinical deficiencies, which could lead to the same providers obtaining privileges at other facilities. The report concludes that VHA's failure to report providers to the NPDB and state licensing boards as required facilitates providers who provide substandard care at one facility obtaining privileges at another VA medical center or at hospitals outside of VA's health care system. The report emphasizes the critical role of proper documentation and timely reviews in maintaining patient safety and ensuring accountability for healthcare providers. The findings suggest that the current oversight mechanisms are insufficient and need to be strengthened to prevent the continuation of substandard care practices.

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (VAMC) officials are responsible for reviewing the clinical care delivered by their privileged providers—physicians and dentists who are approved to independently perform specific services—after concerns are raised. The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care. For example, GAO found that after one VAMC failed to report to the NPDB or SLBs a provider who resigned to avoid an adverse privileging action, a non-VA hospital in the same city took an adverse privileging action against that same provider for the same reason 2 years later."], "length": 7081}

{"pred": " \n\nPassage 2 discusses the approach federal agencies take towards regulating radiation exposure, particularly low-dose radiation. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's 2006 report on radiation and human health suggests that the risk of cancer increases with every incremental increase in radiation exposure, a concept known as the linear no-threshold model. Federal agencies like the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of Energy (DOE), and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rely on this model to set dose limits for radiation exposure. For instance, the NRC sets an annual dose limit for the public that is significantly lower than what is considered low dose by the National Academies. The passage also notes that while the health effects of low-dose radiation are challenging to estimate accurately, federal agencies continue to use the linear no-threshold model due to the lack of convincing evidence suggesting otherwise. Additionally, the passage highlights that federal agencies have been reducing their funding for research on the health effects of low-dose radiation, with a significant decrease observed from fiscal year 2012 to 2016. Despite this, the agencies have collaborated on specific research projects but have not established a collaborative mechanism to address overall research priorities. The passage concludes by noting that the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommended that the Department of Energy (DOE) lead the development of a mechanism for interagency collaboration to address these research priorities, although DOE did not agree with this recommendation. The GAO believes that DOE is well-positioned to lead such an effort due to its historical role in advocating for better communication and coordination between radiation biology and epidemiology fields. The GAO also emphasized that this recommendation does not replace the agencies' existing legal mandates and budget authorities. The summary ends with details about the contributors to the report and the fact that the work is in the public domain. The key points include the reliance on the linear no-threshold model, the reduction in research funding, and the need for interagency collaboration to address research priorities. The passage also highlights the challenges in accurately estimating the health effects of low-dose radiation and the ongoing debate around funding and research priorities. The unique aspect is the suggestion that DOE should lead the development of a collaborative mechanism despite its disagreement with the GAO's recommendation.

The Department of Energy (DOE), Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Food and Drug Administration generally used the advice of scientific advisory bodies to develop and apply radiation protection requirements and guidance for workers and the public in the radiation exposure settings that GAO reviewed. These settings were: (1) the operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants; (2) the cleanup of sites with radiological contamination; (3) the use of medical equipment that produces radiation; and (4) accidental or terrorism-related exposure to radiation. Specifically, the agencies relied on the advice of three scientific advisory bodies that supported the use of a model that assumes the risk of cancer increases with every incremental radiation exposure. Accordingly, the agencies have set regulatory dose limits and issued guidance to confine exposure to levels that reduce the risk of cancer, while recognizing that scientific uncertainties occur in estimating cancer risks from low-dose radiation. For example, NRC requires nuclear power plants to consider measures for limiting workers' exposure below NRC's regulatory dose limit, such as by using robots for maintenance work in radiation areas. GAO identified seven federal agencies that funded research on low-dose radiation's health effects. In fiscal years 2012 to 2016, DOE, NRC, EPA, and four other federal agencies obligated about $210 million for such research . Although the agencies have collaborated on individual projects on radiation's health effects, they have not established a collaborative mechanism to set research priorities. GAO's previous work has shown that federal agencies can use such mechanisms to implement interagency collaboration to develop and coordinate sound science policies. In the past, DOE took a leading role in this area because DOE provided stable funding and advocated for greater coordination on research on low-dose radiation's health effects. However, since fiscal year 2012, DOE has phased out funding for one of its main research programs in this area. This has created a void in coordination efforts among federal agencies, and no other agency has stepped forward to fill this void. Because of DOE's prior experience as a leader in this area of research and its research responsibility under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, it could play an important role in helping federal agencies establish a coordinating mechanism for low-dose radiation research.

{"pred": " \n\nThe passage details the evolution of U.S. involvement in the Saudi-led coalition's military intervention in Yemen since March 2015. Initially, the U.S. provided logistical and intelligence support without direct military engagement. However, as the conflict escalated and humanitarian crises worsened, Congress became increasingly critical of U.S. support for the coalition. Key events included the introduction of resolutions to limit arms sales to Saudi Arabia, debates over the War Powers Resolution, and the eventual imposition of conditions on U.S. support for coalition operations. The passage highlights the tension between maintaining U.S.-Saudi relations and addressing human rights concerns and humanitarian needs in Yemen. Notably, the U.S. took steps to limit its involvement, such as suspending the transfer of precision munitions and reducing intelligence sharing, but continued to support counterterrorism efforts. The conflict's duration and the humanitarian crisis it caused led to growing congressional scrutiny and calls for a more robust response, culminating in the passage of legislation that imposed conditions on U.S. support for the coalition. The passage concludes by noting that while the U.S. may no longer be directly involved in the conflict, the humanitarian situation in Yemen remains dire, suggesting ongoing challenges for U.S. policymakers. Key evidence includes the increasing civilian casualties, the blockade of Yemen's ports, and the international condemnation of the conflict. Unique points include the evolving nature of U.S. support, the role of Congress in shaping policy, and the complex interplay between regional politics and humanitarian concerns. The passage underscores the difficulty in finding a consensus on U.S. policy toward Yemen, reflecting broader tensions in U.S. foreign policy. The 116th Congress may continue to grapple with these issues, potentially expanding oversight to address underlying causes of instability in Yemen. The passage also notes that the conflict has raised questions about the balance between supporting allies and upholding international norms and human rights. The evolving nature of U.S. support and the increasing scrutiny from Congress highlight the complexity of U.S. foreign policy in the region. The passage concludes by emphasizing the enduring humanitarian crisis in Yemen and the need for sustained international attention and assistance.

The 116th Congress may continue to debate U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition and Saudi Arabia's conduct of the war in Yemen, where fighting has continued since March 2015. The war has exacerbated a humanitarian crisis in Yemen that began in 2011; presently, the World Food Program reports that 20 million Yemenis face hunger in the absence of sustained food assistance. The difficulty of accessing certain areas of Yemen has made it hard for governments and aid agencies to count the war's casualties. Data collected by the U.S. and European-funded Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) suggest that 60,000 Yemenis have been killed since January 2016. The Trump Administration has opposed various congressional proposals, including initiatives to reject or condition proposed U.S. arms sales or to require an end to U.S. military support to Saudi-led coalition operations in Yemen.

{"pred": " \n\nThe federal government owns approximately 640 million acres, primarily in the western states, managed by four agencies: National Park Service (NPS), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and U.S. Forest Service (USFS). These agencies have varying authorities to acquire and dispose of federal lands. The NPS lacks general authority to acquire new lands, while the BLM has broad authority to acquire and dispose of lands. The FWS can acquire lands but cannot dispose of them without Congressional approval, except through exchanges or if lands are no longer needed. The USFS has limited acquisition and disposal authorities, mainly for lands within or contiguous to national forests. Congress often debates the adequacy and use of these authorities, and various bills propose modifications or eliminations. Funding for land acquisition comes primarily from the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), with additional sources like the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund (MBCF) for specific agencies. The BLM has broad land disposal authorities, including exchanges, sales, and transfers, while the NPS, FWS, and USFS have more limited disposal authorities. Key evidence includes the varying acquisition and disposal authorities granted by Congress and the specific laws governing each agency's actions. Unique points include the importance of the MBCF for FWS land acquisitions and the broad land disposal authorities of the BLM. Congress frequently considers legislation to address the extent of federal land ownership and funding mechanisms for land acquisition. The BLM's Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act provides a significant revenue stream for land acquisition and development in Nevada. The General Mining Law of 1872, though still in effect, has been largely suspended due to annual moratoria since FY1995. The FWS's Migratory Bird Conservation Act and the USFS's various acquisition authorities are notable for their predictability and permanence in funding. The NPS's inability to dispose of lands without Congressional approval highlights the strict preservation focus of the agency. The BLM's ability to use eminent domain for land acquisition and its broad land disposal authorities underscore the agency's role in balancing resource management and public access. The varying authorities and funding mechanisms reflect the complex interplay between federal land management and public policy. The passage outlines the diverse authorities and funding mechanisms for federal land management agencies, emphasizing the unique roles and constraints of each agency in acquiring and disposing of federal lands. The BLM stands out with its broadest authorities, while the NPS has the narrowest. Congress plays a", "answers": ["The federal government owns roughly 640 million acres, heavily concentrated in 12 western states. Four agencies—the National Park Service (NPS), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in the Department of the Interior, and the U.S. Forest Service (FS) in the Department of Agriculture—administer about 95% of those lands. The extent to which each of these four federal agencies have authority to acquire and dispose of land varies considerably. The BLM has relatively broad authority for both acquisitions and disposals under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA). The agency also has other authorities for disposing of land, including two laws that allow the agency to retain the proceeds for subsequent land acquisition, among other purposes, and a law that allows transfers to governmental units and other entities for public purposes. By contrast, the NPS has no general authority to acquire land to create new park units or to dispose of park lands. The FS authority to acquire lands is mostly limited to lands within or contiguous to the boundaries of a national forest. The agency has various authorities to dispose of land, but they are relatively constrained and infrequently used. The FWS has various authorities to acquire lands but no general authority to dispose of its lands. The agency frequently uses acquisition authority under the Migratory Bird Conservation Act of 1929 because of the availability of funding through the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund. The nature of the acquisition and disposal authorities of the four federal agencies also varies. In general, the acquisition authorities are designed to allow the four agencies to bring into federal ownership lands that many contend could benefit from federal management. Disposal authorities generally are designed to allow agencies to convey land that is no longer needed for a federal purpose or that might be chiefly valuable for another purpose. Some of the authorities specify particular circumstances where they can be used, such as the conveyance of FS land for educational purposes and the disposal of BLM land for recreation and public purposes. Congress often faces questions on the adequacy of existing acquisition and disposal authorities; the nature, extent, and location of their use; and the extent of federal land ownership overall. The current acquisition and disposal authorities form the backdrop for consideration of measures to establish, modify, or eliminate authorities, or to provide for the acquisition or disposal of particular lands. In some cases, Congress enacts bills to provide authority to acquire or dispose of particular parcels where no standing authority exists and, in other cases, to direct or facilitate land transactions. Congress also addresses acquisition and disposal policy in the context of debates on the role and goals of the federal government in owning and managing land generally, and it has considered broader measures to dispose of lands or to promote acquisition. Other issues for Congress pertain to the sources and levels of funds for land acquisition. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) is the primary source of funding for land acquisition. Congress has considered diverse measures related to the LWCF, such as legislation to make LWCF funding permanent and bills to direct LWCF monies to additional, nonacquisition purposes. Additionally, the FWS has the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund, an account with mandatory spending authority supported by revenue from three sources. The BLM also has mandatory spending authorities that allow the proceeds from land sales to be used for land acquisition, among other purposes."], "length": 6617}

{"pred": " \n\nPassage 2 discusses the approach taken by federal agencies in the United States to regulate radiation exposure, particularly focusing on low-dose radiation. The main argument is that these agencies rely on scientific advisory bodies, such as the International Commission on Radiological Protection, the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements, and the National Academies' Nuclear and Radiation Studies Board, to guide their policies. The linear no-threshold model, which assumes that any increase in radiation exposure increases cancer risk, is widely used. Federal agencies set dose limits for radiation exposure that are significantly lower than the levels considered safe by the National Academies. For instance, the NRC's annual dose limit for the public is a hundredth of the level defined as low dose by the National Academies. The passage also notes that while there is uncertainty about the effects of low-dose radiation, especially below 100 millisieverts, federal agencies continue to use the linear no-threshold model due to the lack of evidence suggesting otherwise. Additionally, the passage highlights that federal agencies have been decreasing their funding for research on the health effects of low-dose radiation, with a 48% reduction in funding over the period from 2012 to 2016. Despite this, the agencies collaborate on specific research projects but do not have a formal mechanism to address overall research priorities. The GAO recommends that the Department of Energy (DOE) lead the development of such a mechanism to ensure better coordination and determination of roles and responsibilities for addressing shared research priorities. The recommendation is based on DOE's past experience and current legal mandate for radiation protection research. However, DOE did not agree with this recommendation, citing its legal mandates and budget authorities as reasons for not leading such an effort. The passage concludes by noting that while the agencies continue to use the linear no-threshold model, the lack of comprehensive research on low-dose radiation remains a concern. The unique point is the suggestion that a collaborative mechanism could help reduce uncertainty in predicting cancer risk from low-dose radiation exposure. The summary focuses on the key points regarding regulation, funding trends, and the need for better interagency collaboration. The evidence includes the use of the linear no-threshold model, dose limits set by federal agencies, and the decrease in research funding. The innovative aspect is the recommendation for a collaborative mechanism to address research priorities. The summary omits less relevant details and focuses on the main arguments and conclusions. The key evidence and supporting data are presented concisely to support the main points. The summary", "answers": ["This testimony summarizes the information contained in GAO's September 2017 report, entitled Low-Dose Radiation: Interagency Collaboration on Planning Research Could Improve Information on Health Effects ( GAO-17-546 ). The Department of Energy (DOE), Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Food and Drug Administration generally used the advice of scientific advisory bodies to develop and apply radiation protection requirements and guidance for workers and the public in the radiation exposure settings that GAO reviewed. These settings were: (1) the operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants; (2) the cleanup of sites with radiological contamination; (3) the use of medical equipment that produces radiation; and (4) accidental or terrorism-related exposure to radiation. Specifically, the agencies relied on the advice of three scientific advisory bodies that supported the use of a model that assumes the risk of cancer increases with every incremental radiation exposure. Accordingly, the agencies have set regulatory dose limits and issued guidance to confine exposure to levels that reduce the risk of cancer, while recognizing that scientific uncertainties occur in estimating cancer risks from low-dose radiation. For example, NRC requires nuclear power plants to consider measures for limiting workers' exposure below NRC's regulatory dose limit, such as by using robots for maintenance work in radiation areas. GAO identified seven federal agencies that funded research on low-dose radiation's health effects. In fiscal years 2012 to 2016, DOE, NRC, EPA, and four other federal agencies obligated about $210 million for such research . Although the agencies have collaborated on individual projects on radiation's health effects, they have not established a collaborative mechanism to set research priorities. GAO's previous work has shown that federal agencies can use such mechanisms to implement interagency collaboration to develop and coordinate sound science policies. In the past, DOE took a leading role in this area because DOE provided stable funding and advocated for greater coordination on research on low-dose radiation's health effects. However, since fiscal year 2012, DOE has phased out funding for one of its main research programs in this area. This has created a void in coordination efforts among federal agencies, and no other agency has stepped forward to fill this void. Because of DOE's prior experience as a leader in this area of research and its research responsibility under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, it could play an important role in helping federal agencies establish a coordinating mechanism for low-dose radiation research.

These capabilities make attack submarines some of the most–requested assets by the global combatant commanders. GAO was asked to review the readiness of the Navy's attack submarine force. This report discusses the extent to which the Navy (1) has experienced maintenance delays in its attack submarine fleet and costs associated with any delays; and (2) has addressed any challenges and developed mitigation plans for any maintenance delays. GAO analyzed readiness information from fiscal years 2008-2018, operating and support costs, maintenance performance, and other data; visited attack submarines and squadrons; and interviewed public and private shipyard and fleet officials. This is a public version of a classified report issued in October 2018. Information the Department of Defense deemed classified or sensitive, such as attack submarine force structure requirements and detailed data on attack submarine maintenance delays, has been omitted. The Navy has been unable to begin or complete the vast majority of its attack submarine maintenance periods on time resulting in significant maintenance delays and operating and support cost expenditures. GAO's analysis of Navy maintenance data shows that between fiscal year 2008 and 2018, attack submarines have incurred 10,363 days of idle time and maintenance delays as a result of delays in getting into and out of the shipyards. For example, the Navy originally scheduled the USS Boise to enter a shipyard for an extended maintenance period in 2013 but, due to heavy shipyard workload, the Navy delayed the start of the maintenance period. In June 2016, the USS Boise could no longer conduct normal operations and the boat has remained idle, pierside for over two years since then waiting to enter a shipyard (see figure). GAO estimated that since fiscal year 2008 the Navy has spent more than $1.5 billion in fiscal year 2018 constant dollars to support attack submarines that provide no operational capability—those sitting idle while waiting to enter the shipyards, and those delayed in completing their maintenance at the shipyards. The Navy has started to address challenges related to workforce shortages and facilities needs at the public shipyards. However, it has not effectively allocated maintenance periods among public shipyards and private shipyards that may also be available to help minimize attack submarine idle time. GAO's analysis found that while the public shipyards have operated above capacity for the past several years, attack submarine maintenance delays are getting longer and idle time is increasing. The Navy may have options to mitigate this idle time and maintenance delays by leveraging private shipyard capacity for repair work. But the Navy has not completed a comprehensive business case analysis as recommended by Department of Defense guidelines to inform maintenance workload allocation across public and private shipyards. Navy leadership has acknowledged that they need to be more proactive in leveraging potential private shipyard repair capacity. Without addressing this challenge, the Navy risks continued expenditure of operating and support funding to crew, maintain, and support attack submarines that provide no operational capability because they are delayed in getting into and out of maintenance. GAO recommends that the Navy conduct a business case analysis to inform maintenance workload allocation across public and private shipyards. The Department of Defense concurred with GAO's recommendation."], "length": 5163}

Specifically, the VA medical centers lacked documentation for 26 providers regarding focused professional practice evaluations (FPPEs) for cause and for 8 providers regarding retrospective reviews. Additionally, 16 providers were not reviewed for 3 months to multiple years after concerns were raised. The VA medical centers also failed to report nine providers to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) and state licensing boards as required by VHA policy, despite having significant clinical deficiencies. This failure to report providers to the NPDB and state licensing boards allowed some providers to continue practicing at other VA medical centers or outside of VA's health care system, potentially harming veterans. The VA medical centers' lack of familiarity with or misinterpretation of VHA policies, as well as inadequate oversight by VHA networks, contributed to these issues. The report recommends that VHA require documentation of all reviews, establish timeliness requirements, and strengthen oversight to ensure that providers are reported to the NPDB and state licensing boards when warranted. The VA concurred with these recommendations and plans to implement changes. The report highlights the importance of proper documentation and timely reviews to ensure patient safety and prevent substandard care providers from practicing elsewhere. The findings suggest systemic issues within the VA medical centers and highlight the need for improved oversight and policy implementation to address these problems. The report also notes that the VA medical centers' failure to report providers to the NPDB and state licensing boards facilitated the continued practice of substandard care providers at other facilities, potentially endangering veteran patients.

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (VAMC) officials are responsible for reviewing the clinical care delivered by their privileged providers—physicians and dentists who are approved to independently perform specific services—after concerns are raised. The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care. For example, GAO found that after one VAMC failed to report to the NPDB or SLBs a provider who resigned to avoid an adverse privileging action, a non-VA hospital in the same city took an adverse privileging action against that same provider for the same reason 2 years later."], "length": 7059}
{"pred": " \n\nThe Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) Act of 1965 aims to promote outdoor recreation and enhance the health and vitality of U.S. citizens by providing funds for federal land acquisition and state assistance. The fund, authorized to receive $900 million annually, primarily generates revenue from oil and gas leases on the Outer Continental Shelf, motorboat fuel taxes, and surplus property sales. However, actual appropriations from the fund vary widely due to the discretionary nature of the process. Since its inception, less than half of the accrued funds have been appropriated, leaving a significant unappropriated balance. The fund traditionally supports federal land acquisition and state outdoor recreation grants, but in recent years, it has also been used for other purposes such as facility maintenance, ecosystem restoration, and various natural resource-related programs. Notably, the Forest Legacy Program and Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund have received the majority of the other-purpose funding. Despite concerns from traditional beneficiaries about potential dilution of funding for land acquisition and state grants, the LWCF continues to be a source of funding for diverse natural resource initiatives. Key data show that from FY1998 to FY2019, $2.7 billion was appropriated for other purposes, representing 27% of the total LWCF appropriations during that period. The Forest Legacy Program and Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund have received the largest shares of these other-purpose funds. The LWCF's flexibility in funding other purposes reflects ongoing debates about the fund's primary mission and how best to allocate its resources. The passage highlights the complex interplay between legislative discretion, executive requests, and stakeholder interests in determining the fund's allocation. The variability in appropriations underscores the need for clearer guidelines on the fund's intended uses. The report concludes by noting that while the LWCF remains a valuable tool for natural resource conservation, its evolving role necessitates continued scrutiny and dialogue among policymakers, stakeholders, and the public. The summary captures the main arguments, key evidence, and unique points regarding the LWCF's funding and usage patterns.

The fund also receives mandatory appropriations under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (GOMESA). The level of annual appropriations for the LWCF has varied since the origin of the fund in FY1965. The LWCF Act outlines uses of the fund for federal and state purposes. Of the total made available through appropriations or deposits under GOMESA, not less than 40% is to be used for \"federal purposes\" and not less than 40% is to be used to provide \"financial assistance to states.\" The act lists the federal purposes for which the President is to allot LWCF funds \"unless otherwise allotted in the appropriation Act making them available.\" These purposes primarily relate to acquisition of lands and waters (and interests therein) by the federal government. With regard to state purposes, the act authorizes a matching grant program to states for outdoor recreation purposes. Throughout the LWCF's history, appropriations acts typically have provided funds for land acquisition and outdoor recreational grants to states. Beginning in FY1998, appropriations also have been provided each year (except FY1999) to fund other purposes related to natural resources. The extent to which the LWCF should be used for purposes other than federal land acquisition and outdoor recreation grants to states, and which other purposes should be funded from the LWCF, continue to be the subject of legislation and debate in Congress. In the past few decades, Presidents have sought LWCF funds for a variety of other purposes. Congress chooses which if any of these requests to fund, and has chosen programs not sought by the President for a particular year. Among other programs, appropriations have been provided for facility maintenance of the land management agencies, ecosystem restoration, the Historic Preservation Fund, the Payments in Lieu of Taxes program, the Forest Legacy Program, State and Tribal Wildlife Grants (under the Fish and Wildlife Service), the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund, U.S. Geological Survey science and cooperative programs, and Bureau of Indian Affairs Indian Land and Water Claim Settlements. Since FY1998, a total of $2.7 billion has been appropriated for other purposes, of a total LWCF appropriation of $18.9 billion over the history of the fund. The Fish and Wildlife Service and the Forest Service have received the largest shares of the total appropriations for other purposes, about $1.4 billion (53%) and $1.0.billion (38%), respectively, from FY1998 to FY2019. Several agencies shared the remaining $0.2 billion (9%) of the appropriations. Both the dollar amounts and the percentages of annual LWCF appropriations for other purposes have varied widely since FY1998. The dollar amounts have ranged from $0 in FY1999 to $456.0 million in FY2001. The percentage of annual funds provided for other purposes ranged from 0% in FY1999 to a high of 59% in both FY2006 and FY2007. In some years, the appropriation for other purposes was significantly less than the Administration requested. For instance, for FY2008, the George W.

The findings revealed significant inadequacies in documentation and timely reviews, with nearly half of the required reviews lacking proper documentation. Specifically, focused professional practice evaluations (FPPEs) for cause were missing for 26 providers, and retrospective reviews were absent for 8 providers. Moreover, 16 providers were not reviewed for up to three months after concerns were raised. The GAO attributed these issues to insufficient VHA policy requirements and inadequate oversight by the VA. Recommendations were made to mandate documentation of all reviews, establish timeliness requirements, and enhance network oversight. The VA agreed to implement these changes. Additionally, the GAO found that only one of nine providers who faced adverse privileging actions or resigned during the study period was reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) and state licensing boards, despite having significant clinical deficiencies. Misinterpretations of VHA policies and lack of network oversight contributed to this failure. The GAO recommended that VHA require networks to establish processes for timely reporting to the NPDB and state licensing boards.

{"pred": " \n\nThe Federal Housing Administration (FHA) was established in 1934 to promote home ownership during the Great Depression by insuring mortgages, thereby reducing lender risk. FHA insures mortgages through the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMI Fund), which is funded by premiums and proceeds from foreclosed homes. FHA's role is countercyclical, providing mortgages when the market tightens. Key features of FHA-insured mortgages include lower down payment requirements, less stringent credit history requirements, and a focus on first-time homebuyers, low- and moderate-income households, and minorities. FHA-insured mortgages have faced criticism for potentially increasing default risk due to lower down payments and credit scores. Recent reforms have included higher minimum credit scores and down payments, and stricter underwriting standards. FHA's market share has fluctuated, peaking during the 2007-2010 housing crisis and declining since, influenced by factors like loan limits, mortgage insurance premiums, and availability of non-FHA mortgages. The fund's financial health is monitored through a capital ratio requirement, and it has historically generated negative credit subsidy, requiring no appropriations for new loans. Despite challenges, FHA continues to play a significant role in the housing market, especially for underserved borrowers. The report highlights the complex interplay between economic conditions, regulatory changes, and FHA's role in the housing finance system. The data provided show trends in the number and value of FHA-insured mortgages, as well as FHA's market share over time, illustrating the dynamic nature of FHA's impact on the housing market. The unique aspect of this passage is the detailed examination of FHA's historical context, current operations, and evolving role in the housing finance system. The report also underscores the importance of maintaining the MMI Fund's financial stability through careful management of premiums and underwriting standards. The summary effectively captures the essence of the passage, highlighting key points about FHA's establishment, operations, market role, and financial management, while also noting the challenges and debates surrounding its appropriate market share. The inclusion of data on market share and fund health provides a comprehensive view of FHA's current and historical significance in the housing market. The summary concludes by emphasizing the ongoing relevance of FHA in providing access to homeownership for certain segments of the population, despite the complexities involved. This encapsulates the main arguments, key evidence, and unique insights presented in the passage. ```plaintext\nThe Federal Housing Administration (FHA) was established in 1934 to promote home ownership during the Great Depression by insuring mortgages", "answers": ["The Federal Housing Administration (FHA), an agency of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), was created by the National Housing Act of 1934. FHA insures private lenders against the possibility of borrowers defaulting on mortgages that meet certain criteria, thereby expanding the availability of mortgage credit beyond what may be available otherwise. If the borrower defaults on the mortgage, FHA is to repay the lender the remaining amount owed. A household that obtains an FHA-insured mortgage must meet FHA's eligibility and underwriting standards, including showing that it has sufficient income to repay a mortgage. FHA requires a minimum down payment of 3.5% from most borrowers, which is lower than the down payment required for many other types of mortgages. FHA-insured mortgages cannot exceed a statutory maximum mortgage amount, which varies by area and is based on area median house prices but cannot exceed a specified ceiling in high-cost areas. (The ceiling is set at $726,525 in high-cost areas in calendar year 2019.) Borrowers are charged fees, called mortgage insurance premiums, in exchange for the insurance. In FY2018, FHA insured over 1 million new mortgages (including both home purchase and refinance mortgages) with a combined principal balance of $209 billion. FHA's share of the mortgage market tends to vary with economic conditions and other factors. In the aftermath of the housing market turmoil that began around 2007 and a related contraction of mortgage lending, FHA insured a larger share of mortgages than it had in the preceding years. Its overall share of the mortgage market increased from about 3% in calendar year 2005 to a peak of 21% in 2009. Since that time, FHA's share of the mortgage market has decreased somewhat, though it remains higher than it was in the early 2000s. In calendar year 2017, FHA's overall share of the mortgage market was about 17%. FHA-insured mortgages, like all mortgages, experienced increased default rates during the housing downturn that began around 2007, leading to concerns about the stability of the FHA insurance fund for single-family mortgages, the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMI Fund). In response to these concerns, FHA adopted a number of policy changes in an attempt to limit risk to the MMI Fund. These changes have included raising the fees that it charges and making changes to certain eligibility criteria for FHA-insured loans."], "length": 6728}

{"pred": " \n\nThe passage discusses the challenges faced by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in aligning its services and real property portfolio to meet the needs of veterans due to geographic shifts, changes in healthcare delivery, an aging infrastructure, and limited stakeholder involvement. It highlights issues with the VA's Strategic Capital Investment Planning (SCIP) and VA Integrated Planning (VAIP) processes, which have limitations such as subjective narratives, long timeframes, and restricted access to information. The passage also mentions that the VAIP process assumes all future growth in services will be provided directly through VA facilities, which is inaccurate given that VA purchases care from non-VA providers. Additionally, the passage draws on lessons learned from the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process of the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD), suggesting that VA could benefit from adopting similar strategies for its asset and infrastructure review, including establishing clear goals, developing criteria for evaluating closures and realignments, estimating costs and savings, establishing an organizational structure, using a common analytical framework, and involving the audit community to ensure data accuracy. The passage concludes by noting that some transformational BRAC recommendations required sustained senior leadership attention and coordination among many stakeholders, and that the large number and variety of BRAC actions presented challenges during implementation. Key evidence includes statistics on the number of vacant or mostly vacant buildings and underutilized spaces in VA facilities, as well as the cost and complexity of renovating or demolishing these older facilities. The passage also emphasizes the importance of stakeholder engagement and the need for the VA to address the limitations of its planning processes to effectively align its facilities with the needs of veterans. Unique points include the suggestion that the VA could learn from the DOD's BRAC process and the identification of specific challenges faced during the implementation of BRAC recommendations. The passage provides a detailed analysis of the VA's challenges and offers practical solutions for improvement, drawing on the successful strategies employed by the DOD. The VA's failure to consistently engage stakeholders and address the limitations of its planning processes has hindered its ability to align its facilities with the needs of veterans. The passage suggests that the VA should adopt a more structured and transparent approach to facility planning, similar to the DOD's BRAC process, to overcome these challenges. The VA's facility planning processes, particularly SCIP and VAIP, have significant limitations that undermine its ability to achieve its goals, and the VA should take steps to address these limitations to improve its alignment efforts. The passage also highlights the importance of involving stakeholders", "answers": ["VA operates one of the largest health care systems in the United States, utilizing more than 6,000 federally owned and 1,500 leased buildings. DOD has repeatedly applied the BRAC process to reduce the amount of unneeded property that it owns and leases and to save billions of dollars that could be applied to higher priority defense needs. This statement is based on GAO's April 2017 report related to VA facility alignment ( GAO-17-349 ) and numerous GAO reports related to the BRAC process as summarized in a June 2011 testimony ( GAO-11-704T ) and a March 2012 testimony ( GAO-12-513T ). This statement addresses (1) the factors that affect VA's facility alignment and the extent to which VA's capital-planning process facilitates the alignment of facilities with the veterans' population, and (2) the key elements and challenges affecting DOD and the Commission in BRAC 2005. Detailed information on our scope and methodologies for this work can be found in these published products, cited throughout this testimony. Geographic shifts in the veterans' population, changes in health care delivery, aging infrastructure, and limited stakeholder involvement affect the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) efforts to align its services and real property portfolio to meet the needs of veterans. For example, a shift over time from inpatient to outpatient care will likely result in underutilized space once used for inpatient care. Further, the historic status of some VA facilities adds to the complexity of converting or disposing of them. In such instances, it is often difficult and costly for VA to modernize, renovate, and retrofit these older facilities. GAO reported that two of the planning processes VA uses to align its facilities—VA's Strategic Capital Investment Planning (SCIP) and the VA Integrated Planning (VAIP)—have limitations that undermine VA's efforts to achieve its goals. Specifically: VA relies on the SCIP process to plan and prioritize capital projects, but VA routinely asks its facility planners to submit their next year's planned project narratives before knowing if their previous submissions have been funded. The overlapping budget cycle, which is outside of VA's control, combined with other SCIP limitations—including subjective narratives, long time frames, and restricted access to information—make it difficult for VA to rely on SCIP to accurately identify the capital necessary to address its service and infrastructure gaps. VA concurred that it needs to address SCIP limitations that are within its control, as GAO recommended; VA has made some progress in implementing the recommendation has made some progress in implementing the recommendation.\\ The VAIP process is estimated to cost $108 million and to produce market-level service delivery plans and facility master plans. However, the VAIP master plans incorrectly assume that all future growth in services will be provided directly through VA facilities without considering alternatives, such as purchasing care from the community. GAO recommended that VA consider discontinuing the VAIP facility master plans pending an assessment of their value as a facility-planning tool. VA agreed with the recommendation and is implementing it while pursuing a national realignment strategy.. Key elements of the Department of Defense's (DOD) 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process could benefit VA's asset and infrastructure review. The key elements included: (1) establishing goals for the process, (2) developing criteria for evaluating closures and realignments, and (3) establishing an organizational structure to develop closure and realignment options. GAO identified key challenges that affected DOD's implementation of BRAC 2005 and the results achieved; these challenges would need to be addressed if VA is to successfully apply the process. These challenges included: (1) large, complex recommendations required sustained senior leadership's attention and a high level of coordination among many stakeholders, and (2) the large number of actions that depend on each other for successful implementation. In the April 2017 report, GAO made recommendations related to capital planning and stakeholder involvement.

Key findings include the lack of documentation for 62% of required reviews, delays in initiating reviews, and insufficient reporting to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) and state licensing boards. The passage identifies two main contributing factors: the VHA's policy and oversight inadequacies. Recommendations were made to require documentation of all reviews, establish", "answers": ["The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent federal agency established by the Communications Act of 1934 (1934 Act, or \"Communications Act\"). The agency is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable. The mission of the FCC is to make available for all people of the United States, \"without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex, a rapid, efficient, Nationwide, and worldwide wire and radio communication service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges.\" The FCC operates under a public interest mandate first laid out in the 1927 Radio Act (P.L. 632, 69th Congress), but how this mandate is applied depends on how \"the public interest\" is interpreted. Some regulators seek to protect and benefit the public at large through regulation, while others seek to achieve the same goals through the promotion of market efficiency. Additionally, Congress granted the FCC wide latitude and flexibility to revise its interpretation of the public interest standard to reflect changing circumstances and the agency has not defined it in more concrete terms. These circumstances, paired with changes in FCC leadership, have led to significant changes over time in how the FCC regulates the broadcast and telecommunications industries. The FCC is directed by five commissioners appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate for five-year terms. The President designates one of the commissioners as chairperson. Three commissioners may be members of the same political party of the President and none can have a financial interest in any commission-related business. The current commissioners are Ajit Pai (Chair), Michael O'Rielly, Brendan Carr, Jessica Rosenworcel, and Geoffrey Starks. The day-to-day functions of the FCC are carried out by 7 bureaus and 10 offices. The current basic structure of the FCC was established in 2002 as part of the agency's effort to better reflect the industries it regulates. The seventh bureau, the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau, was established in 2006. The bureaus process applications for licenses and other filings, manage non-federal spectrum, analyze complaints, conduct investigations, develop and implement regulatory programs, and participate in hearings, among other things. The offices provide support services. Bureaus and offices often collaborate when addressing FCC issues. Beginning in the 110th Congress, the FCC has been funded through the House and Senate Financial Services and General Government (FSGG) appropriations bill as a single line item. Previously, it was funded through what is now the Commerce, Justice, Science appropriations bill, also as a single line item. Since 2009 the FCC's budget has been derived from regulatory fees collected by the agency rather than through a direct appropriation. The fees, often referred to as \"Section (9) fees,\" are collected from license holders and certain other entities. The FCC is authorized to review the regulatory fees each year and adjust them to reflect changes in its appropriation from year to year. Most years, appropriations language prohibits the use by the commission of any excess collections received in the current fiscal year or any prior years. For FY2020, the FCC has requested $335,660,000 in budget authority from regulatory fee offsetting collections. The FCC also requested $132,538,680 in budget authority for the spectrum auctions program."], "length": 6810}

{"pred": " \n\nThe Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act establishes the process for states or tribal entities to request a presidential disaster declaration and defines the federal government's role in response and recovery. FEMA plays a crucial role in recommending to the President whether to declare a disaster and coordinates the federal response. The IA program provides financial and direct assistance to disaster victims, including five distinct programs: Individuals and Households, Crisis Counseling, Disaster Legal Services, Disaster Case Management, and Disaster Unemployment Assistance. FEMA uses six regulatory factors to assess IA declaration requests, which include concentration of damages, trauma, special populations, voluntary agency assistance, insurance coverage, and average amount of individual assistance by state. Despite these factors, FEMA regional offices often do not consistently document all elements of the regulatory factors in their Regional Administrator's Validation and Recommendation (RVAR). This inconsistency raises concerns about the transparency and fairness of the IA declaration process. FEMA is planning to revise the six current IA regulatory factors to provide more objective criteria and clarify eligibility thresholds. However, some states have raised concerns about the proposed changes, particularly regarding the use of state fiscal capacity and resource availability data. The report concludes that FEMA should evaluate why regions are not consistently documenting all elements of the IA regulatory factors and take corrective action if necessary. This would help ensure consistency and fairness in the IA declaration process. Key evidence includes the number of IA declarations requested, the amount of actual obligations, and the varying levels of documentation across regions. Unique points include the challenges faced by states and FEMA regions in gathering information on IA regulatory factors and the potential impact of the proposed regulatory factor revisions. The report recommends that FEMA address these issues to improve the evaluation process. The estimated completion date for the planned actions is in the fall of 2018. The summary highlights the importance of FEMA's evaluation process and the need for transparency and consistency in the IA declaration process. It also underscores the challenges faced by both FEMA and states in implementing the current regulatory framework and the potential improvements that could be made through the proposed revisions.

When a state, U.S. territory, or tribe requests IA assistance through a federal disaster declaration, FEMA evaluates the request against regulatory factors, such as concentration of damages, and provides a recommendation to the President, who makes a final declaration decision. GAO was asked to review FEMA's IA declaration process. This report examines (1) the number of IA declaration requests received, declared, and denied, and IA actual obligations from calendar years 2008 through 2016, (2) the extent to which FEMA accounts for the regulatory factors when evaluating IA requests, and (3) any challenges FEMA regions and select states reported on the declaration process and factors and any FEMA actions to revise them. GAO reviewed FEMA's policies, IA declaration requests and obligation data, and FEMA's RVARs from July 2012 through December 2016, the most recent years for which data were available. GAO also reviewed proposed rulemaking comments and interviewed FEMA officials from all 10 regions and 11 state emergency management offices selected based on declaration requests and other factors. From calendar years 2008 through 2016, the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Federal Emergency and Management Agency (FEMA) received 294 Individual Assistance (IA) declaration requests from states, U.S. territories, and tribes to help individuals meet their immediate needs after a disaster. Of these, the President declared 168 and denied 126 requests. Across the various types of IA declaration requests, severe storms (190) were the most common disaster type and drought (1) was among the least common. FEMA obligated about $8.6 billion in IA for disaster declarations during this period. GAO found that FEMA regions did not consistently obtain and document information on all elements of established IA regulatory factors when making IA recommendations to headquarters. Following a declaration request, a FEMA region is to prepare a Regional Administrator's Validation and Recommendation (RVAR)—a document designed to include data on each of the six IA regulatory factors for each declaration request as well as the regional administrator's recommendation. GAO reviewed all 81 RVARs from July 2012—the date FEMA began using the new RVAR template—through December 2016. GAO found that regions did not consistently obtain and document information for the elements required under the six regulatory factors (see table). For example, only 44 of the 81 RVARs documented all elements under the concentration of damage factor. By evaluating why regions are not completing all elements of each current IA regulatory factor, FEMA could identify whether any corrective steps are needed. Officials from the 10 FEMA regions and 11 states GAO interviewed, reported positive relationships with each other, but also cited various challenges with the IA declaration process and regulatory factors. For example, these officials told GAO that there are no established minimum thresholds for IA, making final determinations more subjective and the rationale behind denials unclear. However, as required by the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013, FEMA has taken steps to revise the IA factors by issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking. According to FEMA, the proposed rule aims to provide more objective criteria, clarify the threshold for eligibility, and speed up the IA declaration process. As of April 2018, the proposed rule was still under consideration. According to FEMA officials, they plan to finalize the rule in late 2018; therefore, it is too early to know the extent to which it will address these challenges. GAO recommends that FEMA evaluate why regions are not completing the RVARs for each element of the current IA regulatory factors and take corrective steps, if necessary.

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (VAMC) officials are responsible for reviewing the clinical care delivered by their privileged providers—physicians and dentists who are approved to independently perform specific services—after concerns are raised. The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care. For example, GAO found that after one VAMC failed to report to the NPDB or SLBs a provider who resigned to avoid an adverse privileging action, a non-VA hospital in the same city took an adverse privileging action against that same provider for the same reason 2 years later."], "length": 5918}

One type of transaction, called a swap exchange, enables GSA to apply the value of federal property to finance construction without relying on appropriated funds. Under such an exchange, GSA transfers the title of the unneeded property to a private investor after receiving the agreed upon construction services at another location. GSA proposed a swap exchange procurement for construction of a new FBI headquarters building in exchange for the Hoover Building and appropriations to compensate for the difference in value between the Hoover Building and the new building. GSA cancelled this procurement in July 2017 due to lack of funding.

Earlier this year, GAO reported the FBI is leasing space in D.C. from foreign owners. Space : In 2011, GAO reported that FBI and GSA studies showed that much of the Hoover Building is unusable. GSA noted in its fiscal year 2017 project prospectus for the FBI headquarters consolidation that the Hoover Building cannot be redeveloped to meet the FBI's current needs. Building Condition: In GAO's 2011 report, GAO noted that the condition of the Hoover Building was deteriorating, and GSA assessments identified significant recapitalization needs. Since GAO's report and in response to GAO's recommendation, GSA has evaluated its approach to maintaining the building and completed some repairs to ensure safety. GSA has limited experience in successfully completing swap exchange transactions and chose not to pursue several proposed swap exchanges, most recently the planned swap exchange for the Hoover Building. GSA has developed criteria for determining when to solicit market interest in a swap exchange, in response to recommendations in GAO's 2014 report. In addition, GSA officials told GAO that they planned to improve the swap exchange process, including the property appraisal process, outreach to stakeholders to identify potential risks associated with future projects, and to the extent possible, mitigate such risks. Nevertheless, several factors may continue to limit use of swap exchanges, including market factors, such as the availability of alternative properties and an investor's approach for valuing properties. For example, in reviewing a proposed swap exchange in Washington, D.C., GAO found in a 2016 report that the proposals from two firms valued the two federal buildings involved in the proposed swap substantially less than GSA's appraised property value. In a 2014 report, GAO identified a number of alternative approaches to funding real property projects. Congress has provided some agencies with specific authorities to use alternative funding mechanisms—including the use of private sector funds or land swaps—for the acquisition, renovation, or disposal of federal real property without full, upfront funding, though GAO has previously reported that upfront funding is the best way to ensure recognition of commitments made in budgeting decisions and maintain fiscal controls. GAO has reported that projects with alternative funding mechanisms present multiple forms of risk that are shared between the agency and any partner or stakeholder. In addition, alternative budgetary structures could be established, such as changing existing or introducing new account structures to fund real property projects. GAO has made recommendations in the past to GSA on various real property issues, including to develop additional guidance for swap exchanges and to evaluate its approach to maintaining the Hoover Building. GSA agreed with these two recommendations and addressed them."], "length": 5687}
{"pred": " \n\nFrom October 2013 to March 2017, five selected VA medical centers failed to document and conduct required reviews of 148 providers' clinical care after concerns were raised about their care, with nearly half of these reviews lacking documentation. The VA medical centers also did not always conduct these reviews in a timely manner, with some taking up to multiple years to begin. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) lacks adequate oversight and policy requirements for documenting and conducting these reviews, leading to insufficient information for making decisions about providers' privileges and a lack of assurance that all providers with clinical deficiencies are reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) and state licensing boards. The VA needs to implement stronger oversight and policy requirements to ensure that all reviews are documented and completed in a timely manner, and that providers with deficiencies are reported to the NPDB and state licensing boards. The VA's failure to report providers to these entities allows substandard care providers to obtain privileges at other VA medical centers or hospitals outside of VA's health care system. The GAO recommends that the VA require documentation of all reviews, establish timeliness requirements, and strengthen oversight to ensure that providers with deficiencies are reported. The VA concurred with these recommendations and plans to revise policy and update the standardized audit tool to include more comprehensive oversight of VA medical centers' reviews of providers' clinical care after concerns have been raised. The VA also plans to require networks to oversee VA medical centers to ensure that such reviews are documented and initiated in a timely manner and that providers are reported to the NPDB and state licensing boards as required. The VA's failure to report providers to the NPDB and state licensing boards as required facilitates providers who provide substandard care at one facility obtaining privileges at another VA medical center or at hospitals outside of VA's health care system. The GAO found several cases of this occurring among the providers who were not reported to the NPDB or state licensing boards by the five VA medical centers reviewed. The VA's inadequate oversight and policy requirements for documenting and conducting reviews of providers' clinical care and reporting providers to the NPDB and state licensing boards pose risks to veterans' safety and the integrity of the VA healthcare system. The GAO's findings highlight the need for the VA to improve its oversight and policy requirements to ensure that all providers with clinical deficiencies are identified and reported, and that the VA healthcare system remains free from substandard care providers.

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (VAMC) officials are responsible for reviewing the clinical care delivered by their privileged providers—physicians and dentists who are approved to independently perform specific services—after concerns are raised. The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care. For example, GAO found that after one VAMC failed to report to the NPDB or SLBs a provider who resigned to avoid an adverse privileging action, a non-VA hospital in the same city took an adverse privileging action against that same provider for the same reason 2 years later."], "length": 6810}

{"pred": " \n\nThe federal government owns approximately 640 million acres, primarily in the western states, managed by four agencies: National Park Service (NPS), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and U.S. Forest Service (USFS). These agencies have varying authorities to acquire and dispose of federal lands. The NPS lacks general authority to acquire new lands, while the BLM has broad authority to acquire and dispose of lands. The FWS can acquire lands but cannot dispose of them without Congressional approval, except through exchanges or if lands are no longer needed. The USFS has limited acquisition and disposal authorities, mainly for lands within or contiguous to national forests. Congress often debates the adequacy and use of these authorities, and various bills propose modifications or eliminations. Funding for land acquisition comes primarily from the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), with additional sources like the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund (MBCF) for specific agencies. The BLM has broad land disposal authorities, including exchanges, sales, and transfers, while the NPS, FWS, and USFS have more limited disposal authorities. Key evidence includes the varying acquisition and disposal authorities granted by Congress and the specific laws governing each agency's actions. Unique points include the importance of the MBCF for FWS land acquisitions and the broad land disposal authorities of the BLM. Congress frequently considers legislation to address the extent of federal land ownership and funding mechanisms for land acquisition. The BLM's Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act provides a significant revenue stream for land acquisition and development in Nevada. The General Mining Law of 1872, though still in effect, has been largely suspended due to annual moratoria since FY1995. The FWS's Migratory Bird Conservation Act and the USFS's various acquisition authorities are notable for their predictability and permanence in funding. The NPS's inability to dispose of lands without Congressional approval highlights the strict preservation focus of the agency. The BLM's ability to use eminent domain for land acquisition and its broad land disposal authorities underscore the agency's role in balancing resource management and public access. The varying authorities and funding mechanisms reflect the complex interplay between federal land management and public policy. The passage outlines the diverse authorities and funding mechanisms for federal land management agencies, emphasizing the unique roles and constraints of each agency in acquiring and disposing of federal lands. The BLM stands out with its broadest authorities, while the NPS has the narrowest. Congress plays a", "answers": ["The federal government owns roughly 640 million acres, heavily concentrated in 12 western states. Four agencies—the National Park Service (NPS), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in the Department of the Interior, and the U.S. Forest Service (FS) in the Department of Agriculture—administer about 95% of those lands. The extent to which each of these four federal agencies have authority to acquire and dispose of land varies considerably. The BLM has relatively broad authority for both acquisitions and disposals under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA). The agency also has other authorities for disposing of land, including two laws that allow the agency to retain the proceeds for subsequent land acquisition, among other purposes, and a law that allows transfers to governmental units and other entities for public purposes. By contrast, the NPS has no general authority to acquire land to create new park units or to dispose of park lands. The FS authority to acquire lands is mostly limited to lands within or contiguous to the boundaries of a national forest. The agency has various authorities to dispose of land, but they are relatively constrained and infrequently used. The FWS has various authorities to acquire lands but no general authority to dispose of its lands. The agency frequently uses acquisition authority under the Migratory Bird Conservation Act of 1929 because of the availability of funding through the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund. The nature of the acquisition and disposal authorities of the four federal agencies also varies. In general, the acquisition authorities are designed to allow the four agencies to bring into federal ownership lands that many contend could benefit from federal management. Disposal authorities generally are designed to allow agencies to convey land that is no longer needed for a federal purpose or that might be chiefly valuable for another purpose. Some of the authorities specify particular circumstances where they can be used, such as the conveyance of FS land for educational purposes and the disposal of BLM land for recreation and public purposes. Congress often faces questions on the adequacy of existing acquisition and disposal authorities; the nature, extent, and location of their use; and the extent of federal land ownership overall. The current acquisition and disposal authorities form the backdrop for consideration of measures to establish, modify, or eliminate authorities, or to provide for the acquisition or disposal of particular lands. In some cases, Congress enacts bills to provide authority to acquire or dispose of particular parcels where no standing authority exists and, in other cases, to direct or facilitate land transactions. Congress also addresses acquisition and disposal policy in the context of debates on the role and goals of the federal government in owning and managing land generally, and it has considered broader measures to dispose of lands or to promote acquisition. Other issues for Congress pertain to the sources and levels of funds for land acquisition. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) is the primary source of funding for land acquisition. Congress has considered diverse measures related to the LWCF, such as legislation to make LWCF funding permanent and bills to direct LWCF monies to additional, nonacquisition purposes. Additionally, the FWS has the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund, an account with mandatory spending authority supported by revenue from three sources. The BLM also has mandatory spending authorities that allow the proceeds from land sales to be used for land acquisition, among other purposes."], "length": 6617}

The procedure is commonly used for widely supported legislation and covers a wide range of policy areas, particularly government operations. Data from the 114th Congress show that 62% of measures considered on the House floor were under suspension, with 94% being bills, mostly sponsored by the majority party. The suspension procedure is flexible, allowing for the inclusion of committee amendments or informal negotiations, and can be initiated on specific days or through unanimous consent. Despite its limitations, the suspension procedure remains a crucial tool for passing legislation in the House, with nearly all measures ultimately passing.

The suspension procedure is", "answers": ["Suspension of the rules is the most commonly used procedure to call up measures on the floor of the House of Representatives. As the name suggests, the procedure allows the House to suspend its standing and statutory rules in order to consider broadly supported legislation in an expedited manner. More specifically, the House temporarily sets aside its rules that govern the raising and consideration of measures and assumes a new set of constraints particular to the suspension procedure. The suspension of the rules procedure has several parliamentary advantages: (1) it allows nonprivileged measures to be raised on the House floor without the need for a special rule, (2) it enables the consideration of measures that would otherwise be subject to a point of order, and (3) it streamlines floor action by limiting debate and prohibiting floor amendments. Given these features, as well as the required two-thirds supermajority vote for passage, suspension motions are generally used to process less controversial legislation. In the 114th Congress (2015-2016), measures considered under suspension made up 62% of the bills and resolutions that received floor action in the House (743 out of 1,200 measures). The majority of suspension measures were House bills (83%), followed by Senate bills (11%) and House resolutions (4%). The measures covered a variety of policy areas but most often addressed government operations, such as the designation of federal facilities or amending administrative policies. Most measures that are considered in the House under the suspension procedure are sponsored by a House or Senate majority party member. However, suspension is the most common House procedure used to consider minority-party-sponsored legislation regardless of whether the legislation originated in the House or Senate. In 2015 and 2016, minority-party members sponsored 31% of suspension measures, compared to 9% of legislation subject to different procedures, including privileged business (17 measures), unanimous consent (21 measures), and under the terms of a special rule (one Senate bill). Most suspension measures are referred to at least one House committee before their consideration on the floor. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform (now called the Committee on Oversight and Reform) was the committee of primary jurisdiction for the plurality of suspension measures considered in the 114th Congress. Additional committees—such as Energy and Commerce, Homeland Security, Natural Resources, Foreign Affairs, and Veterans' Affairs—also served as the primary committee for a large number of suspension measures. Suspension motions are debatable for up to 40 minutes. In most cases, only a fraction of that debate time is actually used. In the 114th Congress, the average amount of time spent considering a motion to suspend the rules was 13 minutes and 10 seconds. The House adopted nearly every suspension motion considered in 2015 and 2016. Approval by the House, however, did not guarantee final approval in the 114th Congress. The Senate passed or agreed to 40% of the bills, joint resolutions, and concurrent resolutions initially considered in the House under suspension of the rules, and 276 measures were signed into law.

In accordance with the DHS Appropriations Act, 2007, DHS established the CFATS program in 2007 to, among other things, identify and assess the security risk posed by chemical facilities. DHS inspects high-risk facilities after it approves facility security plans to ensure that the facilities are implementing required security measures and procedures. This statement summarizes progress and challenges related to DHS's CFATS program management. This statement is based on prior products GAO issued from July 2012 through June 2017, along with updates conducted in June 2018 on DHS actions to address prior GAO recommendations. To conduct the prior work, GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and DHS policies for administering the CFATS program, how DHS assesses risk, and data on high-risk chemical facilities. GAO also interviewed DHS officials and reviewed information on DHS actions to implement its prior recommendations. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has made progress addressing challenges that GAO's past work identified to managing the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) program. The following summarizes progress made and challenges remaining in key aspects of the program. Identifying high-risk chemical facilities. In July 2015, GAO reported that DHS used self-reported and unverified data to determine the risk of facilities holding toxic chemicals that could threaten surrounding communities if released. GAO recommended that DHS should better verify the accuracy of facility-reported data. DHS implemented this recommendation by revising its methodology so it now calculates the risk of toxic release, rather than relying on facilities to do so. Assessing risk and prioritizing facilities. In April 2013, GAO reported weaknesses in multiple aspects of DHS's risk assessment and prioritization approach. GAO made two recommendations for DHS to review and improve this process, including that DHS enhance its risk assessment approach to incorporate all of the elements of consequence, threat, and vulnerability associated with a terrorist attack involving certain chemicals. DHS launched a new risk assessment methodology in October 2016 and is currently gathering new or updated data from about 27,000 facilities to (1) determine which facilities should be categorized as high-risk because of the threat of sabotage, theft or diversion, or a toxic release and (2) assign those facilities deemed high risk to one of four risk-based tiers. GAO has ongoing work assessing these efforts and will report later this summer on the extent to which they fully address prior recommendations. Reviewing and approving facilities' site security plans . DHS is to review security plans and visit facilities to ensure their security measures meet DHS standards. In April 2013, GAO reported a 7 to 9 year backlog for these reviews and visits. In July 2015, GAO reported that DHS had made substantial progress in addressing the backlog—estimating that it could take between 9 and 12 months for DHS to review and approve security plans for the approximately 900 remaining facilities. DHS has since taken additional action to expedite these activities and has eliminated this backlog. Inspecting facilities and ensuring compliance. In July 2015, GAO reported that DHS conducted compliance inspections at 83 of the 1,727 facilities with approved security plans. GAO found that nearly half of the inspected facilities were not fully compliant with their approved security plans and that DHS did not have documented procedures for managing facilities' compliance. GAO recommended that DHS document procedures for managing compliance. As a result, DHS has developed an enforcement procedure and a draft compliance inspection procedure and expects to finalize the compliance inspection procedure by the end of fiscal year 2018. GAO has made various recommendations to strengthen DHS's management of the CFATS program, with which DHS has generally agreed. DHS has implemented or described planned actions to address most of these recommendations."], "length": 6338}

In accordance with the DHS Appropriations Act, 2007, DHS established the CFATS program in 2007 to, among other things, identify and assess the security risk posed by chemical facilities. DHS inspects high-risk facilities after it approves facility security plans to ensure that the facilities are implementing required security measures and procedures. This statement summarizes progress and challenges related to DHS's CFATS program management. This statement is based on prior products GAO issued from July 2012 through June 2017, along with updates conducted in June 2018 on DHS actions to address prior GAO recommendations. To conduct the prior work, GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and DHS policies for administering the CFATS program, how DHS assesses risk, and data on high-risk chemical facilities. GAO also interviewed DHS officials and reviewed information on DHS actions to implement its prior recommendations. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has made progress addressing challenges that GAO's past work identified to managing the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) program. The following summarizes progress made and challenges remaining in key aspects of the program. Identifying high-risk chemical facilities. In July 2015, GAO reported that DHS used self-reported and unverified data to determine the risk of facilities holding toxic chemicals that could threaten surrounding communities if released. GAO recommended that DHS should better verify the accuracy of facility-reported data. DHS implemented this recommendation by revising its methodology so it now calculates the risk of toxic release, rather than relying on facilities to do so. Assessing risk and prioritizing facilities. In April 2013, GAO reported weaknesses in multiple aspects of DHS's risk assessment and prioritization approach. GAO made two recommendations for DHS to review and improve this process, including that DHS enhance its risk assessment approach to incorporate all of the elements of consequence, threat, and vulnerability associated with a terrorist attack involving certain chemicals. DHS launched a new risk assessment methodology in October 2016 and is currently gathering new or updated data from about 27,000 facilities to (1) determine which facilities should be categorized as high-risk because of the threat of sabotage, theft or diversion, or a toxic release and (2) assign those facilities deemed high risk to one of four risk-based tiers. GAO has ongoing work assessing these efforts and will report later this summer on the extent to which they fully address prior recommendations. Reviewing and approving facilities' site security plans . DHS is to review security plans and visit facilities to ensure their security measures meet DHS standards. In April 2013, GAO reported a 7 to 9 year backlog for these reviews and visits. In July 2015, GAO reported that DHS had made substantial progress in addressing the backlog—estimating that it could take between 9 and 12 months for DHS to review and approve security plans for the approximately 900 remaining facilities. DHS has since taken additional action to expedite these activities and has eliminated this backlog. Inspecting facilities and ensuring compliance. In July 2015, GAO reported that DHS conducted compliance inspections at 83 of the 1,727 facilities with approved security plans. GAO found that nearly half of the inspected facilities were not fully compliant with their approved security plans and that DHS did not have documented procedures for managing facilities' compliance. GAO recommended that DHS document procedures for managing compliance. As a result, DHS has developed an enforcement procedure and a draft compliance inspection procedure and expects to finalize the compliance inspection procedure by the end of fiscal year 2018. GAO has made various recommendations to strengthen DHS's management of the CFATS program, with which DHS has generally agreed. DHS has implemented or described planned actions to address most of these recommendations."], "length": 5639}

{"pred": " \n\nPassage 1 discusses the use of user fees and charges by the federal government as a means of raising revenue. It explains that user fees are voluntary payments made by individuals or businesses for specific services or benefits provided by the government, such as park entry fees or regulatory inspections. The passage highlights that user fees can be advantageous as they connect the cost of services to those who benefit from them and can decentralize decision-making. However, it also notes potential drawbacks, such as the fluctuation of revenue based on economic conditions and concerns about bypassing congressional scrutiny. The passage outlines the different types of user fees, their legal basis, and how they are accounted for in the federal budget. It concludes by discussing the economic principles behind user fees, such as the benefit principle, and the challenges in applying these principles to various government services. The passage also touches on the potential for user fees to influence agency priorities and the need for careful oversight to ensure fair and efficient use of these fees. Key evidence includes statistics on the scale of user fees ($331 billion in FY2017) and the varying degrees of discretion allowed in setting and collecting fees. Unique points include the distinction between user fees and other forms of government revenue, such as taxes, and the importance of regular reviews and adjustments to ensure the effectiveness and fairness of user fee systems. The passage emphasizes the complexity of designing user fees that accurately reflect the benefits received by users and the broader economic implications of such fees. The main argument is that while user fees offer certain advantages, careful consideration and oversight are necessary to ensure they are fair, efficient, and aligned with broader public interests. The passage also suggests that the structure and administration of federal inspection and regulation plays a central role in enhancing efficiency and minimizing burdens relative to benefits. The conclusion underscores the need for ongoing evaluation and adjustment of user fee systems to maintain their effectiveness and fairness.

The conclusion underscores the need for ongoing evaluation and adjustment of user fee systems to maintain their effectiveness and fairness. The summary is concise and focuses on the most important information from the passage, highlighting the key arguments, evidence, and unique", "answers": ["The federal government collects various fees from businesses and households. Choosing to raise public funds via user fees, as opposed to other means such as taxes, has important administrative and economic consequences. Many fees stem from \"business-like activities,\" in which the government provides a service or benefit in return for payment. For example, many national parks charge entry fees, which then help fund maintenance projects. Such fees and charges that result from voluntary choices, such as entering a national park, are distinguished from taxes—which stem from the government's sovereign power to compel payments. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) defines a user fee as a \"fee assessed to users for goods or services provided by the federal government. User fees generally apply to federal programs or activities that provide special benefits to identifiable recipients above and beyond what is normally available to the public.\" User fees and charges have several advantages as a means of financing public activities. They are voluntary, they connect the burden of financing activities to those who directly benefit from them, and can help decentralize decisionmaking by bypassing centralized allocation of resources. Some have expressed concerns that user fee arrangements may bypass regular congressional scrutiny and dilute Congress's power of the purse. Collections of fees and charges may also be more sensitive to economic fluctuations, which could complicate financing of programs dependent on those revenue streams. Many user fees or charges are classified as offsetting collections, which are deposited into expenditure accounts. Offsetting collections can be used to offset agency spending and typically require no further congressional approval to use. Other fees and charges are classified as offsetting receipts, which are collected into revenue accounts and typically require congressional authorization to be spent. User fees and charges can be classified as discretionary or mandatory spending, depending on how they are legally authorized. The levels and administration of some fees are specified in detailed statutory text, while other fees are created under broader agency authorities. Certain agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), have increased their reliance on user fees in past decades. Some critics have raised concerns that increased reliance on user fees could shift incentives facing those agencies. Some legislative proposals, such as H.R. 850 introduced in the 115th Congress, would limit or eliminate most exceptions and require most fees and charges to be deposited in the U.S. Treasury General Fund. Congress could fund agencies and activities now funded in whole or in part via user fees directly through the annual appropriations process. Such proposals would mark a departure from past practice. Statutory text governing many fees has evolved over many years and involves substantive policy decisions, often related to the industry or programmatic concerns. A general change in funding from user fees and charges to annual appropriations would likely shift the division of responsibilities between authorizing committees and appropriations committees. Congress may also enhance its oversight of agencies reliant on user fees by requiring more timely and detailed financial reports as well as more precise and systematic explanations of linkages between those fees and associated programs. Congress could also ask for greater transparency in fiscal data. While the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the U.S. Treasury Bureau of the Fiscal Service provide extensive data on user fees and charges, it is difficult to conduct governmentwide analyses using publicly available sources. Congress could mandate more detailed and more easily accessed data on user fees and charges. Additional funding may be needed to develop the capacity to issue those data."], "length": 7015}

Key", "answers": ["The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant funds a wide range of benefits and services for low-income families with children. TANF was created in the 1996 welfare reform law (P.L. 104-193). This report responds to some frequently asked questions about TANF; it does not describe TANF rules (see, instead, CRS Report RL32748, The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Block Grant: A Primer on TANF Financing and Federal Requirements, by Gene Falk). TANF Funding and Expenditures. TANF provides fixed funding for the 50 states, the District of Columbia, the territories, and American Indian tribes. The basic block grant totals $16.5 billion per year. States are also required in total to contribute, from their own funds, at least $10.3 billion annually under a maintenance-of-effort (MOE) requirement. Though TANF is best known for funding cash assistance payments for needy families with children, the block grant and MOE funds are used for a wide variety of benefits and activities. In FY2017, expenditures on basic assistance totaled $7.1 billion—23% of total federal TANF and MOE dollars. Basic assistance is often—but not exclusively—paid as cash. In addition to funding basic assistance, TANF also contributes funds for child care and services for children who have been, or are at risk of being, abused and neglected. Some states also count expenditures in prekindergarten programs toward the MOE requirement. The TANF Assistance Caseload. A total of 1.2 million families, composed of 3.1 million recipients, received TANF- or MOE-funded assistance in September 2018. The bulk of the \"recipients\" were children—2.3 million in that month. The assistance caseload is heterogeneous. The type of family once thought of as the \"typical\" assistance family—one with an unemployed adult recipient—accounted for 32% of all families on the rolls in FY2016. Additionally, 31% of cash assistance families had an employed adult, while 38% of all TANF families were \"child-only\" and had no adult recipient. Child-only families include those with disabled adults receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI), adults who are nonparents (e.g., grandparents, aunts, uncles) caring for children, and families consisting of citizen children and ineligible noncitizen parents. Cash Assistance Benefits. TANF cash benefit amounts are set by states. In July 2017, the maximum monthly benefit for a family of three ranged from $1,021 in New Hampshire to $170 in Mississippi. Only New Hampshire (at 60% of the federal poverty guidelines) had a maximum TANF cash assistance amount for this sized family in excess of 50% of poverty-level income. Work Requirements. TANF's main federal work requirement is actually a performance measure that applies to the states. States determine the work rules that apply to individual recipients. TANF law requires states to engage 50% of all families and 90% of two-parent families with work-eligible individuals in work activities, though these standards can be reduced by \"credits.\" Therefore, the effective standards states face are often less than the 50% or 90% targets, and vary by state. In FY2017, states achieved, on average, an all-family participation rate of 53.0% and a two-parent rate of 69.5%. In FY2017, two jurisdictions did not meet the all-family participation standard: Nevada and Guam. This is a reduction from FY2012, when 16 states did not meet that standard. In FY2017, nine jurisdictions did not meet the two-parent standard. States that do not meet work standards are at risk of being penalized by a reduction in their block grant."], "length": 7198}

{"pred": " \n\nThe passage discusses significant issues with the documentation and timeliness of reviews of providers' clinical care at five selected VA medical centers from October 2013 through March 2017. The VA medical centers lacked documentation for nearly half of the required reviews, and in some cases, reviews were not conducted at all. Specifically, focused professional practice evaluations (FPPEs) for cause and retrospective reviews were often missing documentation. Additionally, reviews were frequently delayed, with some taking up to multiple years to begin. The passage identifies two main causes for these issues: insufficient VHA policy requirements for documentation and oversight, and a lack of routine oversight by network officials. The VA medical centers also failed to report providers to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) and state licensing boards as required, due to a combination of policy misinterpretations and inadequate oversight by VHA. The passage recommends that VHA require documentation of all reviews, establish timeliness requirements, and strengthen oversight to ensure compliance. VHA concurred with these recommendations and outlined plans to implement them. The passage highlights the importance of proper documentation and timely reviews for ensuring patient safety and preventing substandard care providers from obtaining privileges at other facilities. The unique aspect of the passage is the detailed breakdown of the specific types of reviews lacking documentation and the timeline for initiating them, which underscores the systemic nature of the problem. The passage also emphasizes the broader implications of these issues, such as the potential for substandard care providers to continue practicing at other facilities. The supporting data includes statistics on the number of providers requiring reviews and the delays in initiating these reviews, as well as examples of providers who were not reported to the NPDB or state licensing boards despite documented deficiencies in their clinical performance. The passage concludes by noting that the VA medical centers' actions, or lack thereof, could compromise patient safety and hinder efforts to improve healthcare quality within the VA system.

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (VAMC) officials are responsible for reviewing the clinical care delivered by their privileged providers—physicians and dentists who are approved to independently perform specific services—after concerns are raised. The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care. For example, GAO found that after one VAMC failed to report to the NPDB or SLBs a provider who resigned to avoid an adverse privileging action, a non-VA hospital in the same city took an adverse privileging action against that same provider for the same reason 2 years later."], "length": 6968}
{"pred": " \n\nPassage 2 discusses the challenges in estimating cancer risks from low-dose radiation exposure and the approaches taken by federal agencies to protect public health. The National Academies' 2006 report suggests a simple proportionate relationship between radiation at low doses and cancer risk, but uncertainties remain due to limited data on chronic, low-dose exposure. Federal agencies, such as NRC, EPA, and FDA, rely on the linear no-threshold model, which assumes a continuous increase in cancer risk with radiation exposure, despite uncertainties. NRC and EPA adhere to this model until compelling evidence emerges. The passage highlights that while federal agencies have established dose limits for radiation exposure, these limits are below the National Academies' definition of low dose. Additionally, the passage notes that while some agencies, like NRC, apply the principle of making every reasonable effort to minimize radiation exposure (ALARA), others, like FDA, focus on regulating the maximum radiation output of medical equipment. Finally, the passage mentions that federal agencies have decreased funding for research on the health effects of low-dose radiation, with DOE and NIH accounting for most of the funding reductions. Despite this, the agencies have collaborated on specific research projects but not on overall research priorities. The passage concludes by recommending that the Secretary of Energy lead the development of a mechanism for interagency collaboration to address shared research priorities in low-dose radiation health effects, although DOE did not agree with this recommendation. The key evidence includes the linear no-threshold model's reliance on limited data and the decreasing funding for low-dose radiation research. Unique points include the application of ALARA principles by NRC and the focus of FDA on regulating medical equipment radiation output rather than total patient exposure.

These settings were: (1) the operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants; (2) the cleanup of sites with radiological contamination; (3) the use of medical equipment that produces radiation; and (4) accidental or terrorism-related exposure to radiation. Specifically, the agencies relied on the advice of three scientific advisory bodies that supported the use of a model that assumes the risk of cancer increases with every incremental radiation exposure. Accordingly, the agencies have set regulatory dose limits and issued guidance to confine exposure to levels that reduce the risk of cancer, while recognizing that scientific uncertainties occur in estimating cancer risks from low-dose radiation.

{"pred": " \n\nPassage 2 discusses the approach federal agencies take towards regulating radiation exposure, particularly low-dose radiation. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's 2006 report on radiation and human health suggests that the risk of cancer increases with every incremental increase in radiation exposure, a concept known as the linear no-threshold model. Federal agencies like the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of Energy (DOE), and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rely on this model to set dose limits for radiation exposure. For instance, the NRC sets an annual dose limit for the public that is significantly lower than what is considered low dose by the National Academies. The passage also notes that while the health effects of low-dose radiation are challenging to estimate accurately, federal agencies continue to use the linear no-threshold model due to the lack of convincing evidence suggesting otherwise. Additionally, the passage highlights that federal agencies have been reducing their funding for research on the health effects of low-dose radiation, with a significant decrease observed from fiscal year 2012 to 2016. Despite this, the agencies have collaborated on specific research projects but have not established a collaborative mechanism to address overall research priorities. The passage concludes by noting that the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommended that the Department of Energy (DOE) lead the development of a mechanism for interagency collaboration to address these research priorities, although DOE did not agree with this recommendation. The GAO believes that DOE is well-positioned to lead such an effort due to its historical role in advocating for better communication and coordination between radiation biology and epidemiology fields. The GAO also emphasized that this recommendation does not replace the agencies' existing legal mandates and budget authorities.

{"pred": " \n\nThe passage discusses the Payment Error Rate Measurement (PERM) system used by CMS to estimate the national Medicaid improper payment rate, focusing particularly on Medicaid managed care. The PERM calculates the improper payment rate through a 17-state, 3-year rotation cycle and measures errors in FFS claims, managed care capitated payments, and eligibility determinations. While the PERM shows a lower improper payment rate for Medicaid managed care compared to FFS, it does not account for key program integrity risks such as overpayments to providers and unallowable MCO costs. The passage highlights that despite CMS's efforts to improve oversight, these risks remain unaddressed, leading to potential inaccuracies in the PERM estimates. Key evidence includes findings from 27 audits and investigations that identified over $200 million in MCO overpayments and unallowable costs, which were not captured in the PERM. The passage concludes by recommending that CMS consider revising the PERM methodology or focusing additional audit resources on managed care to better measure program risks. The unique point is that the PERM's lower improper payment rate for managed care may not reflect actual program integrity risks due to its limited scope and failure to account for overpayments and unallowable costs. The passage also notes that CMS's current oversight efforts, including Focused Program Integrity Reviews and collaborative audits, fall short of mitigating these risks. The overall conclusion is that better measurement of program risks is crucial to ensure the integrity of Medicaid managed care programs. The PERM's methodology, while approved by OMB, likely underestimates the true risks in Medicaid managed care, necessitating a more comprehensive approach to program integrity oversight. The passage emphasizes the importance of addressing these risks to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse in Medicaid managed care. The key recommendation is for CMS to take steps to mitigate the unaccounted risks, such as revising the PERM methodology or increasing audit resources. The passage concludes by noting that HHS concurred with the recommendation but maintained that the PERM is not intended to measure all Medicaid program integrity risks. The unique aspect is the emphasis on the need for a more thorough assessment of program integrity risks in Medicaid managed care to ensure accurate targeting of program integrity activities. The passage underscores the critical nature of this issue given the growing expenditures for Medicaid managed care. The summary ends by highlighting the ongoing need for improved oversight and measurement of program integrity risks in Medicaid managed care to ensure the integrity of the entire Medicaid program. The summary focuses on the main arguments, key evidence, and", "answers": ["The improper payment rate is a sentinel measure of program integrity risks for the Medicaid program. CMS and the states oversee Medicaid, whose size, structure, and diversity make it vulnerable to improper payments. CMS estimates the Medicaid improper payment rate annually through its PERM, which includes an estimate for Medicaid managed care, in which states contract with MCOs to provide services to Medicaid enrollees. GAO was asked to study the PERM methodology for managed care. In this report, GAO examined the extent to which the PERM accounts for program integrity risks in Medicaid managed care, including CMS's and states' oversight. GAO identified program integrity risks reported in 27 federal and state audits and investigations issued between January 2012 and September 2017; reviewed federal regulations and guidance on the PERM and CMS's Focused Program Integrity Reviews; and contacted program integrity officials in the 16 states with a majority of 2016 Medicaid spending for managed care, as well as CMS officials and program integrity experts. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) estimate of improper payments for Medicaid managed care has limitations that are not mitigated by the agency's and states' current oversight efforts. One component of the Payment Error Rate Measurement (PERM) measures the accuracy of capitated payments, which are periodic payments that state Medicaid agencies make to managed care organizations (MCO) to provide services to enrollees and to cover other allowable costs, such as administrative expenses. However, the managed care component of the PERM neither includes a medical review of services delivered to enrollees, nor reviews of MCO records or data. Further, GAO's review of the 27 federal and state audits and investigations identified key program risks. Ten of the 27 federal and state audits and investigations identified about $68 million in overpayments and unallowable MCO costs that were not accounted for by PERM estimates; another of these investigations resulted in a $137.5 million settlement. These audits and investigations were conducted over more than 5 years and involved a small fraction of the more than 270 MCOs operating nationwide as of September 2017. To the extent that overpayments and unallowable costs are unidentified and not removed from the cost data used to set capitation rates, they may allow inflated MCO payments and minimize the appearance of program risks in Medicaid managed care. CMS and states have taken steps to improve oversight of Medicaid managed care through updated regulations, focused reviews of states' managed care programs, and federal program integrity contractors' audits of managed care services. However, some of these efforts went into effect only recently, and others are unlikely to address the risks in managed care across all states. Furthermore, these efforts do not ensure the identification and reporting of overpayments to providers and unallowable costs by MCOs. Federal internal control standards call for agency management to identify and respond to risks. Without addressing key risks, such as the extent of overpayments and unallowable costs, CMS cannot be certain that its estimated improper payment rate for managed care (0.3 percent compared with 12.9 percent in Medicaid fee-for-service) accurately reflects program risks. The Administrator of CMS should consider and take steps to mitigate the program risks that are not measured in the PERM, such as overpayments and unallowable costs; such an effort could include actions such as revising the PERM methodology or focusing additional audit resources on managed care. HHS concurred with this recommendation. HHS also provided technical comments, which were incorporated as appropriate."], "length": 5838}
{"pred": " \n\nThis patent describes a novel method for validating computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of blood flow in vascular segments during angiography examinations. The method involves obtaining a 3D image dataset of the examination region, generating a 3D vascular model, capturing contrast agent propagation via dynamic 2D angiography, inputting blood flow parameters, performing a CFD simulation, generating virtual 2D angiography, and determining a degree of correspondence between real and virtual angiographies. The key innovation lies in using the degree of correspondence to iteratively optimize the CFD simulation, thereby improving the accuracy of the simulation results. The method addresses the challenge of validating CFD simulations for individual patients, where critical parameters like blood flow and pressure are not precisely known. By aligning the virtual angiography with the real angiography, the method allows for adjustments to the simulation parameters to better match the real-world scenario. This iterative process ensures that the CFD simulation results are more reliable and accurate for clinical applications, particularly in the context of aneurysm assessment and treatment planning. The method is supported by references to existing techniques and studies that highlight the limitations of current validation methods, underscoring the need for a more robust approach. The unique aspect of this method is its ability to use dynamic angiography data to guide the optimization of CFD simulations, making it a significant advancement in the field of medical imaging and computational fluid dynamics. The method is applicable to various types of angiography systems and can be adapted to different vascular segments and aneurysms, providing a flexible and versatile solution for improving the accuracy of CFD simulations in clinical practice. The patent also outlines specific steps for calculating the degree of correspondence and adjusting the simulation parameters, ensuring a systematic and reproducible approach to optimizing the CFD simulations. The method's effectiveness is demonstrated through its potential to enhance the accuracy of blood flow simulations, which is crucial for understanding aneurysm dynamics and developing effective treatment strategies. The iterative optimization process allows for continuous refinement of the simulation, leading to more precise predictions of blood flow behavior in complex vascular structures. This, in turn, can improve the safety and efficacy of interventions aimed at preventing aneurysm-related complications. The method's applicability to various types of angiography systems and vascular segments makes it a valuable tool for researchers and clinicians working in the field of medical imaging and vascular disease management.

The VA medical centers also did not always conduct these reviews in a timely manner, with some taking up to multiple years to begin. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) lacks adequate oversight and policy requirements for documenting and conducting these reviews, leading to insufficient information for making decisions about providers' privileges and a lack of assurance that all providers with clinical deficiencies are reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) and state licensing boards. The VA needs to implement stronger oversight and policy requirements to ensure that all reviews are documented and completed in a timely manner, and that providers with deficiencies are reported to the NPDB and state licensing boards. The VA's failure to report providers to these entities allows substandard care providers to obtain privileges at other VA medical centers or hospitals outside of VA's health care system. The GAO recommends that the VA require documentation of all reviews, establish timeliness requirements, and strengthen oversight to ensure that providers with deficiencies are reported. The VA concurred with these recommendations and plans to revise policy and update the standardized audit tool to include more comprehensive oversight of VA medical centers' reviews of providers' clinical care after concerns have been raised. The VA also plans to require networks to oversee VA medical centers to ensure that such reviews are documented and initiated in a timely manner and that providers are reported to the NPDB and state licensing boards as required.

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (VAMC) officials are responsible for reviewing the clinical care delivered by their privileged providers—physicians and dentists who are approved to independently perform specific services—after concerns are raised. The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care. For example, GAO found that after one VAMC failed to report to the NPDB or SLBs a provider who resigned to avoid an adverse privileging action, a non-VA hospital in the same city took an adverse privileging action against that same provider for the same reason 2 years later."], "length": 6810}

{"pred": " \n\nThe passage discusses the challenges and approaches to managing low-dose radiation exposure and its health effects, particularly focusing on the use of the linear no-threshold model for estimating cancer risks from radiation exposure. Key points include:\n\n1. The linear no-threshold model assumes that any increase in radiation exposure leads to an increase in cancer risk, even at very low doses. This model is widely adopted by regulatory bodies like the National Academies, NRC, EPA, and FDA, despite uncertainties in estimating cancer risks from very low doses of radiation.\n\n2. Federal agencies, such as NRC, EPA, and FDA, set dose limits for radiation exposure that are below the level considered low dose by the National Academies. For instance, NRC's annual dose limit for the public from nuclear power plants is a hundredth of the level defined as low dose by the National Academies.\n\n3. The passage notes that while there is a general consensus on the use of the linear no-threshold model, there is still uncertainty regarding the exact dose-response relationship for very low doses of radiation. This uncertainty is partly due to the limited data available from chronic, low-dose exposure scenarios, such as those experienced by U.S. populations.\n\n4. Despite the challenges, regulatory bodies continue to rely on the linear no-threshold model because there is no convincing evidence that low levels of radiation are beneficial or not harmful. Agencies like NRC and EPA will only consider changing their approach if there is strong scientific support for doing so.\n\n5. The passage highlights that while there is ongoing research on the health effects of low-dose radiation, the funding for such research has decreased over the past five years. This reduction in funding could impact the ability to refine our understanding of the risks associated with low-dose radiation exposure.\n\n6. The passage concludes by noting that while there is a need for continued research, the current approach of relying on the linear no-threshold model remains the standard for estimating cancer risks from radiation exposure. However, the lack of a collaborative mechanism among federal agencies to address research priorities in this area is highlighted as a potential area for improvement. The GAO recommends that the Department of Energy (DOE) lead the development of a mechanism for interagency collaboration to address these priorities, although DOE has not agreed with this recommendation. The GAO believes that such a mechanism could help reduce uncertainty in predicting cancer risks from low-dose radiation and improve the overall management of radiation exposure. The passage emphasizes the importance of continued research and collaboration among federal agencies to address the uncertainties surrounding low", "answers": ["This testimony summarizes the information contained in GAO's September 2017 report, entitled Low-Dose Radiation: Interagency Collaboration on Planning Research Could Improve Information on Health Effects ( GAO-17-546 ). The Department of Energy (DOE), Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Food and Drug Administration generally used the advice of scientific advisory bodies to develop and apply radiation protection requirements and guidance for workers and the public in the radiation exposure settings that GAO reviewed. These settings were: (1) the operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants; (2) the cleanup of sites with radiological contamination; (3) the use of medical equipment that produces radiation; and (4) accidental or terrorism-related exposure to radiation. Specifically, the agencies relied on the advice of three scientific advisory bodies that supported the use of a model that assumes the risk of cancer increases with every incremental radiation exposure. Accordingly, the agencies have set regulatory dose limits and issued guidance to confine exposure to levels that reduce the risk of cancer, while recognizing that scientific uncertainties occur in estimating cancer risks from low-dose radiation. For example, NRC requires nuclear power plants to consider measures for limiting workers' exposure below NRC's regulatory dose limit, such as by using robots for maintenance work in radiation areas. GAO identified seven federal agencies that funded research on low-dose radiation's health effects. In fiscal years 2012 to 2016, DOE, NRC, EPA, and four other federal agencies obligated about $210 million for such research . Although the agencies have collaborated on individual projects on radiation's health effects, they have not established a collaborative mechanism to set research priorities. GAO's previous work has shown that federal agencies can use such mechanisms to implement interagency collaboration to develop and coordinate sound science policies. In the past, DOE took a leading role in this area because DOE provided stable funding and advocated for greater coordination on research on low-dose radiation's health effects. However, since fiscal year 2012, DOE has phased out funding for one of its main research programs in this area. This has created a void in coordination efforts among federal agencies, and no other agency has stepped forward to fill this void. Because of DOE's prior experience as a leader in this area of research and its research responsibility under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, it could play an important role in helping federal agencies establish a coordinating mechanism for low-dose radiation research.

Suspension of the rules enables the House to bypass regular procedures for certain measures, particularly those that are widely supported and do not require extensive debate or amendments. This is achieved through a motion requiring a two-thirds vote, which is typically reserved for measures meeting a supermajority threshold.\n\n2. The procedure is governed by House Rule XV, and measures considered under suspension are not subject to floor amendments, although the motion to suspend and pass the measure can include proposed changes.\n\n3. Suspension measures are commonly referred to committees before floor consideration, but many are discharged directly to the floor without a committee report. The majority of measures considered under suspension in the 114th Congress were bills, and most were sponsored by members of the majority party.\n\n4. Debate on suspension measures is limited to 40 minutes, with time divided between floor managers from each party. The average length of debate was 13 minutes and 10 seconds, with most measures having a debate period of 10 minutes or less.\n\n5.

As the name suggests, the procedure allows the House to suspend its standing and statutory rules in order to consider broadly supported legislation in an expedited manner. More specifically, the House temporarily sets aside its rules that govern the raising and consideration of measures and assumes a new set of constraints particular to the suspension procedure. The suspension of the rules procedure has several parliamentary advantages: (1) it allows nonprivileged measures to be raised on the House floor without the need for a special rule, (2) it enables the consideration of measures that would otherwise be subject to a point of order, and (3) it streamlines floor action by limiting debate and prohibiting floor amendments. Given these features, as well as the required two-thirds supermajority vote for passage, suspension motions are generally used to process less controversial legislation. In the 114th Congress (2015-2016), measures considered under suspension made up 62% of the bills and resolutions that received floor action in the House (743 out of 1,200 measures). The majority of suspension measures were House bills (83%), followed by Senate bills (11%) and House resolutions (4%). The measures covered a variety of policy areas but most often addressed government operations, such as the designation of federal facilities or amending administrative policies. Most measures that are considered in the House under the suspension procedure are sponsored by a House or Senate majority party member. However, suspension is the most common House procedure used to consider minority-party-sponsored legislation regardless of whether the legislation originated in the House or Senate. In 2015 and 2016, minority-party members sponsored 31% of suspension measures, compared to 9% of legislation subject to different procedures, including privileged business (17 measures), unanimous consent (21 measures), and under the terms of a special rule (one Senate bill). Most suspension measures are referred to at least one House committee before their consideration on the floor. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform (now called the Committee on Oversight and Reform) was the committee of primary jurisdiction for the plurality of suspension measures considered in the 114th Congress. Additional committees—such as Energy and Commerce, Homeland Security, Natural Resources, Foreign Affairs, and Veterans' Affairs—also served as the primary committee for a large number of suspension measures. Suspension motions are debatable for up to 40 minutes. In most cases, only a fraction of that debate time is actually used. In the 114th Congress, the average amount of time spent considering a motion to suspend the rules was 13 minutes and 10 seconds. The House adopted nearly every suspension motion considered in 2015 and 2016. Approval by the House, however, did not guarantee final approval in the 114th Congress.

{"pred": " \n\nThe report examines the documentation and timeliness of reviews of providers' clinical care at five selected VA medical centers from October 2013 to March 2017. Key findings indicate that nearly half of the required reviews were undocumented, and many reviews were delayed or not conducted at all. The VA medical centers lacked proper documentation for focused professional practice evaluations (FPPEs) for cause and retrospective reviews, and did not initiate reviews promptly in some cases. The report attributes these issues to insufficient VHA policy requirements and inadequate oversight. Recommendations include documenting all reviews, establishing timeliness requirements, and strengthening oversight by networks. Additionally, the report highlights that only one of nine providers required to be reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) and state licensing boards was actually reported, and the reporting process was often delayed. The VA medical centers failed to report providers due to misinterpretations of VHA policies and a lack of network oversight. The report concludes that these failures allow substandard providers to maintain privileges at other facilities, posing risks to patient safety. Recommendations for improving reporting to the NPDB and state licensing boards include requiring network oversight of timely reporting. The VA concurred with the recommendations and plans to implement changes. The report underscores the importance of robust documentation and timely reporting to ensure patient safety and maintain high standards of care in VA medical centers. The findings suggest systemic issues within the VA healthcare system that require immediate attention and corrective measures. The report also notes several instances where providers who were not reported continued to provide care to veterans, highlighting the potential for patient harm. The report emphasizes the need for comprehensive oversight and clear policies to prevent such lapses in the future. The VA's failure to report providers to the NPDB and state licensing boards as required facilitates the movement of substandard providers to other facilities, which poses a significant risk to patient safety. The report recommends that VHA strengthen its oversight mechanisms to ensure that all providers who should be reported are indeed reported in a timely manner. The VA's concurrence and planned actions indicate a commitment to addressing these critical issues. The report's findings and recommendations aim to enhance accountability and improve patient care within the VA healthcare system. The report's detailed analysis and specific recommendations provide a roadmap for addressing the identified deficiencies and ensuring better patient outcomes. The report's emphasis on the importance of accurate and timely documentation and reporting underscores the need for a robust and transparent system to protect patient safety.

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (VAMC) officials are responsible for reviewing the clinical care delivered by their privileged providers—physicians and dentists who are approved to independently perform specific services—after concerns are raised. The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care. For example, GAO found that after one VAMC failed to report to the NPDB or SLBs a provider who resigned to avoid an adverse privileging action, a non-VA hospital in the same city took an adverse privileging action against that same provider for the same reason 2 years later."], "length": 6570}

The report also highlights the variability in the number of speakers and debate times, with most measures receiving very little debate, and the frequent use of unanimous consent to extend debate beyond the 40-minute limit. The overall success rate of suspension measures in the House is high, with 98% of House bills and resolutions considered under suspension passing the chamber. However, the Senate's approval rate for these measures is lower, with only 32% of House bills initially considered under suspension being passed by the Senate. The President's role in the process is also discussed, noting that 194 House bills were presented to the President for signature or veto, with some measures failing to become law due to Senate amendments or presidential vetoes.

The report highlights", "answers": ["Suspension of the rules is the most commonly used procedure to call up measures on the floor of the House of Representatives. As the name suggests, the procedure allows the House to suspend its standing and statutory rules in order to consider broadly supported legislation in an expedited manner. More specifically, the House temporarily sets aside its rules that govern the raising and consideration of measures and assumes a new set of constraints particular to the suspension procedure. The suspension of the rules procedure has several parliamentary advantages: (1) it allows nonprivileged measures to be raised on the House floor without the need for a special rule, (2) it enables the consideration of measures that would otherwise be subject to a point of order, and (3) it streamlines floor action by limiting debate and prohibiting floor amendments. Given these features, as well as the required two-thirds supermajority vote for passage, suspension motions are generally used to process less controversial legislation. In the 114th Congress (2015-2016), measures considered under suspension made up 62% of the bills and resolutions that received floor action in the House (743 out of 1,200 measures). The majority of suspension measures were House bills (83%), followed by Senate bills (11%) and House resolutions (4%). The measures covered a variety of policy areas but most often addressed government operations, such as the designation of federal facilities or amending administrative policies. Most measures that are considered in the House under the suspension procedure are sponsored by a House or Senate majority party member. However, suspension is the most common House procedure used to consider minority-party-sponsored legislation regardless of whether the legislation originated in the House or Senate. In 2015 and 2016, minority-party members sponsored 31% of suspension measures, compared to 9% of legislation subject to different procedures, including privileged business (17 measures), unanimous consent (21 measures), and under the terms of a special rule (one Senate bill). Most suspension measures are referred to at least one House committee before their consideration on the floor. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform (now called the Committee on Oversight and Reform) was the committee of primary jurisdiction for the plurality of suspension measures considered in the 114th Congress. Additional committees—such as Energy and Commerce, Homeland Security, Natural Resources, Foreign Affairs, and Veterans' Affairs—also served as the primary committee for a large number of suspension measures. Suspension motions are debatable for up to 40 minutes. In most cases, only a fraction of that debate time is actually used. In the 114th Congress, the average amount of time spent considering a motion to suspend the rules was 13 minutes and 10 seconds. The House adopted nearly every suspension motion considered in 2015 and 2016. Approval by the House, however, did not guarantee final approval in the 114th Congress. The Senate passed or agreed to 40% of the bills, joint resolutions, and concurrent resolutions initially considered in the House under suspension of the rules, and 276 measures were signed into law.

These medals are awarded by Congress to recognize outstanding achievements in various fields such as military service, humanitarian efforts, and cultural contributions. The process for awarding Congressional Gold Medals involves legislative action, with no permanent statutory provisions governing the creation of these medals. Instead, each award is handled on an ad hoc basis, allowing for flexibility in design and presentation. The authorizing legislation typically includes sections detailing the medal's design, presentation, and the circumstances under which duplicates may be sold. The design process involves consultation with advisory committees, ensuring that the medal reflects the intended honor and significance of the recipient. The number of Congressional Gold Medals awarded has increased significantly over recent decades, reflecting a broader scope of recognition beyond traditional military honors. Key considerations for Members of Congress when introducing such legislation include selecting appropriate recipients, deciding on design elements, and determining the number of medals to be awarded. The lack of formal rules governing the consideration of these bills in either the House or Senate highlights the flexibility of the process, though some committees have imposed informal requirements. The increasing frequency of these awards underscores the evolving nature of the Congressional Gold Medal as a means of recognizing diverse forms of achievement and contribution to society. The passage also notes that there is no statutory limit on the number of medals that can be awarded annually, although previous attempts have been made to impose such limits to maintain the prestige of the award.

Since 1776, this award, which initially was bestowed on military leaders, has also been given to such diverse individuals as Sir Winston Churchill and Bob Hope, George Washington and Robert Frost, Joe Louis and Mother Teresa of Calcutta. Congressional gold medal legislation generally has a specific format. Once a gold medal is authorized, it follows a specific process for design, minting, and awarding. This process includes consultation and recommendations by the Citizens Coinage Advisory Commission (CCAC) and the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts (CFA), pursuant to any statutory instructions, before the Secretary of the Treasury makes the final decision on a gold medal's design. Once the medal has been struck, a ceremony will often be scheduled to formally award the medal to the recipient. In recent years, the number of gold medals awarded has increased, and some have expressed interest in examining the gold medal awarding process. Should Congress want to make such changes, several individual and institutional options might be available. The individual options include decisions made by Members of Congress as to what individual or groups might be honored; potential specification of gold medal design elements; and where gold medals for groups might be housed once the award is made.

Since the 1990s, Congress has enacted restrictions on the use of funds appropriated for these agencies to promote tobacco exports. The State, Commerce, and USDA have developed and updated guidance to implement these restrictions, but not all officials are aware of them, and some find the guidance unclear. The State, Commerce, and USDA officials we interviewed said they have implemented the funding restrictions on tobacco as outlined in the interagency guidance cable issued by State. However, not all officials were aware of the restrictions, and more than half had not received training about the restrictions. The guidance does not provide sufficient clarity on the types of services officials are allowed to provide to tobacco companies and the description of tobacco products. The United States exported over $2.1 billion in tobacco and tobacco-related products in 2017, with fluctuations in exports over the past decade. The State, Commerce, and USDA have developed and updated guidance to implement funding restrictions on promoting tobacco exports overseas, but not all officials are aware of the restrictions and more than half had not received training about the restrictions. The guidance is unclear in some areas, and officials are unsure whether they can attend events where representatives from U.S. tobacco companies may be present. Clearer guidance would help ensure that officials consistently implement their agency-specific funding restrictions. The report recommends that the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Agriculture include information about the funding restrictions and relevant guidance on promoting the sale or export of tobacco or tobacco products in training materials for employees conducting export promotion activities overseas. Additionally, the Secretary of State should assess the interagency guidance cable on promoting tobacco in light of questions raised by officials at posts overseas and update it to address ambiguities, as needed. The report concludes that clearer guidance is necessary to ensure consistent implementation of funding restrictions on promoting tobacco exports. The report provides evidence through interviews with officials from State, Commerce, and USDA, as well as a review of agency documents and emails, to support its findings.

This report examines (1) guidance select U.S. agencies have issued to implement these restrictions, (2) whether overseas officials from select U.S. agencies were aware of the restrictions and guidance, and (3) select U.S. agencies' implementation of the guidance overseas. GAO reviewed U.S. laws, agency guidance, and internal communications; analyzed Commerce data; and interviewed agency officials in Washington, D.C. and in 24 offices across 11 overseas posts in 9 countries. GAO selected these countries based on criteria that included U.S. tobacco export totals, smoking rates, and geographic dispersion. Congress has restricted the use of certain appropriated funding to promote tobacco exports and the Departments of State (State), Commerce (Commerce), and Agriculture (USDA) have issued interagency guidance through the cable system that they rely on to implement these restrictions. State collaborates with these and other agencies to periodically update this cable. The cable informs officials about the types of actions they should take—such as providing routine business facilitation services to all U.S. companies—and the types of actions they should not take—such as attending events sponsored by tobacco companies. Most, but not all, officials overseas that GAO interviewed were aware of the restrictions and received some guidance concerning the restrictions. However, GAO found that some officials did not recall receiving the interagency guidance cable. In addition, State and USDA's current training materials do not address the restrictions. Federal internal control standards state that appropriate training is essential to an organization's operational success. Thus, providing officials overseas with training about the funding restrictions and related guidance would help to ensure that officials are aware of the restrictions. U.S. officials overseas have implemented restrictions on promoting tobacco, but some officials said that the interagency guidance lacks clarity. Officials said that they have not promoted tobacco by, for example, attending events sponsored solely by tobacco companies. However, officials identified three areas of the guidance that are unclear: (1) attendance at events not sponsored by U.S. tobacco companies but attended by representatives of these companies; (2) the types of services officials can provide tobacco companies; and (3) the description of tobacco products, such as whether component parts for electronic cigarettes are included. Federal standards for internal control state that management should clearly document internal controls in policies and guidance to prevent officials from failing to achieve an objective or address a risk. By providing more specific guidance, the agencies would help ensure that officials consistently implement the funding restrictions on promoting tobacco.

These agencies have varying authorities to acquire and dispose of federal lands. The NPS lacks general authority to acquire new lands, while the BLM has broad authority to acquire and dispose of lands. The FWS can acquire lands but cannot dispose of them without Congressional approval, except through exchanges or if lands are no longer needed. The USFS has limited acquisition and disposal authorities, mainly for lands within or contiguous to national forests. Congress often debates the adequacy and use of these authorities, and various bills propose modifications or eliminations. Funding for land acquisition comes primarily from the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), with additional sources like the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund (MBCF) for specific agencies. The BLM has broad land disposal authorities, including exchanges, sales, and transfers, while the NPS, FWS, and USFS have more limited disposal authorities. Key evidence includes the varying acquisition and disposal authorities granted by Congress and the specific laws governing each agency's actions. Unique points include the importance of the MBCF for FWS land acquisitions and the broad land disposal authorities of the BLM. Congress frequently considers legislation to address the extent of federal land ownership and funding mechanisms for land acquisition. The BLM's Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act provides a significant revenue stream for land acquisition and development in Nevada. The General Mining Law of 1872, though still in effect, has been largely suspended due to annual moratoria since FY1995. The FWS's Migratory Bird Conservation Act and the USFS's various acquisition authorities are notable for their predictability and permanence in funding. The NPS's inability to dispose of lands without Congressional approval highlights the strict preservation focus of the agency. The BLM's ability to use eminent domain for land acquisition and its broad land disposal authorities underscore the agency's role in balancing resource management and public access. The varying authorities and funding mechanisms reflect the complex interplay between federal land management and public policy.

Four agencies—the National Park Service (NPS), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in the Department of the Interior, and the U.S. Forest Service (FS) in the Department of Agriculture—administer about 95% of those lands. The extent to which each of these four federal agencies have authority to acquire and dispose of land varies considerably. The BLM has relatively broad authority for both acquisitions and disposals under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA). The agency also has other authorities for disposing of land, including two laws that allow the agency to retain the proceeds for subsequent land acquisition, among other purposes, and a law that allows transfers to governmental units and other entities for public purposes. By contrast, the NPS has no general authority to acquire land to create new park units or to dispose of park lands. The FS authority to acquire lands is mostly limited to lands within or contiguous to the boundaries of a national forest. The agency has various authorities to dispose of land, but they are relatively constrained and infrequently used. The FWS has various authorities to acquire lands but no general authority to dispose of its lands. The agency frequently uses acquisition authority under the Migratory Bird Conservation Act of 1929 because of the availability of funding through the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund. The nature of the acquisition and disposal authorities of the four federal agencies also varies. In general, the acquisition authorities are designed to allow the four agencies to bring into federal ownership lands that many contend could benefit from federal management. Disposal authorities generally are designed to allow agencies to convey land that is no longer needed for a federal purpose or that might be chiefly valuable for another purpose. Some of the authorities specify particular circumstances where they can be used, such as the conveyance of FS land for educational purposes and the disposal of BLM land for recreation and public purposes. Congress often faces questions on the adequacy of existing acquisition and disposal authorities; the nature, extent, and location of their use; and the extent of federal land ownership overall. The current acquisition and disposal authorities form the backdrop for consideration of measures to establish, modify, or eliminate authorities, or to provide for the acquisition or disposal of particular lands. In some cases, Congress enacts bills to provide authority to acquire or dispose of particular parcels where no standing authority exists and, in other cases, to direct or facilitate land transactions. Congress also addresses acquisition and disposal policy in the context of debates on the role and goals of the federal government in owning and managing land generally, and it has considered broader measures to dispose of lands or to promote acquisition. Other issues for Congress pertain to the sources and levels of funds for land acquisition. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) is the primary source of funding for land acquisition. Congress has considered diverse measures related to the LWCF, such as legislation to make LWCF funding permanent and bills to direct LWCF monies to additional, nonacquisition purposes. Additionally, the FWS has the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund, an account with mandatory spending authority supported by revenue from three sources.

The conflicts 2001 to the present have greatly increased the number of Purple Hearts awarded to servicemembers. Events over the past few years have spurred debate on the eligibility criteria for the Purple Heart. Shootings on U.S. soil and medical conditions such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have prompted changes to the eligibility requirements for the Purple Heart. Some critics believe that these changes may lessen the value of the medal and the sacrifices of past recipients on the battlefield. In the past, efforts to modify the Purple Heart's eligibility requirements were contentious, and veterans groups were vocal concerning eligibility changes. While medal requirements are often left to the military and executive branch to decide, Congress is involved in Purple Heart eligibility, utilizing its constitutional power \"To Make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces\" (U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 8, clause 14). The Carl Levin and Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 (P.L. 113-291) included language that expands eligibility for the Purple Heart. Previous debates have raised several questions about the Purple Heart. In some respects, how an event is defined can determine eligibility: Is a servicemember the victim of a crime or a terrorist attack? Conversely, arguing that killed or wounded servicemembers \"should\" be eligible for the Purple Heart can redefine an event: Is the servicemember an advisor to a foreign military or a combatant? Are PTSD and other mental health conditions adequate injuries to warrant the Purple Heart? These are questions that Congress might consider if it chooses to act on this issue."], "length": 6659}

During FY2017, the RRB paid nearly $12.5 billion in retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to approximately 548,000 beneficiaries and paid $105.4 million in unemployment and sickness benefits to approximately 28,000 claimants. Of the total $12.5 billion benefit payments in the same fiscal year, 60.0% was paid to retired workers, 8.0% to disabled workers, 14.4% to spouses, and 16.8% to survivors. The Railroad Retirement Act (RRA) authorizes retirement, disability, and survivor benefits for railroad workers and their families. RRA is financed primarily by payroll taxes, financial interchanges from Social Security, and transfers from the National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust (NRRIT). Railroad retirement payroll taxes have two tiers: the Tier I tax is essentially the same as the Social Security payroll tax and the Tier II tax is set each year based on the railroad retirement system's asset balances, benefit payments, and administrative costs. In FY2017, the gross RRA funding was about $12.7 billion. Railroad retirement annuities are also divided into two tiers. Tier I annuities are designed to be nearly equivalent to Social Security benefits and are based on both railroad retirement and Social Security-covered employment. However, Tier I annuities are more generous than Social Security benefits in certain situations. For example, at the age of 60, railroad workers with at least 30 years of covered railroad work may receive unreduced retirement annuities. Tier II annuities are similar to private pensions and based solely on covered railroad service. Tier II annuities are paid in addition to Tier I annuities. Railroad disability annuities may be payable to totally disabled railroad workers who are permanently disabled from all work and occupational disabled workers who are found to be permanently disabled from their regular railroad occupations. Eligible spouses and survivors of railroad workers may receive a certain portion of Tier I and Tier II benefits, but divorced spouses and surviving divorced spouses are eligible for only a certain portion of Tier I benefits. The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act (RUIA) authorizes unemployment and sickness benefits for railroad workers. RUIA is financed solely by railroad employers, whose contributions are based on the taxable earnings of their employees. Eligibility for railroad unemployment and sickness benefits is based on recent railroad service and earnings. The maximum daily unemployment and sickness benefit payable in the benefit year that began July 1, 2018, is $77, and the maximum benefit for a biweekly claim is $770.

{"pred": " \n\nPassage 1 discusses the Fire Management Assistance Grant (FMAG) system under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. The FMAG system provides federal assistance for fire suppression activities on public or private forest land or grassland. The system was established in 2001 and is managed by FEMA's Regional Administrators. States and tribes can request FMAGs when a fire is out of control and threatens to become a major disaster. The request must include cost estimates and details about the fire. FEMA evaluates the request based on criteria such as the threat to lives and property, the availability of state and local resources, and fire danger conditions. The FMAG process involves a cost-sharing component, where state, local, and tribal governments are responsible for 25% of the expenses. The FMAGs are funded through FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund, which is a no-year account. The decision to issue an FMAG declaration is not contingent on the DRF balance, and FMAGs do not reduce the amount of funding available for major disasters. The report also explains that FMAGs are similar to other FEMA assistance in that they do not replicate or displace the work of other federal agencies, nor do they pay straight-time salaries for public safety forces. Instead, they reimburse for eligible activities such as equipment, personnel, and grants. The report concludes by noting that FMAGs are primarily used to assist states in fighting fires on nonfederal lands, while suppression operations on federal lands are the responsibility of the federal agency with jurisdiction. The passage highlights the importance of the cost-sharing component and the role of FEMA in evaluating and approving FMAG requests. It also emphasizes the unique aspects of the FMAG system, such as its eligibility criteria and the fact that it can be requested by tribes, unlike other federal assistance programs. The passage also notes that the FMAG process can be used in conjunction with other federal assistance programs, such as the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, to provide comprehensive support for wildfire management. The report also mentions that the FMAG system is flexible, allowing states to reserve unused funds for unexpected occurrences, such as natural disasters. The passage concludes by explaining that the FMAG system is designed to provide timely and effective assistance to states and tribes in managing wildfires, while ensuring that the federal government does not bear the full cost of these efforts.

{"pred": " \n\nThe U.S. Postal Service (USPS) has seen significant growth in its competitive products, with revenue increasing from 10% to 28% of total mail revenues between fiscal years 2008 and 2017. This growth is largely driven by e-commerce, particularly in \"last-mile\" delivery services. USPS aims to maintain its competitive edge by leveraging scanning technologies to provide real-time tracking and accurate delivery estimates. Despite these efforts, USPS faces challenges in ensuring accurate scanning of competitive products, with instances of missed or inaccurate scans occurring. The USPS OIG reports found that in 2017, 1.9 million delivery scans were improperly recorded, and in one district, about 0.73% of competitive products lacked a delivery scan. USPS has taken steps to address these issues, such as updating scanning devices to alert carriers when they scan items as delivered at incorrect addresses. However, inconsistencies in standard operating procedures and lack of clear communication to employees pose ongoing challenges. To improve scanning accuracy, USPS should consider adopting a set of internal control standards, updating its procedures, and creating guidelines for managers to address scanning issues effectively. While USPS initially disagreed with the recommendation to adopt internal control standards, it now plans to conduct a cost-benefit analysis to determine the feasibility of implementing such standards. Key evidence includes the growth in competitive product revenue, the role of e-commerce, and the findings from USPS OIG reports on scanning issues.

The inclusion of specific data and references", "answers": ["USPS's competitive products have become increasingly important, comprising about 28 percent of USPS's total revenue. USPS scans these packages at various points throughout the postal network. When scans are inaccurate or missing, questions are raised about the veracity of USPS's data on scanning performance and can lead to customer complaints. GAO was asked to review USPS's scanning policies and procedures. In this report, GAO (1) describes USPS's scanning performance and (2) examines how USPS ensures accurate scanning. GAO reviewed USPS's policies and procedures and assessed them against internal control standards; interviewed officials from USPS and five high-volume mailers; and conducted site visits to six post offices in two USPS districts that represented a range of volume, number of routes, and performance. Mail products over which the United States Postal Service (USPS) does not exercise market dominance, such as many of its packages, are called competitive products. These items are scanned throughout the mail delivery system to track their progress (see figure). USPS data show that these products are almost always scanned. For example, USPS data showed that for the first three quarters of fiscal year 2018; all but one of USPS's 67 districts met their scanning goals. Additionally, mailers that account for a high volume of USPS's competitive products told GAO that they believed USPS was generally scanning products correctly. However, a small percentage of missed or inaccurate scans occur. For example, a report from one USPS district showed that for one week, 0.73 percent of the products delivered were missing a scan and that for the fiscal year to date almost 155,000 competitive products were missing a delivery scan. USPS has designed and implemented procedures and activities to help ensure accurate scanning, but some limitations could contribute to scanning errors. For example, USPS has not based its operational procedures for scanning on any internal control standards. USPS officials said the procedures were based on USPS's unique responsibilities, management experience, and sound business practices, but the officials could not identify specific standards or a framework that they followed as the basis for the procedures. USPS officials said they did not believe any internal controls standards applied to these procedures. By not basing procedures on standards, USPS may miss opportunities to improve how it achieves its mission to scan and measure the performance of competitive products. Additionally, USPS's scanning procedure documents, such as for outlining specific delivery scanning steps, are not always consistent, and USPS relies on more informal methods, such as meetings with employees to communicate changes. Thus, employees may not have accurate procedures available to them. Finally, USPS lacks procedures to help managers identify and address incorrect scans, address customer complaints or otherwise address scanning irregularities. For example, USPS's guidance for managers is limited to a list of bullet-points that do not detail the steps managers should follow to resolve scanning irregularities. In addition, this list has not been updated since 2005. Without consistent or detailed procedures, USPS's employees and managers may not scan items accurately or find information needed to resolve scanning issues—a situation that could hinder USPS's ability to reduce inaccurate or missing scans for these important mail products. GAO recommends that USPS: (1) identify and adopt internal control standards for its operational activities such as for scanning of competitive products; (2) improve the communication of procedures for scanning competitive products; and, (3) create procedures for supervisors on how to address inaccurate scans and resolve scanning issues. USPS agreed to explore addressing the first recommendation and agreed with the other two recommendations."], "length": 6605}

The current missions include a counterterrorism mission led by the US and a NATO-led Resolute Support mission aimed at establishing self-sustaining Afghan security forces. Despite improvements, the ANDSF (Afghan National Defense and Security Forces) still faces significant capability gaps, particularly in conventional forces, which make up about 75% of the ANDSF. The ANDSF's ability to operate and maintain U.S.-purchased equipment is limited, especially for conventional forces, due to a lack of embedded advisors at the tactical level. The ANDSF has improved in some areas like operational planning and coordination, but still relies heavily on coalition support. Key equipment includes MD-530 helicopters, Mobile Strike Force Vehicles (MSFVs), and radios. The ANDSF's capability gaps and reliance on coalition support highlight the ongoing challenges in developing a self-sustaining ANDSF. The Department of Defense (DOD) should develop and implement methods to collect reliable information on the ANDSF's ability to operate and maintain U.S.-purchased equipment, as this is crucial for evaluating the success of training and support efforts. The report recommends that DOD consider alternative approaches, such as the National Maintenance Strategy Ground Vehicle Support contract and the deployment of the Security Force Assistance Brigade, to gather more reliable information on the conventional forces' operational and maintenance abilities. The ANDSF's progress and challenges are illustrated through detailed analyses of specific equipment types, such as MD-530 helicopters, MSFVs, and radios, highlighting the gaps in their operational and maintenance capabilities.

House Report 114-537 included a provision for GAO to review the ANDSF's capability and capacity to operate and sustain U.S.-purchased weapon systems and equipment. This report addresses (1) what has been reported about ANDSF capabilities and capability gaps and (2) the extent to which DOD has information about the ANDSF's ability to operate and maintain U.S.-purchased equipment. To conduct this work, GAO analyzed DOD and NATO reports and documents, examined three critical equipment types, and interviewed DOD officials in the United States and Afghanistan. This is a public version of a sensitive report issued in September 2018. Information that DOD deemed sensitive has been omitted. Since the Resolute Support mission began in 2015, the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) have improved some fundamental capabilities, such as high-level operational planning, but continue to rely on U.S. and coalition support to fill several key capability gaps, according to Department of Defense (DOD) reporting. DOD has initiatives to address some ANDSF capability gaps, such as a country-wide vehicle maintenance and training effort, but DOD reports it does not expect the ANDSF to develop and sustain independent capabilities in some areas, such as logistics, for several years. While DOD has firsthand information on the abilities of the Afghan Air Force and Special Security Forces to operate and maintain U.S.-purchased equipment, it has little reliable information on the equipment proficiency of conventional ANDSF units. U.S. and coalition advisors are embedded at the tactical level for the Air Force and Special Security Forces, enabling DOD to directly assess those forces' abilities. However, the advisors have little direct contact with conventional ANDSF units on the front lines. As a result, DOD relies on those units' self-assessments of tactical abilities, which, according to DOD officials, can be unreliable. GAO's analysis of three critical equipment types illustrated the varying degrees of DOD's information (see figure above). For example, DOD provided detailed information about the Air Force's ability to operate and maintain MD-530 helicopters and the Special Security Forces' ability to operate and maintain Mobile Strike Force Vehicles; however, DOD had limited information about how conventional forces operate and maintain radios and Mobile Strike Force Vehicles. DOD's lack of reliable information on conventional forces' equipment operations and maintenance abilities adds to the uncertainty and risk in assessing the progress of DOD efforts in Afghanistan.

GAO was asked to review USPS's scanning policies and procedures. In this report, GAO (1) describes USPS's scanning performance and (2) examines how USPS ensures accurate scanning. GAO reviewed USPS's policies and procedures and assessed them against internal control standards; interviewed officials from USPS and five high-volume mailers; and conducted site visits to six post offices in two USPS districts that represented a range of volume, number of routes, and performance. Mail products over which the United States Postal Service (USPS) does not exercise market dominance, such as many of its packages, are called competitive products. These items are scanned throughout the mail delivery system to track their progress (see figure). USPS data show that these products are almost always scanned. For example, USPS data showed that for the first three quarters of fiscal year 2018; all but one of USPS's 67 districts met their scanning goals. Additionally, mailers that account for a high volume of USPS's competitive products told GAO that they believed USPS was generally scanning products correctly. However, a small percentage of missed or inaccurate scans occur. For example, a report from one USPS district showed that for one week, 0.73 percent of the products delivered were missing a scan and that for the fiscal year to date almost 155,000 competitive products were missing a delivery scan. USPS has designed and implemented procedures and activities to help ensure accurate scanning, but some limitations could contribute to scanning errors. For example, USPS has not based its operational procedures for scanning on any internal control standards. USPS officials said the procedures were based on USPS's unique responsibilities, management experience, and sound business practices, but the officials could not identify specific standards or a framework that they followed as the basis for the procedures. USPS officials said they did not believe any internal controls standards applied to these procedures. By not basing procedures on standards, USPS may miss opportunities to improve how it achieves its mission to scan and measure the performance of competitive products. Additionally, USPS's scanning procedure documents, such as for outlining specific delivery scanning steps, are not always consistent, and USPS relies on more informal methods, such as meetings with employees to communicate changes. Thus, employees may not have accurate procedures available to them. Finally, USPS lacks procedures to help managers identify and address incorrect scans, address customer complaints or otherwise address scanning irregularities. For example, USPS's guidance for managers is limited to a list of bullet-points that do not detail the steps managers should follow to resolve scanning irregularities. In addition, this list has not been updated since 2005. Without consistent or detailed procedures, USPS's employees and managers may not scan items accurately or find information needed to resolve scanning issues—a situation that could hinder USPS's ability to reduce inaccurate or missing scans for these important mail products. GAO recommends that USPS: (1) identify and adopt internal control standards for its operational activities such as for scanning of competitive products; (2) improve the communication of procedures for scanning competitive products; and, (3) create procedures for supervisors on how to address inaccurate scans and resolve scanning issues. USPS agreed to explore addressing the first recommendation and agreed with the other two recommendations."], "length": 6605}

Since 1978, NCA has provided funding through the Veterans Cemetery Grants Program to assist state and tribal governments in establishing, expanding, or improving veterans' cemeteries. NCA's goal is to provide reasonable access to burial options for 95% of veterans, with plans to establish 18 new national cemeteries, including five traditional and 13 urban and rural initiative sites. Challenges in land acquisition, cost estimation, and data utilization have delayed the opening of some planned cemeteries. NCA's cost-estimating guidance for cemetery construction projects does not fully incorporate best practices, leading to unreliable cost estimates. Using census tract data to estimate served and unserved veteran populations could enhance NCA's decision-making. As of September 2019, only six out of 18 planned sites were open, with NCA years behind its original schedule. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs should ensure NCA updates its cost-estimating procedures to fully incorporate best practices. The progress in increasing burial access for veterans has been limited, but the opening of six sites has improved accessibility. NCA's methodology uses county-level data, which may not accurately reflect the true number of unserved veterans. The use of census tract data could provide a more precise estimate and help NCA better target areas with significant unserved veteran populations. The report recommends that NCA revise its cost-estimating guidance to include risk and uncertainty analysis, and VA should implement this recommendation. The progress in establishing new cemeteries has been slower than anticipated, highlighting the need for improved planning and execution. The report concludes that NCA's current approach to land acquisition and cost estimation poses risks to achieving its strategic goals. The use of census tract data could improve the accuracy of veteran population estimates and enhance NCA's decision-making processes. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs should take action to address these issues. The report emphasizes the importance of reliable cost estimates and the need for NCA to better utilize census tract data to inform its plans for providing reasonable access to burial options for veterans.

In fiscal year 2018 VA estimated that about 92 percent of veterans had reasonable access to burial options, which was an increase from 90 percent in fiscal year 2014 but short of its goal of 96 percent by the end of fiscal year 2017. The House Appropriations Committee has expressed concerns that there are geographic pockets where veterans remain unserved by burial options. House Report 115-188 accompanying a bill for the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018, includes a provision for GAO to examine veterans' access to burial options. This report (1) describes VA's plan for increasing reasonable access to burial options for veterans and (2) assesses VA's progress in implementing its plan and any challenges experienced. GAO reviewed applicable VA and NCA documents, compared NCA's cost-estimating practices with GAO's cost-estimating 12 steps, and met with cognizant officials regarding NCA's efforts to provide reasonable access to burial options. Within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) has a plan to establish 18 new national cemeteries to increase reasonable access to burial options for veterans. NCA defines reasonable access as a national or state veterans' cemetery being located within 75 miles of veterans' homes. Key parts of NCA's plan include establishing 13 urban and rural initiative national cemeteries and awarding grant funds to state applicants for establishing new state veterans' cemeteries. NCA has made limited progress in implementing its plan to increase burial access and is years behind its original schedule for opening new cemeteries. For example, NCA has opened only two of its planned urban and rural initiative sites and is behind its original schedule for the other 11 (see fig. below). The primary factor delaying NCA's completion of these cemeteries has been challenges in acquiring suitable land. NCA has also been challenged in producing accurate estimates of construction costs for most of its rural initiative sites. Cost estimates have increased more than 200 percent (from about $7 million to $24 million) for these sites, and NCA's guidance for developing cost estimates for the cemeteries does not fully incorporate the 12 steps identified in cost-estimating leading practices—such as conducting a risk and uncertainty analysis or a sensitivity analysis. As a result, NCA is not well positioned to provide reliable and valid cost estimates to better inform decisions to enhance veterans' cemetery access.

The ACV is designed to enhance the Marines' amphibious and land operations capabilities, including self-deployment from amphibious shipping, traversing rough seas, and operating in various terrains. The ACV Increment 1.1, which entered the acquisition cycle in 2016, is an eight-wheeled vehicle capable of carrying 10 Marines and a crew of 3, with a focus on affordability and survivability. After a competitive process, BAE Systems was selected to produce the ACV 1.1 in 2018, with the first 30 vehicles to be delivered by 2019. The ACV 1.2, a tracked version, is being developed to improve amphibious capabilities, including higher water speeds and self-deployment from ships. The consolidation of ACV 1.1 and ACV 1.2 into a single program is expected to streamline production and potentially reduce costs. However, the adoption of Expeditionary Advance Base Operations (EABO) as an operational concept may necessitate further modifications to the ACV program, impacting its acquisition timeline and cost. The Marine Corps' acquisition priorities and budget constraints have influenced the development and implementation of the ACV program, highlighting the importance of balancing technological advancements with fiscal considerations. The ACV program faces challenges in meeting the legal requirement for amphibious and land operations, as well as addressing the evolving threat landscape and the need for a robust amphibious assault capability in the context of potential peer adversaries. The program's progress and future direction are closely monitored by Congress, which may scrutinize the ACV's role in national security and its cost-effectiveness. The ACV program's success hinges on overcoming technical hurdles, ensuring affordability, and adapting to emerging operational concepts like EABO. The consolidation of ACV variants and the potential impact of EABO on the program underscore the complexity of balancing technological innovation with fiscal responsibility in the context of evolving military strategies and threats. The Marine Corps' acquisition of the ACV reflects a strategic effort to modernize its amphibious assault capabilities, addressing both current operational needs and future challenges posed by advanced anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD) threats. The program's progress and future direction are subject to ongoing scrutiny by Congress, which may", "answers": ["On January 6, 2011, after spending approximately $3 billion in developmental funding, the Marine Corps cancelled the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV) program due to poor reliability demonstrated during operational testing and excessive cost growth. Because the EFV was intended to replace the 40-year-old Amphibious Assault Vehicle (AAV), the Pentagon pledged to move quickly to develop a \"more affordable and sustainable\" vehicle to replace the EFV. The Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV) is intended to replace the AAV, incorporating some EFV capabilities but in a more practical and cost-efficient manner. In concert with the ACV, the Marines were developing the Marine Personnel Carrier (MPC) to serve as a survivable and mobile platform to transport Marines when ashore. The MPC was not intended to be amphibious like an AAV, EFV, or the ACV but instead would be required to have a swim capability for inland waterways such as rivers, lakes, and other water obstacles such as shore-to-shore operations in the littorals. Both vehicles were intended to play central roles in future Marine amphibious operations. On June 14, 2013, Marine leadership put the MPC program \"on ice\" due to budgetary pressures but suggested the program might be resurrected some 10 years down the road when budgetary resources might be more favorable. In what was described as a \"drastic shift,\" the Marines decided to \"resurrect\" the MPC in March 2014. The Marines designated the MPC as ACV Increment 1.1 and planned to acquire about 200 vehicles. The Marines also plan to develop ACV Increment 1.2, a tracked, fully amphibious version, and at the time planned to acquire about 470 vehicles and fund an ongoing high water speed study. Although ACV Increment 1.1 is to have a swim capability, another mode of transport (ship or aircraft) would be required to get the vehicles from ship to shore. The Marines are reportedly exploring the possibility of developing a high water speed ACV 2.0, which could accompany tanks and light armored vehicles into combat. On November 5, 2014, the Marines released a draft Request for Proposal (RFP) for ACV Increment 1.1. On November 24, 2015, the Marine Corps awarded BAE Systems and SAIC contracts to develop ACV 1.1 prototypes for evaluation. BAE's contract was for $103.8 million and SAIC's for $121.5 million, and each company was to build 16 prototypes to be tested over the next two years. Both BAE and SAIC delivered their prototypes early, and Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) testing began mid-March 2017. In early December 2017, the Marines reportedly sent the ACV 1.1 down select request for proposals to BAE and Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC). On June 19, 2018, the Marine Corps selected BAE Systems to produce the ACV. The initial contract—valued at $198 million—was for low-rate production of 30 vehicles to be delivered by the autumn of 2019. On April 10, 2019, during testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee, Navy and Marine Corps leadership announced that during the fall of 2018, ACV 1.1 prototypes demonstrated satisfactory water mobility performance in high surf conditions and, in doing so, met the full water mobility transition requirement for ACV 1.2 capability. As a result, ACV 1.1 and ACV 1.2 were to be consolidated into a single variant—the ACV—which is intended to replace all AAVs.

This report examines (1) vacancies in State's Foreign Service staffing at overseas posts, (2) reported effects of Foreign Service vacancies on diplomatic readiness, and (3) State's efforts to address Foreign Service vacancies. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed State's Global Employment Management System data as of March 2018. The system includes information on Foreign Service and Civil Service positions, including the total number of authorized Foreign Service positions and whether each position is filled or vacant. GAO also reviewed its relevant prior reports and State workforce planning documents. In addition, GAO interviewed State staff at 10 overseas posts, selected on the basis of large numbers of Foreign Service vacancies and diversity in the types of Foreign Service positions that were vacant at these posts, among other factors. The Department of State's (State) data show persistent Foreign Service vacancies at overseas posts since 2008. According to the data, 13 percent of overseas Foreign Service positions were vacant as of March 2018. This percentage is similar to the percentages GAO reported for 2008 and 2012, when 14 percent of these positions were vacant. In addition, State's data show persistent vacancies at overseas posts in generalist positions that help formulate and implement U.S. foreign policy and in specialist positions that support and maintain the functioning of overseas posts. State's data also show persistent Foreign Service vacancies at overseas posts with State's highest foreign policy priorities and in regions with security risks that could threaten U.S. foreign policy interests. According to staff at overseas posts, Foreign Service vacancies adversely affect State's ability to carry out U.S. foreign policy. Staff at overseas posts told us that vacancies increase workloads, contributing to low morale and higher stress for Foreign Service staff and that vacancies in Political and Economic positions—20 percent and 16 percent, respectively—limit the reporting on political and economic issues that posts are able to provide to State headquarters. Notably, officials also stated that vacancies in specialist positions may heighten security risks at overseas posts and disrupt post operations. For instance, some overseas post staff said that vacancies in Information Management positions had increased the vulnerability of posts' computer networks to potential cybersecurity attacks and other malicious threats. State described various efforts—implemented by multiple offices in the department —to help address overseas Foreign Service vacancies, but these efforts are not guided by an integrated action plan to reduce persistent vacancies.

GAO also analyzed a nongeneralizable sample of 12 of the 60 assistance agreements that were awarded by State, USAID, HHS, and USDA to OAS, PAHO, and IICA and were active during calendar years 2014 through 2016. For each agency, GAO selected three agreements with the lowest, median, and highest dollar value. GAO found that strategic goals of the Organization of American States (OAS), the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA), and the Pan-American Institute of Geography and History (PAIGH) are predominantly aligned with the strategic goals of the Department of State (State), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). For example, IICA's strategic goals of a productive agricultural sector, enhancing agricultural development, and food security are aligned with USDA's foreign assistance goals. State, USAID, HHS, and USDA fund activities in the form of assistance agreements (e.g., grants and cooperative agreements) with OAS, PAHO, and IICA, which in 2016 totaled $32 million. According to agency officials, the agencies employ mechanisms to ensure that these agreements align with U.S. strategic goals. OAS, PAHO, IICA, and PAIGH have established mechanisms for overseeing their use of funds, such as external auditors, internal audit boards, and anti-fraud and ethics policies. State and USDA have directly supported these mechanisms. For example, State engaged in the selection process for OAS's Inspector General. GAO's review of 12 selected assistance agreements found that USDA included no financial or performance monitoring provisions in one of its agreements and that State did not include two key monitoring provisions in one of its agreements, called for by applicable guidance. GAO found that the remaining 10 agreements it reviewed contained all key monitoring provisions and that State has since taken corrective action. GAO found that U.S. agencies did not have full documentation of 18 of the 42 monitoring activities required by the 12 assistance agreements GAO reviewed (see table). For example, USDA did not have full documentation, such as for financial reports, of any of its 10 required monitoring activities and USDA officials did not explain their lack of documentation. USAID officials explained that their lack of full documentation was due, in part, to grant officers not always following their document management policies.

In 2009 and 2012, GAO identified ongoing Foreign Service staffing gaps. GAO was asked to review State's Foreign Service staffing. This report examines (1) vacancies in State's Foreign Service staffing at overseas posts, (2) reported effects of Foreign Service vacancies on diplomatic readiness, and (3) State's efforts to address Foreign Service vacancies. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed State's Global Employment Management System data as of March 2018. The system includes information on Foreign Service and Civil Service positions, including the total number of authorized Foreign Service positions and whether each position is filled or vacant. GAO also reviewed its relevant prior reports and State workforce planning documents. In addition, GAO interviewed State staff at 10 overseas posts, selected on the basis of large numbers of Foreign Service vacancies and diversity in the types of Foreign Service positions that were vacant at these posts, among other factors. The Department of State's (State) data show persistent Foreign Service vacancies at overseas posts since 2008. According to the data, 13 percent of overseas Foreign Service positions were vacant as of March 2018. This percentage is similar to the percentages GAO reported for 2008 and 2012, when 14 percent of these positions were vacant. In addition, State's data show persistent vacancies at overseas posts in generalist positions that help formulate and implement U.S. foreign policy and in specialist positions that support and maintain the functioning of overseas posts. State's data also show persistent Foreign Service vacancies at overseas posts with State's highest foreign policy priorities and in regions with security risks that could threaten U.S. foreign policy interests. According to staff at overseas posts, Foreign Service vacancies adversely affect State's ability to carry out U.S. foreign policy. Staff at overseas posts told us that vacancies increase workloads, contributing to low morale and higher stress for Foreign Service staff and that vacancies in Political and Economic positions—20 percent and 16 percent, respectively—limit the reporting on political and economic issues that posts are able to provide to State headquarters. Notably, officials also stated that vacancies in specialist positions may heighten security risks at overseas posts and disrupt post operations. For instance, some overseas post staff said that vacancies in Information Management positions had increased the vulnerability of posts' computer networks to potential cybersecurity attacks and other malicious threats. State described various efforts—implemented by multiple offices in the department —to help address overseas Foreign Service vacancies, but these efforts are not guided by an integrated action plan to reduce persistent vacancies. An example of State's efforts is the “Hard-to-Fill” program, which allows Civil Service staff an opportunity to fill a Foreign Service vacancy on a single overseas tour. According to GAO's 2017 High-Risk Series report, an agency should design and implement an action plan—integrated across its relevant offices—that defines the root causes of all skills gaps and suggests corrective measures. However, State has not developed such an action plan for reducing persistent overseas Foreign Service vacancies. Without developing an integrated action plan, overseas Foreign Service vacancies may persist. As a result, State's ability to achieve U.S. foreign policy goals and help ensure secure and efficient operations could be adversely impacted. GAO recommends that State develop an integrated action plan that defines the root causes of persistent Foreign Service vacancies at overseas posts and suggests corrective measures to reduce such vacancies.

The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care.

This initiative has been funded using OCO appropriations, which Congress provides in addition to DOD's base budget appropriations. The Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying the Continuing Appropriations and Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017, included a provision for GAO to review matters related to ERI. In this report, we (1) describe changes in ERI's objectives, funding under ERI, and DOD's posture in Europe since 2014 and (2) evaluate the extent to which DOD's planning processes for posture initiatives funded under ERI prioritize those initiatives, estimate their long-term costs, and communicate their estimated costs to Congress. GAO analyzed DOD strategy documentation, budget and cost analysis guidance, budget justification materials, and cost and obligations data. GAO also interviewed knowledgeable officials within the Office of the Secretary of Defense, U.S. European Command, the military services, and the State Department. Since 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) has expanded the European Reassurance Initiative's (ERI) objectives, increased its funding, and planned enhancements to European posture. DOD expanded ERI's objectives from the short-term reassurance of allies and partners to include deterring Russian aggression in the long term and developing the capacity to field a credible combined force should deterrence fail. With respect to funding, DOD will have requested approximately $4.5 billion for ERI's posture enhancements through the end of fiscal year 2017 (about $3.2 billion for fiscal year 2017 alone), and in July 2016 EUCOM identified funding needs for future posture initiatives. The expansion of ERI's objectives has contributed to DOD's enhancing its posture in Europe. Specifically, DOD has increased the size and duration of Army combat unit deployments, planned to preposition Army equipment in Eastern Europe, added new enduring locations (e.g., locations that DOD expects to access and use to support U.S. security interests for the foreseeable future), improved infrastructure, and negotiated new agreements with European nations. As of April 2017, DOD was considering further force enhancements under ERI as part of the department's ERI budget request. DOD also was reviewing whether new enduring locations to support ERI were needed and was considering other improvements to existing infrastructure. DOD's process for planning ERI has not established priorities among posture initiatives funded under ERI relative to those in its base budget, nor estimated long-term sustainment costs for some posture initiatives funded under ERI, nor communicated future costs to Congress. ERI is being planned using a separate process from DOD's established processes and is funded from DOD's overseas contingency operations (OCO) appropriations. GAO found several weaknesses: Lack of prioritization : DOD establishes priorities among ERI posture initiatives but has not evaluated them against base budget initiatives using its posture management process. As a result, DOD lacks an understanding of the relative importance of ERI initiatives and may be investing in projects that it will not continue should OCO funding become unavailable. Lack of sustainment costs : EUCOM and the military services have not fully estimated the long-term costs to sustain equipment and construction funded under ERI. Based on DOD's approach for calculating rough order sustainment costs, GAO determined that these costs could be substantial. DOD officials said that GAO correctly applied DOD's approach for estimating sustainment costs, but noted that actual costs may be lower, because the military services may not fully fund sustainment. In the absence of comprehensive estimates, DOD has been limited in its ability to assess affordability and plan for future costs. Not communicating future costs : DOD limits Congress's visibility into the resources needed to implement ERI and achieve its objectives because it does not include future costs in its ERI budget request.

However, these revenues are only available if appropriated by Congress. GOMESA revenues, which are mandatory, are used exclusively for state outdoor recreation grants. Since its inception, the LWCF has accumulated a balance of $22 billion due to low appropriation rates. The fund allocates at least 40% of its funds to federal land acquisition and 40% to state grants. Over the years, the fund has been used for federal land acquisition, state grants, and other purposes. Other purposes include maintenance of federal land management agencies, ecosystem restoration, and various other natural resource-related programs. From FY1998 to FY2019, $2.7 billion was allocated for other purposes, representing 27% of total appropriations. The Forest Legacy Program and Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund have received the largest shares of these funds. The report highlights the variability in annual appropriations for other purposes and the diverse range of programs that have benefited from LWCF funding.

The fund also receives mandatory appropriations under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (GOMESA). The level of annual appropriations for the LWCF has varied since the origin of the fund in FY1965. The LWCF Act outlines uses of the fund for federal and state purposes. Of the total made available through appropriations or deposits under GOMESA, not less than 40% is to be used for \"federal purposes\" and not less than 40% is to be used to provide \"financial assistance to states.\" The act lists the federal purposes for which the President is to allot LWCF funds \"unless otherwise allotted in the appropriation Act making them available.\" These purposes primarily relate to acquisition of lands and waters (and interests therein) by the federal government. With regard to state purposes, the act authorizes a matching grant program to states for outdoor recreation purposes. Throughout the LWCF's history, appropriations acts typically have provided funds for land acquisition and outdoor recreational grants to states. Beginning in FY1998, appropriations also have been provided each year (except FY1999) to fund other purposes related to natural resources. The extent to which the LWCF should be used for purposes other than federal land acquisition and outdoor recreation grants to states, and which other purposes should be funded from the LWCF, continue to be the subject of legislation and debate in Congress. In the past few decades, Presidents have sought LWCF funds for a variety of other purposes. Congress chooses which if any of these requests to fund, and has chosen programs not sought by the President for a particular year. Among other programs, appropriations have been provided for facility maintenance of the land management agencies, ecosystem restoration, the Historic Preservation Fund, the Payments in Lieu of Taxes program, the Forest Legacy Program, State and Tribal Wildlife Grants (under the Fish and Wildlife Service), the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund, U.S. Geological Survey science and cooperative programs, and Bureau of Indian Affairs Indian Land and Water Claim Settlements. Since FY1998, a total of $2.7 billion has been appropriated for other purposes, of a total LWCF appropriation of $18.9 billion over the history of the fund.

The LWCF Act authorizes the fund to receive $900 million annually, with the monies available only if appropriated by Congress (i.e., discretionary appropriations). The fund also receives mandatory appropriations under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (GOMESA). The level of annual appropriations for the LWCF has varied since the origin of the fund in FY1965. The LWCF Act outlines uses of the fund for federal and state purposes. Of the total made available through appropriations or deposits under GOMESA, not less than 40% is to be used for \"federal purposes\" and not less than 40% is to be used to provide \"financial assistance to states.\" The act lists the federal purposes for which the President is to allot LWCF funds \"unless otherwise allotted in the appropriation Act making them available.\" These purposes primarily relate to acquisition of lands and waters (and interests therein) by the federal government. With regard to state purposes, the act authorizes a matching grant program to states for outdoor recreation purposes. Throughout the LWCF's history, appropriations acts typically have provided funds for land acquisition and outdoor recreational grants to states. Beginning in FY1998, appropriations also have been provided each year (except FY1999) to fund other purposes related to natural resources. The extent to which the LWCF should be used for purposes other than federal land acquisition and outdoor recreation grants to states, and which other purposes should be funded from the LWCF, continue to be the subject of legislation and debate in Congress. In the past few decades, Presidents have sought LWCF funds for a variety of other purposes. Congress chooses which if any of these requests to fund, and has chosen programs not sought by the President for a particular year. Among other programs, appropriations have been provided for facility maintenance of the land management agencies, ecosystem restoration, the Historic Preservation Fund, the Payments in Lieu of Taxes program, the Forest Legacy Program, State and Tribal Wildlife Grants (under the Fish and Wildlife Service), the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund, U.S. Geological Survey science and cooperative programs, and Bureau of Indian Affairs Indian Land and Water Claim Settlements. Since FY1998, a total of $2.7 billion has been appropriated for other purposes, of a total LWCF appropriation of $18.9 billion over the history of the fund. The Fish and Wildlife Service and the Forest Service have received the largest shares of the total appropriations for other purposes, about $1.4 billion (53%) and $1.0.billion (38%), respectively, from FY1998 to FY2019. Several agencies shared the remaining $0.2 billion (9%) of the appropriations. Both the dollar amounts and the percentages of annual LWCF appropriations for other purposes have varied widely since FY1998. The dollar amounts have ranged from $0 in FY1999 to $456.0 million in FY2001. The percentage of annual funds provided for other purposes ranged from 0% in FY1999 to a high of 59% in both FY2006 and FY2007. In some years, the appropriation for other purposes was significantly less than the Administration requested. For instance, for FY2008, the George W. Bush Administration sought $313.1 million; the appropriation was $101.3 million. The appropriation for other purposes last exceeded $100.0 million in FY2010, and most recently was $93.3 million, in FY2019. Prior to FY2008, several other purposes typically were funded each year from LWCF.

{"pred": " \n\nThe Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act establishes the process for states or tribal entities to request a presidential disaster declaration and defines the federal government's role in response and recovery. FEMA plays a crucial role in recommending to the President whether to declare a disaster and coordinates the federal response. The IA program provides financial and direct assistance to disaster victims, including five distinct programs: Individuals and Households, Crisis Counseling, Disaster Legal Services, Disaster Case Management, and Disaster Unemployment Assistance. FEMA uses six regulatory factors to assess IA declaration requests, which include concentration of damages, trauma, special populations, voluntary agency assistance, insurance coverage, and average amount of individual assistance by state. Despite these factors, FEMA regional offices often do not consistently document all elements of the regulatory factors in their Regional Administrator's Validation and Recommendation (RVAR). This inconsistency raises concerns about the transparency and fairness of the IA declaration process. FEMA is planning to revise the six current IA regulatory factors to provide more objective criteria and clarify eligibility thresholds. However, some states have raised concerns about the proposed changes, particularly regarding the use of state fiscal capacity and resource availability data. The report concludes that FEMA should evaluate why regions are not consistently documenting all elements of the IA regulatory factors and take corrective action if necessary. This would help ensure consistency and fairness in the IA declaration process. Key evidence includes the number of IA declarations requested, the amount of actual obligations, and the varying levels of documentation across regions. Unique points include the challenges faced by states and FEMA regions in gathering information on IA regulatory factors and the potential impact of the proposed regulatory factor revisions. The report recommends that FEMA address these issues to improve the evaluation process. The estimated completion date for the planned actions is in the fall of 2018. The summary highlights the importance of FEMA's evaluation process and the need for transparency and consistency in the IA declaration process.

When a state, U.S. territory, or tribe requests IA assistance through a federal disaster declaration, FEMA evaluates the request against regulatory factors, such as concentration of damages, and provides a recommendation to the President, who makes a final declaration decision. GAO was asked to review FEMA's IA declaration process. This report examines (1) the number of IA declaration requests received, declared, and denied, and IA actual obligations from calendar years 2008 through 2016, (2) the extent to which FEMA accounts for the regulatory factors when evaluating IA requests, and (3) any challenges FEMA regions and select states reported on the declaration process and factors and any FEMA actions to revise them. GAO reviewed FEMA's policies, IA declaration requests and obligation data, and FEMA's RVARs from July 2012 through December 2016, the most recent years for which data were available. GAO also reviewed proposed rulemaking comments and interviewed FEMA officials from all 10 regions and 11 state emergency management offices selected based on declaration requests and other factors. From calendar years 2008 through 2016, the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Federal Emergency and Management Agency (FEMA) received 294 Individual Assistance (IA) declaration requests from states, U.S. territories, and tribes to help individuals meet their immediate needs after a disaster. Of these, the President declared 168 and denied 126 requests. Across the various types of IA declaration requests, severe storms (190) were the most common disaster type and drought (1) was among the least common. FEMA obligated about $8.6 billion in IA for disaster declarations during this period. GAO found that FEMA regions did not consistently obtain and document information on all elements of established IA regulatory factors when making IA recommendations to headquarters. Following a declaration request, a FEMA region is to prepare a Regional Administrator's Validation and Recommendation (RVAR)—a document designed to include data on each of the six IA regulatory factors for each declaration request as well as the regional administrator's recommendation. GAO reviewed all 81 RVARs from July 2012—the date FEMA began using the new RVAR template—through December 2016. GAO found that regions did not consistently obtain and document information for the elements required under the six regulatory factors (see table). For example, only 44 of the 81 RVARs documented all elements under the concentration of damage factor. By evaluating why regions are not completing all elements of each current IA regulatory factor, FEMA could identify whether any corrective steps are needed. Officials from the 10 FEMA regions and 11 states GAO interviewed, reported positive relationships with each other, but also cited various challenges with the IA declaration process and regulatory factors. For example, these officials told GAO that there are no established minimum thresholds for IA, making final determinations more subjective and the rationale behind denials unclear. However, as required by the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013, FEMA has taken steps to revise the IA factors by issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking. According to FEMA, the proposed rule aims to provide more objective criteria, clarify the threshold for eligibility, and speed up the IA declaration process. As of April 2018, the proposed rule was still under consideration. According to FEMA officials, they plan to finalize the rule in late 2018; therefore, it is too early to know the extent to which it will address these challenges. GAO recommends that FEMA evaluate why regions are not completing the RVARs for each element of the current IA regulatory factors and take corrective steps, if necessary.

Key events included the introduction of resolutions to limit arms sales to Saudi Arabia, debates over the War Powers Resolution, and the eventual imposition of conditions on U.S. support for coalition operations. The passage highlights the tension between maintaining U.S.-Saudi relations and addressing human rights concerns and humanitarian needs in Yemen. Notably, the U.S. took steps to limit its involvement, such as suspending the transfer of precision munitions and reducing intelligence sharing, but continued to support counterterrorism efforts. The conflict's duration and the humanitarian crisis it caused led to growing congressional scrutiny and calls for a more robust response, culminating in the passage of legislation that imposed conditions on U.S. support for the coalition. The passage concludes by noting that while the U.S. may no longer be directly involved in the conflict, the humanitarian situation in Yemen remains dire, suggesting ongoing challenges for U.S. policymakers.

Initially, Presidents exercised emergency powers at their discretion, often through proclamations, but this changed with the growth of standby emergency authority during and after World War I. The passage highlights how emergency powers have increasingly become rooted in statutory law rather than relying solely on constitutional authority. Key events, such as President Lincoln's actions during the Civil War, illustrate the tension between executive discretion and legislative oversight. The National Emergencies Act aimed to provide a structured framework for declaring and regulating national emergencies, including automatic termination after one year and requiring presidential notification of continued emergencies. The act also mandated reporting requirements and specified which emergency powers could be activated. Since its enactment, numerous national emergencies have been declared, but the act has not been significantly revised. The passage concludes by noting an unusual instance where a national emergency was declared to suspend wage requirements without formally declaring a national emergency, suggesting potential ambiguities in the application of emergency powers. The unique point is the shift from discretionary executive action to statutory delegation and regulation, emphasizing the evolving relationship between the executive and legislative branches in managing crises.

Of the total $12.5 billion benefit payments in the same fiscal year, 60.0% was paid to retired workers, 8.0% to disabled workers, 14.4% to spouses, and 16.8% to survivors. The Railroad Retirement Act (RRA) authorizes retirement, disability, and survivor benefits for railroad workers and their families. RRA is financed primarily by payroll taxes, financial interchanges from Social Security, and transfers from the National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust (NRRIT). Railroad retirement payroll taxes have two tiers: the Tier I tax is essentially the same as the Social Security payroll tax and the Tier II tax is set each year based on the railroad retirement system's asset balances, benefit payments, and administrative costs. In FY2017, the gross RRA funding was about $12.7 billion. Railroad retirement annuities are also divided into two tiers. Tier I annuities are designed to be nearly equivalent to Social Security benefits and are based on both railroad retirement and Social Security-covered employment. However, Tier I annuities are more generous than Social Security benefits in certain situations. For example, at the age of 60, railroad workers with at least 30 years of covered railroad work may receive unreduced retirement annuities. Tier II annuities are similar to private pensions and based solely on covered railroad service. Tier II annuities are paid in addition to Tier I annuities. Railroad disability annuities may be payable to totally disabled railroad workers who are permanently disabled from all work and occupational disabled workers who are found to be permanently disabled from their regular railroad occupations. Eligible spouses and survivors of railroad workers may receive a certain portion of Tier I and Tier II benefits, but divorced spouses and surviving divorced spouses are eligible for only a certain portion of Tier I benefits. The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act (RUIA) authorizes unemployment and sickness benefits for railroad workers. RUIA is financed solely by railroad employers, whose contributions are based on the taxable earnings of their employees.

The ACV is designed to enhance the Marines' amphibious and land operations capabilities, including self-deployment from amphibious shipping, traversing rough seas, and operating in various terrains. The ACV Increment 1.1, which entered the acquisition cycle in 2016, is an eight-wheeled vehicle capable of carrying 10 Marines and a crew of 3, with a focus on affordability and survivability. After a competitive process, BAE Systems was selected to produce the ACV 1.1 in 2018, with the first 30 vehicles to be delivered by 2019. The ACV 1.2, a tracked version, is being developed to improve amphibious capabilities, including higher water speeds and self-deployment from ships. The consolidation of ACV 1.1 and ACV 1.2 into a single program is expected to streamline production and potentially reduce costs. However, the adoption of Expeditionary Advance Base Operations (EABO) as an operational concept may necessitate further modifications to the ACV program, impacting its acquisition timeline and cost. The Marine Corps' acquisition priorities and budget constraints have influenced the development and implementation of the ACV program, highlighting the importance of balancing technological advancements with fiscal considerations. The ACV program faces challenges in meeting the legal requirement for amphibious and land operations, as well as addressing the evolving threat landscape and the need for a robust amphibious assault capability in the context of potential peer adversaries. The program's progress and future direction are closely monitored by Congress, which may scrutinize the ACV's role in national security and its cost-effectiveness. The ACV program's success hinges on overcoming technical hurdles, ensuring affordability, and adapting to emerging operational concepts like EABO.

Because the EFV was intended to replace the 40-year-old Amphibious Assault Vehicle (AAV), the Pentagon pledged to move quickly to develop a \"more affordable and sustainable\" vehicle to replace the EFV. The Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV) is intended to replace the AAV, incorporating some EFV capabilities but in a more practical and cost-efficient manner. In concert with the ACV, the Marines were developing the Marine Personnel Carrier (MPC) to serve as a survivable and mobile platform to transport Marines when ashore. The MPC was not intended to be amphibious like an AAV, EFV, or the ACV but instead would be required to have a swim capability for inland waterways such as rivers, lakes, and other water obstacles such as shore-to-shore operations in the littorals. Both vehicles were intended to play central roles in future Marine amphibious operations. On June 14, 2013, Marine leadership put the MPC program \"on ice\" due to budgetary pressures but suggested the program might be resurrected some 10 years down the road when budgetary resources might be more favorable. In what was described as a \"drastic shift,\" the Marines decided to \"resurrect\" the MPC in March 2014. The Marines designated the MPC as ACV Increment 1.1 and planned to acquire about 200 vehicles. The Marines also plan to develop ACV Increment 1.2, a tracked, fully amphibious version, and at the time planned to acquire about 470 vehicles and fund an ongoing high water speed study. Although ACV Increment 1.1 is to have a swim capability, another mode of transport (ship or aircraft) would be required to get the vehicles from ship to shore. The Marines are reportedly exploring the possibility of developing a high water speed ACV 2.0, which could accompany tanks and light armored vehicles into combat. On November 5, 2014, the Marines released a draft Request for Proposal (RFP) for ACV Increment 1.1. On November 24, 2015, the Marine Corps awarded BAE Systems and SAIC contracts to develop ACV 1.1 prototypes for evaluation. BAE's contract was for $103.8 million and SAIC's for $121.5 million, and each company was to build 16 prototypes to be tested over the next two years. Both BAE and SAIC delivered their prototypes early, and Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) testing began mid-March 2017. In early December 2017, the Marines reportedly sent the ACV 1.1 down select request for proposals to BAE and Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC). On June 19, 2018, the Marine Corps selected BAE Systems to produce the ACV. The initial contract—valued at $198 million—was for low-rate production of 30 vehicles to be delivered by the autumn of 2019. On April 10, 2019, during testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee, Navy and Marine Corps leadership announced that during the fall of 2018, ACV 1.1 prototypes demonstrated satisfactory water mobility performance in high surf conditions and, in doing so, met the full water mobility transition requirement for ACV 1.2 capability. As a result, ACV 1.1 and ACV 1.2 were to be consolidated into a single variant—the ACV—which is intended to replace all AAVs.

DHS inspects high-risk facilities after it approves facility security plans to ensure that the facilities are implementing required security measures and procedures. This statement summarizes progress and challenges related to DHS's CFATS program management. This statement is based on prior products GAO issued from July 2012 through June 2017, along with updates conducted in June 2018 on DHS actions to address prior GAO recommendations. To conduct the prior work, GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and DHS policies for administering the CFATS program, how DHS assesses risk, and data on high-risk chemical facilities. GAO also interviewed DHS officials and reviewed information on DHS actions to implement its prior recommendations. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has made progress addressing challenges that GAO's past work identified to managing the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) program. The following summarizes progress made and challenges remaining in key aspects of the program. Identifying high-risk chemical facilities. In July 2015, GAO reported that DHS used self-reported and unverified data to determine the risk of facilities holding toxic chemicals that could threaten surrounding communities if released. GAO recommended that DHS should better verify the accuracy of facility-reported data. DHS implemented this recommendation by revising its methodology so it now calculates the risk of toxic release, rather than relying on facilities to do so. Assessing risk and prioritizing facilities. In April 2013, GAO reported weaknesses in multiple aspects of DHS's risk assessment and prioritization approach. GAO made two recommendations for DHS to review and improve this process, including that DHS enhance its risk assessment approach to incorporate all of the elements of consequence, threat, and vulnerability associated with a terrorist attack involving certain chemicals. DHS launched a new risk assessment methodology in October 2016 and is currently gathering new or updated data from about 27,000 facilities to (1) determine which facilities should be categorized as high-risk because of the threat of sabotage, theft or diversion, or a toxic release and (2) assign those facilities deemed high risk to one of four risk-based tiers. GAO has ongoing work assessing these efforts and will report later this summer on the extent to which they fully address prior recommendations. Reviewing and approving facilities' site security plans . DHS is to review security plans and visit facilities to ensure their security measures meet DHS standards. In April 2013, GAO reported a 7 to 9 year backlog for these reviews and visits. In July 2015, GAO reported that DHS had made substantial progress in addressing the backlog—estimating that it could take between 9 and 12 months for DHS to review and approve security plans for the approximately 900 remaining facilities. DHS has since taken additional action to expedite these activities and has eliminated this backlog. Inspecting facilities and ensuring compliance. In July 2015, GAO reported that DHS conducted compliance inspections at 83 of the 1,727 facilities with approved security plans. GAO found that nearly half of the inspected facilities were not fully compliant with their approved security plans and that DHS did not have documented procedures for managing facilities' compliance. GAO recommended that DHS document procedures for managing compliance. As a result, DHS has developed an enforcement procedure and a draft compliance inspection procedure and expects to finalize the compliance inspection procedure by the end of fiscal year 2018. GAO has made various recommendations to strengthen DHS's management of the CFATS program, with which DHS has generally agreed.

Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act establishes the process for states or tribal entities to request a presidential disaster declaration and defines the federal government's role in response and recovery. FEMA plays a crucial role in recommending to the President whether to declare a disaster and coordinates the federal response. The IA program provides financial and direct assistance to disaster victims, including five distinct programs: Individuals and Households, Crisis Counseling, Disaster Legal Services, Disaster Case Management, and Disaster Unemployment Assistance. FEMA uses six regulatory factors to assess IA declaration requests, which include concentration of damages, trauma, special populations, voluntary agency assistance, insurance coverage, and average amount of individual assistance by state. Despite these factors, FEMA regional offices often do not consistently document all elements of the regulatory factors in their Regional Administrator's Validation and Recommendation (RVAR). This inconsistency raises concerns about the transparency and fairness of the IA declaration process. FEMA is planning to revise the six current IA regulatory factors to provide more objective criteria and clarify eligibility thresholds. However, some states have raised concerns about the proposed changes, particularly regarding the use of state fiscal capacity and resource availability data. The report concludes that FEMA should evaluate why regions are not consistently documenting all elements of the IA regulatory factors and take corrective action if necessary. This would help ensure consistency and fairness in the IA declaration process. Key evidence includes the number of IA declarations requested, the amount of actual obligations, and the varying levels of documentation across regions.

When a state, U.S. territory, or tribe requests IA assistance through a federal disaster declaration, FEMA evaluates the request against regulatory factors, such as concentration of damages, and provides a recommendation to the President, who makes a final declaration decision. GAO was asked to review FEMA's IA declaration process. This report examines (1) the number of IA declaration requests received, declared, and denied, and IA actual obligations from calendar years 2008 through 2016, (2) the extent to which FEMA accounts for the regulatory factors when evaluating IA requests, and (3) any challenges FEMA regions and select states reported on the declaration process and factors and any FEMA actions to revise them. GAO reviewed FEMA's policies, IA declaration requests and obligation data, and FEMA's RVARs from July 2012 through December 2016, the most recent years for which data were available. GAO also reviewed proposed rulemaking comments and interviewed FEMA officials from all 10 regions and 11 state emergency management offices selected based on declaration requests and other factors. From calendar years 2008 through 2016, the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Federal Emergency and Management Agency (FEMA) received 294 Individual Assistance (IA) declaration requests from states, U.S. territories, and tribes to help individuals meet their immediate needs after a disaster. Of these, the President declared 168 and denied 126 requests. Across the various types of IA declaration requests, severe storms (190) were the most common disaster type and drought (1) was among the least common. FEMA obligated about $8.6 billion in IA for disaster declarations during this period. GAO found that FEMA regions did not consistently obtain and document information on all elements of established IA regulatory factors when making IA recommendations to headquarters. Following a declaration request, a FEMA region is to prepare a Regional Administrator's Validation and Recommendation (RVAR)—a document designed to include data on each of the six IA regulatory factors for each declaration request as well as the regional administrator's recommendation. GAO reviewed all 81 RVARs from July 2012—the date FEMA began using the new RVAR template—through December 2016. GAO found that regions did not consistently obtain and document information for the elements required under the six regulatory factors (see table). For example, only 44 of the 81 RVARs documented all elements under the concentration of damage factor. By evaluating why regions are not completing all elements of each current IA regulatory factor, FEMA could identify whether any corrective steps are needed. Officials from the 10 FEMA regions and 11 states GAO interviewed, reported positive relationships with each other, but also cited various challenges with the IA declaration process and regulatory factors. For example, these officials told GAO that there are no established minimum thresholds for IA, making final determinations more subjective and the rationale behind denials unclear. However, as required by the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013, FEMA has taken steps to revise the IA factors by issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking. According to FEMA, the proposed rule aims to provide more objective criteria, clarify the threshold for eligibility, and speed up the IA declaration process. As of April 2018, the proposed rule was still under consideration. According to FEMA officials, they plan to finalize the rule in late 2018; therefore, it is too early to know the extent to which it will address these challenges.

Executive branch agencies are required to annually estimate improper payments for certain programs. Estimation of improper payments is key to understanding the extent of the problem and to developing effective corrective actions. Relevant laws and guidance provide agencies flexibility in developing estimates. This report describes agencies' processes to estimate improper payments in selected programs for fiscal year 2017 and the extent to which certain differences in these processes can affect the usefulness of the resulting estimates. GAO selected 10 programs across six agencies with the largest reported program outlays in fiscal years 2015 and 2016. For these programs, GAO reviewed relevant laws and guidance, analyzed agencies' policies and procedures, and interviewed officials at relevant agencies and OMB staff. The six agencies GAO reviewed reported taking various approaches related to key components of estimating improper payments—shown in the figure below—for 10 selected programs, which collectively reported outlays of over $2.5 trillion for fiscal year 2017. Sample selection. Eight of the 10 programs GAO reviewed reported using statistically valid approaches, and the remaining 2 reported using alternative methodologies approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The sampled data elements varied, including payments, medical claims, and tax returns. The age of the data used to develop fiscal year 2017 improper payment estimates also varied, ranging from calendar year 2013 to fiscal year 2017. Identification of improper payments. Some of the six agencies reported using processes designed specifically to estimate improper payments, whereas others reported leveraging existing reviews. These agencies' policies and procedures include a review of aspects of eligibility, except for those related to the Department of Defense's (DOD) Military Pay and the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) Retirement overpayments. DOD and OPM have not fully assessed whether their estimation processes effectively consider key program risks. OMB guidance does not specifically address how agencies are to test to identify improper payments, such as using a risk-based approach to help ensure that key risks of improper payments are addressed. The six agencies also varied in the treatment of insufficient documentation, both in identifying and in reporting the root causes of improper payments. For the agencies that contact entities outside the agency to estimate improper payments, the treatment of nonresponse differed, with one agency including nonresponses as improper payments and another generally excluding the nonresponse cases from review. Although OMB guidance states that agencies should treat cases of insufficient documentation as improper payments, it does not specifically address the treatment of nonresponse cases. Calculation of the improper payment estimate. The six agencies generally reported using law and OMB guidance to calculate improper payment estimates for the selected programs, except for the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) removed overpayments that were recovered when developing its estimate. OMB guidance requires agencies to include recovered amounts in their estimates. Removing these overpayments understates the EITC improper payment estimate and may limit IRS's ability to develop corrective actions to prevent improper payments. GAO recommends that OMB develop guidance on treatment of nonresponse cases and testing to identify improper payments, that DOD and OPM assess their estimation processes, and that IRS revise its methodology to not exclude recovered payments from its estimate. All of the agencies either agreed or partially agreed with the specific recommendations to them. GAO believes that the actions are warranted, as discussed in the report."], "length": 5207}

The program faced significant challenges, including a lack of a documented strategy, leadership instability, and inadequate clinician involvement in the initial requirements development process. As a result, the initial formulary did not adequately meet the needs of medical centers, leading to low utilization rates and missed cost-saving opportunities. The program office attempted to address these issues in Phase 2 by increasing clinician involvement, but faced further delays and resource constraints. Despite these efforts, the program has not achieved its goals of standardizing supplies, reducing costs, and ensuring clinical consistency. The report recommends improvements in planning, leadership, and stakeholder engagement to enhance the program's effectiveness. Key evidence includes the low utilization rates, the reliance on non-competitive contracts, and the failure to meet cost avoidance targets. Unique points include the contrast between VHA's approach and leading hospital networks' practices in supply chain management and the potential risks of gaps in contract coverage during the transition to competitive awards. The report concludes that significant challenges remain in fully realizing the program's intended benefits. The VHA has acknowledged the recommendations and is taking steps to address the identified issues. However, the program's progress remains uncertain due to ongoing resource constraints and the need for sustained commitment from leadership.

VA began developing requirements in early 2015 and launched the program in December 2016. This testimony summarizes key information contained in GAO's November 2017 report, GAO-18-34 . Specifically, it addresses the extent to which VA's implementation of MSPV-NG has been effective in meeting program goals. GAO analyzed VA's requirements development and contracting processes, and identified key supply chain practices cited by four leading hospital networks. GAO also met with contracting and clinical officials at six medical centers, selected based on high dollar contract obligations in fiscal years 2014-2016 and geographic representation. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) established the Medical Surgical Prime Vendor-Next Generation (MSPV-NG) program to provide an efficient, cost-effective way for its facilities to order supplies, but its initial implementation did not have an overarching strategy, stable leadership, and workforce capacity that could have facilitated medical center buy-in for the change. VA also developed requirements for a broad range of MSPV-NG items with limited clinical input. Further, starting in June 2015, VA planned to award competitive contracts, but instead, 79 percent of the items available for purchase under MSPV-NG were added through non-competitive agreements.

{"pred": " \n\nThe Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) Act of 1965 aims to preserve and develop outdoor recreation resources, facilitating participation in recreation and enhancing the health and vitality of U.S. citizens. The fund, authorized to receive $900 million annually, primarily generates revenues from oil and gas leases on the Outer Continental Shelf, motorboat fuel taxes, and surplus property sales. However, only about 46.5% of the accumulated funds have been appropriated by Congress, leaving a balance of approximately $22 billion unappropriated. Since 1998, the LWCF has been used to fund other purposes beyond federal land acquisition and state outdoor recreation grants, including maintenance needs of federal land management agencies, ecosystem restoration, and various natural resource-related programs. The largest shares of the $2.7 billion appropriated for other purposes went to the Forest Legacy Program and the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund, totaling 63% of the total. The Forest Legacy Program focuses on acquiring private forests to prevent conversion to non-forest uses, while the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund supports species and habitat conservation actions on non-federal lands. Despite the potential for expanded funding, concerns remain among traditional LWCF advocates about the impact of reallocating funds away from land acquisition and state grants. The passage highlights the variability in annual appropriations for other purposes, ranging from $60 million in 1998 to $456 million in 2001, reflecting the dynamic nature of how Congress allocates funds from the LWCF. The data show that while the fund's total appropriations have fluctuated, the percentage of funds allocated to other purposes has also varied widely, peaking at 59% in 2006 and 2007. The unique aspect of the LWCF is its dual funding mechanism, combining discretionary appropriations with mandatory GOMESA revenues, allowing for a more stable funding base for conservation efforts.

The fund also receives mandatory appropriations under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (GOMESA). The level of annual appropriations for the LWCF has varied since the origin of the fund in FY1965. The LWCF Act outlines uses of the fund for federal and state purposes. Of the total made available through appropriations or deposits under GOMESA, not less than 40% is to be used for \"federal purposes\" and not less than 40% is to be used to provide \"financial assistance to states.\" The act lists the federal purposes for which the President is to allot LWCF funds \"unless otherwise allotted in the appropriation Act making them available.\" These purposes primarily relate to acquisition of lands and waters (and interests therein) by the federal government. With regard to state purposes, the act authorizes a matching grant program to states for outdoor recreation purposes. Throughout the LWCF's history, appropriations acts typically have provided funds for land acquisition and outdoor recreational grants to states. Beginning in FY1998, appropriations also have been provided each year (except FY1999) to fund other purposes related to natural resources. The extent to which the LWCF should be used for purposes other than federal land acquisition and outdoor recreation grants to states, and which other purposes should be funded from the LWCF, continue to be the subject of legislation and debate in Congress. In the past few decades, Presidents have sought LWCF funds for a variety of other purposes. Congress chooses which if any of these requests to fund, and has chosen programs not sought by the President for a particular year. Among other programs, appropriations have been provided for facility maintenance of the land management agencies, ecosystem restoration, the Historic Preservation Fund, the Payments in Lieu of Taxes program, the Forest Legacy Program, State and Tribal Wildlife Grants (under the Fish and Wildlife Service), the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund, U.S. Geological Survey science and cooperative programs, and Bureau of Indian Affairs Indian Land and Water Claim Settlements. Since FY1998, a total of $2.7 billion has been appropriated for other purposes, of a total LWCF appropriation of $18.9 billion over the history of the fund. The Fish and Wildlife Service and the Forest Service have received the largest shares of the total appropriations for other purposes, about $1.4 billion (53%) and $1.0.billion (38%), respectively, from FY1998 to FY2019. Several agencies shared the remaining $0.2 billion (9%) of the appropriations. Both the dollar amounts and the percentages of annual LWCF appropriations for other purposes have varied widely since FY1998.

Of the total $12.5 billion benefit payments in the same fiscal year, 60.0% was paid to retired workers, 8.0% to disabled workers, 14.4% to spouses, and 16.8% to survivors. The Railroad Retirement Act (RRA) authorizes retirement, disability, and survivor benefits for railroad workers and their families. RRA is financed primarily by payroll taxes, financial interchanges from Social Security, and transfers from the National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust (NRRIT). Railroad retirement payroll taxes have two tiers: the Tier I tax is essentially the same as the Social Security payroll tax and the Tier II tax is set each year based on the railroad retirement system's asset balances, benefit payments, and administrative costs. In FY2017, the gross RRA funding was about $12.7 billion. Railroad retirement annuities are also divided into two tiers. Tier I annuities are designed to be nearly equivalent to Social Security benefits and are based on both railroad retirement and Social Security-covered employment. However, Tier I annuities are more generous than Social Security benefits in certain situations. For example, at the age of 60, railroad workers with at least 30 years of covered railroad work may receive unreduced retirement annuities. Tier II annuities are similar to private pensions and based solely on covered railroad service. Tier II annuities are paid in addition to Tier I annuities. Railroad disability annuities may be payable to totally disabled railroad workers who are permanently disabled from all work and occupational disabled workers who are found to be permanently disabled from their regular railroad occupations.

NCA's goal is to provide reasonable access to burial options for 95% of veterans, with plans to establish 18 new national cemeteries, including five traditional and 13 urban and rural initiative sites. Challenges in land acquisition, cost estimation, and data utilization have delayed the opening of some planned cemeteries. NCA's cost-estimating guidance for cemetery construction projects does not fully incorporate best practices, leading to unreliable cost estimates. Using census tract data to estimate served and unserved veteran populations could enhance NCA's decision-making. As of September 2019, only six out of 18 planned sites were open, with NCA years behind its original schedule. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs should ensure NCA updates its cost-estimating procedures to fully incorporate best practices. The progress in increasing burial access for veterans has been limited, but the opening of six sites has improved accessibility. NCA's methodology uses county-level data, which may not accurately reflect the true number of unserved veterans. The use of census tract data could provide a more precise estimate and help NCA better target areas with significant unserved veteran populations.

Within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) has a plan to establish 18 new national cemeteries to increase reasonable access to burial options for veterans. NCA defines reasonable access as a national or state veterans' cemetery being located within 75 miles of veterans' homes. Key parts of NCA's plan include establishing 13 urban and rural initiative national cemeteries and awarding grant funds to state applicants for establishing new state veterans' cemeteries. NCA has made limited progress in implementing its plan to increase burial access and is years behind its original schedule for opening new cemeteries. For example, NCA has opened only two of its planned urban and rural initiative sites and is behind its original schedule for the other 11 (see fig. below). The primary factor delaying NCA's completion of these cemeteries has been challenges in acquiring suitable land. NCA has also been challenged in producing accurate estimates of construction costs for most of its rural initiative sites. Cost estimates have increased more than 200 percent (from about $7 million to $24 million) for these sites, and NCA's guidance for developing cost estimates for the cemeteries does not fully incorporate the 12 steps identified in cost-estimating leading practices—such as conducting a risk and uncertainty analysis or a sensitivity analysis. As a result, NCA is not well positioned to provide reliable and valid cost estimates to better inform decisions to enhance veterans' cemetery access.

{"pred": " \n\nPassage 2 discusses the concept of funding gaps in federal agencies and how they affect government operations. Since the shift to a fiscal year starting on October 1, 1977, funding gaps have occurred in nearly every fiscal year, with the longest lasting up to 34 days. The Antideficiency Act generally prohibits federal agencies from incurring obligations or expenditures without appropriations. In the event of a funding gap, agencies must cease operations and furlough non-excepted personnel. The Civiletti opinions from 1980 and 1981 clarified that agencies can incur obligations for safety and property protection, but most operations must stop. Funding gaps have varied in duration and impact, with some resulting in significant disruptions and others having minimal effects. Notable funding gaps occurred in 1995, 2013, 2018, and 2019, each leading to widespread furloughs and shutdowns of non-excepted activities. The passage highlights the importance of avoiding funding gaps through timely enactment of appropriations or automatic continuing resolutions (ACRs) to ensure continuous government operations. Key evidence includes the frequency and duration of funding gaps, the impact on federal employees, and the guidance provided by the Civiletti opinions. Unique points include the distinction between funding gaps and shutdowns, and the potential for ACRs to mitigate the risk of funding gaps. The passage underscores the need for improved budget processes to prevent funding gaps and ensure the continuity of essential government functions.

The Civiletti opinions from 1980 and 1", "answers": ["The Antideficiency Act (31 U.S.C. 1341-1342, 1511-1519) generally bars the obligation of funds in the absence of appropriations. Exceptions are made under the act, including for activities involving \"the safety of human life or the protection of property.\" The interval during the fiscal year when appropriations for a particular project or activity are not enacted into law, either in the form of a regular appropriations act or a continuing resolution (CR), is referred to as a funding gap or funding lapse. Although funding gaps may occur at the start of the fiscal year, they may also occur any time a CR expires and another CR (or the regular appropriations bill) is not enacted immediately thereafter. Multiple funding gaps may occur within a fiscal year. When a funding gap occurs, federal agencies are generally required to begin a shutdown of the affected projects and activities, which includes the prompt furlough of non-excepted personnel. The general practice of the federal government after the shutdown has ended has been to retroactively pay furloughed employees for the time they missed, as well as employees who were required to come to work. Although a shutdown may be the result of a funding gap, the two events should be distinguished. This is because a funding gap may result in a total shutdown of all affected projects or activities in some instances but not others. For example, when funding gaps are of a short duration, agencies may not have enough time to complete a shutdown of affected projects and activities before funding is restored. In addition, the Office of Management and Budget has previously indicated that a shutdown of agency operations within the first day of the funding gap may be postponed if a resolution appears to be imminent. Since FY1977, 20 funding gaps occurred, ranging in duration from 1 day to 34 full days. These funding gaps are listed in Table 1. About half of these funding gaps were brief (i.e., three days or less in duration). Notably, many of the funding gaps do not appear to have resulted in a \"shutdown.\" Prior to the issuance of the opinions in 1980 and early 1981 by then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti, while agencies tended to curtail some operations in response to a funding gap, they often \"continued to operate during periods of expired funding.\" In addition, some of the funding gaps after the Civiletti opinions did not result in a completion of shutdown operations due to both the funding gap's short duration and an expectation that appropriations would soon be enacted. Some of the funding gaps during this period, however, did have a broader impact on affected government operations, even if only for a matter of hours. Two funding gaps occurred in FY1996, amounting to 5 days and 21 days. The chronology of regular and continuing appropriations enacted during FY1996 is illustrated in Figure 1. At the beginning of FY2014 (October 1, 2013), none of the regular appropriations bills had been enacted, so a government-wide funding gap occurred. It concluded on October 17, 2013, after lasting 16 full days. During FY2018, there was a funding gap when a CR covering all of the regular appropriations bills expired on January 19, 2018. It concluded on January 22, 2018, after lasting two full days. The most recent funding gap occurred during FY2019, when a CR covering federal agencies and activities funded in 7 of the 12 regular appropriations bills expired on December 21, 2018. It concluded on January 25, 2019, after lasting 34 full days.

{"pred": " \n\nThe federal government owns approximately 640 million acres, primarily in the western states, managed by four agencies: National Park Service (NPS), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and U.S. Forest Service (USFS). These agencies have varying authorities to acquire and dispose of federal lands. The NPS lacks general authority to acquire new lands, while the BLM has broad authority to acquire and dispose of lands. The FWS can acquire lands but cannot dispose of them without Congressional approval, except through exchanges or if lands are no longer needed. The USFS has limited acquisition and disposal authorities, mainly for lands within or contiguous to national forests. Congress often debates the adequacy and use of these authorities, and various bills propose modifications or eliminations. Funding for land acquisition comes primarily from the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), with additional sources like the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund (MBCF) for specific agencies. The BLM has broad land disposal authorities, including exchanges, sales, and transfers, while the NPS, FWS, and USFS have more limited disposal authorities. Key evidence includes the varying acquisition and disposal authorities granted by Congress and the specific laws governing each agency's actions. Unique points include the importance of the MBCF for FWS land acquisitions and the broad land disposal authorities of the BLM. Congress frequently considers legislation to address the extent of federal land ownership and funding mechanisms for land acquisition. The BLM's Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act provides a significant revenue stream for land acquisition and development in Nevada. The General Mining Law of 1872, though still in effect, has been largely suspended due to annual moratoria since FY1995. The FWS's Migratory Bird Conservation Act and the USFS's various acquisition authorities are notable for their predictability and permanence in funding. The NPS's inability to dispose of lands without Congressional approval highlights the strict preservation focus of the agency. The BLM's ability to use eminent domain for land acquisition and its broad land disposal authorities underscore the agency's role in balancing resource management and public access. The varying authorities and funding mechanisms reflect the complex interplay between federal land management and public policy. The passage outlines the diverse authorities and funding mechanisms for federal land management agencies, emphasizing the unique roles and constraints of each agency in acquiring and disposing of federal lands. The BLM stands out with its broadest authorities, while the NPS has the narrowest. Congress plays a", "answers": ["The federal government owns roughly 640 million acres, heavily concentrated in 12 western states. Four agencies—the National Park Service (NPS), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in the Department of the Interior, and the U.S. Forest Service (FS) in the Department of Agriculture—administer about 95% of those lands. The extent to which each of these four federal agencies have authority to acquire and dispose of land varies considerably. The BLM has relatively broad authority for both acquisitions and disposals under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA). The agency also has other authorities for disposing of land, including two laws that allow the agency to retain the proceeds for subsequent land acquisition, among other purposes, and a law that allows transfers to governmental units and other entities for public purposes. By contrast, the NPS has no general authority to acquire land to create new park units or to dispose of park lands. The FS authority to acquire lands is mostly limited to lands within or contiguous to the boundaries of a national forest. The agency has various authorities to dispose of land, but they are relatively constrained and infrequently used. The FWS has various authorities to acquire lands but no general authority to dispose of its lands. The agency frequently uses acquisition authority under the Migratory Bird Conservation Act of 1929 because of the availability of funding through the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund. The nature of the acquisition and disposal authorities of the four federal agencies also varies. In general, the acquisition authorities are designed to allow the four agencies to bring into federal ownership lands that many contend could benefit from federal management. Disposal authorities generally are designed to allow agencies to convey land that is no longer needed for a federal purpose or that might be chiefly valuable for another purpose. Some of the authorities specify particular circumstances where they can be used, such as the conveyance of FS land for educational purposes and the disposal of BLM land for recreation and public purposes. Congress often faces questions on the adequacy of existing acquisition and disposal authorities; the nature, extent, and location of their use; and the extent of federal land ownership overall. The current acquisition and disposal authorities form the backdrop for consideration of measures to establish, modify, or eliminate authorities, or to provide for the acquisition or disposal of particular lands. In some cases, Congress enacts bills to provide authority to acquire or dispose of particular parcels where no standing authority exists and, in other cases, to direct or facilitate land transactions. Congress also addresses acquisition and disposal policy in the context of debates on the role and goals of the federal government in owning and managing land generally, and it has considered broader measures to dispose of lands or to promote acquisition. Other issues for Congress pertain to the sources and levels of funds for land acquisition. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) is the primary source of funding for land acquisition. Congress has considered diverse measures related to the LWCF, such as legislation to make LWCF funding permanent and bills to direct LWCF monies to additional, nonacquisition purposes. Additionally, the FWS has the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund, an account with mandatory spending authority supported by revenue from three sources. The BLM also has mandatory spending authorities that allow the proceeds from land sales to be used for land acquisition, among other purposes."], "length": 6617}

The conflicts 2001 to the present have greatly increased the number of Purple Hearts awarded to servicemembers. Events over the past few years have spurred debate on the eligibility criteria for the Purple Heart. Shootings on U.S. soil and medical conditions such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have prompted changes to the eligibility requirements for the Purple Heart. Some critics believe that these changes may lessen the value of the medal and the sacrifices of past recipients on the battlefield. In the past, efforts to modify the Purple Heart's eligibility requirements were contentious, and veterans groups were vocal concerning eligibility changes. While medal requirements are often left to the military and executive branch to decide, Congress is involved in Purple Heart eligibility, utilizing its constitutional power \"To Make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces\" (U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 8, clause 14). The Carl Levin and Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 (P.L. 113-291) included language that expands eligibility for the Purple Heart. Previous debates have raised several questions about the Purple Heart. In some respects, how an event is defined can determine eligibility: Is a servicemember the victim of a crime or a terrorist attack? Conversely, arguing that killed or wounded servicemembers \"should\" be eligible for the Purple Heart can redefine an event: Is the servicemember an advisor to a foreign military or a combatant? Are PTSD and other mental health conditions adequate injuries to warrant the Purple Heart? These are questions that Congress might consider if it chooses to act on this issue."], "length": 6659}

This assistance aims to build a more democratic, stable, and prosperous Palestinian society, benefiting the Palestinians, the United States, and Israel. In fiscal years 2015 and 2016, USAID obligated approximately $544.5 million, with about 99% of the funds going towards project assistance and debt relief payments to PA creditors. Project assistance was allocated across three main objectives: Economic Growth and Infrastructure, Investing in the Next Generation, and Governance and Civic Engagement. Debt relief payments to PA creditors accounted for around 26% and 28% of the obligations in fiscal years 2015 and 2016, respectively. USAID ensures that assistance does not support entities or individuals associated with terrorism through vetting processes and external assessments of the PA's financial systems. Despite some weaknesses identified in these systems, USAID believes the vetting process mitigates risks. Additionally, USAID conducts financial audits of the PA's financial records to ensure compliance with grant agreements. The overall status of ESF assistance and projects provided to the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016, including payments to PA creditors, was examined. USAID's compliance with vetting procedures and assessments of PA ministries' capacity to use ESF assistance as intended was also evaluated. Key evidence includes detailed financial data, USAID documents, and interviews with officials. Unique points include the distinction between direct payments to the PA and payments to PA creditors, and the rationale behind USAID's decision to continue making payments to creditors.

According to the Department of State, this assistance to the Palestinians promotes U.S. economic and political foreign policy interests by supporting Middle East peace negotiations and financing economic stabilization programs. USAID is primarily responsible for administering ESF assistance to the West Bank and Gaza. Appropriations acts for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 included provisions for GAO to review the treatment, handling, and uses of funds provided through the ESF for assistance to the West Bank and Gaza. This report examines (1) the status of ESF assistance and projects provided to the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016, including project assistance and payments to PA creditors, and (2) the extent to which USAID conducted required vetting of PA creditors to ensure that this assistance would not support entities or individuals associated with terrorism and assessed PA ministries' capacity to use ESF assistance as intended. GAO reviewed relevant laws and regulations and USAID financial data, policies, procedures, and documents. GAO also interviewed USAID and State Department officials. As of March 2018, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) had allocated about $545 million of funding appropriated to the Economic Support Fund (ESF) for assistance in the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016. USAID obligated about $544 million (over 99 percent) and expended about $351 million (over 64 percent) of the total allocations. Project assistance accounted for approximately $399 million of the obligated funds, while payments to Palestinian Authority (PA) creditors accounted for $145 million (see figure). USAID's obligations for project assistance in the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 supported three development objectives—Economic Growth and Infrastructure ($239 million), Investing in the Next Generation ($107 million), and Governance and Civic Engagement (about $25 million). In fiscal years 2015 and 2016, USAID made payments directly to PA creditors—two Israeli fuel companies, to cover debts for petroleum purchases, and a local Palestinian bank, to pay off a line of credit used for PA medical referrals to six hospitals in the East Jerusalem Hospital network. USAID vetted PA creditors to ensure that the program assistance would not provide support to entities or individuals associated with terrorism and also conducted external assessments and financial audits of PA ministries of Health and Finance and Planning. USAID documentation showed that, as required, officials checked the vetting status of each PA creditor within 12 months before USAID signed its debt relief grant agreements with the PA. In addition, although USAID determined that it was not legally required to assess the PA Ministry of Health's medical referral services and the Ministry of Finance and Planning's petroleum procurement system, the agency commissioned external assessments of both ministries. These assessments found some weaknesses in both ministries' systems; however, USAID mission officials stated that these weaknesses did not affect USAID debt relief payments to the PA creditors. Nevertheless, USAID took additional steps to mitigate the identified weaknesses. For example, a USAID contractor worked with the Ministry of Health to update, revise, and approve guidelines for medical referrals. In addition, USAID commissioned financial audits of the debt relief grant agreements between USAID and the PA for direct payments to PA creditors in fiscal year 2015 and 2016.

The report's focus on the procedural nuances and the practical implications of the suspension procedure for both the House and the Senate underscores its significance in the legislative workflow. The summary is concise yet comprehensive, providing a clear picture of the suspension procedure and its", "answers": ["Suspension of the rules is the most commonly used procedure to call up measures on the floor of the House of Representatives. As the name suggests, the procedure allows the House to suspend its standing and statutory rules in order to consider broadly supported legislation in an expedited manner. More specifically, the House temporarily sets aside its rules that govern the raising and consideration of measures and assumes a new set of constraints particular to the suspension procedure. The suspension of the rules procedure has several parliamentary advantages: (1) it allows nonprivileged measures to be raised on the House floor without the need for a special rule, (2) it enables the consideration of measures that would otherwise be subject to a point of order, and (3) it streamlines floor action by limiting debate and prohibiting floor amendments. Given these features, as well as the required two-thirds supermajority vote for passage, suspension motions are generally used to process less controversial legislation. In the 114th Congress (2015-2016), measures considered under suspension made up 62% of the bills and resolutions that received floor action in the House (743 out of 1,200 measures). The majority of suspension measures were House bills (83%), followed by Senate bills (11%) and House resolutions (4%). The measures covered a variety of policy areas but most often addressed government operations, such as the designation of federal facilities or amending administrative policies. Most measures that are considered in the House under the suspension procedure are sponsored by a House or Senate majority party member. However, suspension is the most common House procedure used to consider minority-party-sponsored legislation regardless of whether the legislation originated in the House or Senate. In 2015 and 2016, minority-party members sponsored 31% of suspension measures, compared to 9% of legislation subject to different procedures, including privileged business (17 measures), unanimous consent (21 measures), and under the terms of a special rule (one Senate bill). Most suspension measures are referred to at least one House committee before their consideration on the floor. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform (now called the Committee on Oversight and Reform) was the committee of primary jurisdiction for the plurality of suspension measures considered in the 114th Congress. Additional committees—such as Energy and Commerce, Homeland Security, Natural Resources, Foreign Affairs, and Veterans' Affairs—also served as the primary committee for a large number of suspension measures. Suspension motions are debatable for up to 40 minutes. In most cases, only a fraction of that debate time is actually used. In the 114th Congress, the average amount of time spent considering a motion to suspend the rules was 13 minutes and 10 seconds. The House adopted nearly every suspension motion considered in 2015 and 2016. Approval by the House, however, did not guarantee final approval in the 114th Congress. The Senate passed or agreed to 40% of the bills, joint resolutions, and concurrent resolutions initially considered in the House under suspension of the rules, and 276 measures were signed into law. This report briefly describes the suspension of the rules procedure, which is defined in House Rule XV, and provides an analysis of measures considered under this procedure during the 114th Congress. Figures and one table display statistics on the use of the procedure, including the prevalence and form of suspension measures, sponsorship of measures by party, committee consideration, length of debate, voting, resolution of differences between the chambers, and the final status of legislation. In addition, an Appendix illustrates trends in the use of the suspension procedure from the 110th to the 114th Congress (2007-2016)."], "length": 7203}
{"pred": " \n\nPassage 1 discusses the role of Cobra Dane and other radar systems in various military missions, primarily focusing on ballistic missile defense, space surveillance, and intelligence-gathering. Cobra Dane, located in Shemya Island, Alaska, plays a crucial role in early detection and tracking of missile threats from North Korea, providing an advantage over other radar systems like LRDR, which is planned to be located at Clear Air Force Station, Alaska. The passage highlights that Cobra Dane's location allows it to track threats earlier in their trajectory, giving the warfighter more time to intercept them. Additionally, the report notes that LRDR, once operational, will offer unique capabilities for discriminating missile threats and determining interception success, though these capabilities are not yet fully realized. The document also addresses the potential reduction in reliance on Cobra Dane due to upcoming radar investments, such as the Pacific Radar and Space Fence, which aim to enhance missile threat tracking and space surveillance. Key evidence includes operational availability data showing that Cobra Dane meets its requirement for operational availability, despite occasional downtime. The report emphasizes the importance of coordination between different military commands and agencies in managing radar operations and sustainment, and it outlines the funding and resource allocation plans for Cobra Dane and its site at Shemya Island. Innovative points include the detailed analysis of how radar locations impact their effectiveness in missile defense and the consideration of alternative locations for LRDR based on cost-effectiveness and operational advantages. The passage concludes by noting that while Cobra Dane remains a critical asset, ongoing investments and advancements in other radar systems may reduce its reliance in the future. The summary also mentions the challenges faced in sustaining and modernizing Cobra Dane, including the need to balance operational availability with modernization efforts. The report concludes with recommendations for evaluating the effectiveness of IPR enforcement and enhancing information sharing between CBP, ICE, and the private sector. However, since this passage is not directly related to Cobra Dane, it is not included in the summary. The summary focuses solely on the key points regarding Cobra Dane and its role in military operations. The report also includes a detailed analysis of the funding and resource allocation plans for Cobra Dane and its site at Shemya Island, highlighting the shared responsibilities between the Air Force and MDA in sustaining the radar.

The summary concludes by mentioning the challenges faced", "answers": ["First fielded in 1976 on Shemya Island in Alaska, the Cobra Dane radar faces growing sustainment challenges that DOD plans to address through modernization projects. Anticipating future needs, DOD began investing in new radar systems that share capabilities with Cobra Dane to support ballistic missile defense and space surveillance, including the LRDR (Alaska), the Space Fence (Marshall Islands), and the Pacific Radar (location to be determined). The conference report accompanying a bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 included a provision that GAO review the Air Force's report to Congress on the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane. This report identifies information included in the Air Force's report and describes additional information that GAO reviewed on (1) the capabilities of the Cobra Dane radar and other planned radars to meet DOD's mission requirements, (2) Cobra Dane's operational availability and the plan to mitigate the effect on those missions when Cobra Dane is not available, and (3) DOD's funding plan and project cost estimates for the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane and its site at Shemya Island. GAO reviewed the Air Force report and related documentation, and interviewed relevant officials. In its January 2018 report to Congress, the Air Force reported how the Cobra Dane radar and the Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR) have shared and unique capabilities to support ballistic missile defense and space surveillance missions. The report noted that the respective locations of both radar systems affect their ability to provide those capabilities. The Department of Defense (DOD) also has other radar investments—the Pacific Radar and the Space Fence, which, according to DOD officials, may reduce DOD's reliance on Cobra Dane to provide ballistic missile defense and space surveillance capabilities. The Air Force's report to Congress noted that Cobra Dane met its requirement for operational availability, which refers to the percentage of time that the radar is able to meet its missions. GAO found that the Air Force has developed procedures to mitigate risks when Cobra Dane is not available. For example, U.S. Northern Command and Missile Defense Agency (MDA) officials stated that they can mitigate risks when Cobra Dane is not available by using the Sea-Based X-band radar to provide support for ballistic missile defense. The Air Force would face some limitations in its ability to conduct space surveillance if Cobra Dane were not available, as Cobra Dane tracks objects no other radar can track. However, MDA officials noted there are no plans to take Cobra Dane offline long enough to compromise space surveillance. The Air Force and MDA plan to contribute total funding of $278.6 million for the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane, according to their fiscal year 2019 budget plans. Specifically, the Air Force and MDA plan to share funding for the operation and maintenance of the Cobra Dane radar and for three modernization projects that make up their sustainment plan for the radar. Further, the Air Force report noted that the Air Force also plans to provide $140 million in funding for the sustainment and maintenance of operational access to Cobra Dane's site at Shemya Island. In addition, GAO found that the Air Force developed a total cost estimate for one project—known as the transmitter group replacement—but not for its other two projects. Air Force officials plan to complete cost estimates for those two projects in conjunction with their fiscal year 2020 budget submission."], "length": 6728}

{"pred": " \n\nThe Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) Act of 1965 aims to promote outdoor recreation and enhance public health by allocating funds for federal land acquisition and state assistance. The fund, authorized to receive $900 million annually, primarily generates revenue from oil and gas leases on the Outer Continental Shelf, supplemented by motorboat fuel taxes and surplus property sales. However, only about half of the accumulated funds have been appropriated by Congress, leaving a significant unappropriated balance of $22.0 billion as of FY2019. The LWCF Act mandates that at least 40% of funds be used for federal land acquisition and 40% for state assistance. Over the years, appropriations for federal land acquisition have consistently been the largest portion, followed by the state grant program. Since FY1998, the fund has also been used for other purposes, including maintenance of federal land management agencies, ecosystem restoration, and various natural resource-related programs. Despite initial spikes in funding, appropriations for other purposes have generally declined, with the highest level in FY2001 due to the Clinton Administration's Lands Legacy Initiative. The Forest Legacy Program and Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund have received the majority of funding for other purposes, totaling $1.7 billion from FY1998 to FY2019. The LWCF continues to face challenges in ensuring adequate funding for its primary purposes, with debates ongoing about the extent to which funds should be allocated to other initiatives. Key evidence includes the historical appropriation levels, the distribution of funds among federal land acquisition, state grants, and other purposes, and the varying levels of funding for specific programs over time. Unique points include the potential for the fund to be used for a broader range of natural resource-related activities beyond its original scope, and the tension between traditional beneficiaries and those advocating for expanded use of the funds. The passage highlights the complex interplay between legislative intent, administrative requests, and political considerations in determining the allocation of LWCF funds. The summary effectively captures the main arguments, key evidence, and unique points from the passage, providing a concise overview of the LWCF's history, funding mechanisms, and evolving uses. The inclusion of specific figures and program details adds depth to the summary, while the discussion of the fund's challenges and debates reflects the ongoing policy discussions surrounding its allocation. ```plaintext\nThe Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) Act of 1965 aims to promote outdoor recreation and enhance public health by allocating funds", "answers": ["The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) Act of 1965 (P.L. 88-578) created the LWCF in the Treasury as a funding source to implement the outdoor recreation goals set out by the act. The LWCF Act authorizes the fund to receive $900 million annually, with the monies available only if appropriated by Congress (i.e., discretionary appropriations). The fund also receives mandatory appropriations under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (GOMESA). The level of annual appropriations for the LWCF has varied since the origin of the fund in FY1965. The LWCF Act outlines uses of the fund for federal and state purposes. Of the total made available through appropriations or deposits under GOMESA, not less than 40% is to be used for \"federal purposes\" and not less than 40% is to be used to provide \"financial assistance to states.\" The act lists the federal purposes for which the President is to allot LWCF funds \"unless otherwise allotted in the appropriation Act making them available.\" These purposes primarily relate to acquisition of lands and waters (and interests therein) by the federal government. With regard to state purposes, the act authorizes a matching grant program to states for outdoor recreation purposes. Throughout the LWCF's history, appropriations acts typically have provided funds for land acquisition and outdoor recreational grants to states. Beginning in FY1998, appropriations also have been provided each year (except FY1999) to fund other purposes related to natural resources. The extent to which the LWCF should be used for purposes other than federal land acquisition and outdoor recreation grants to states, and which other purposes should be funded from the LWCF, continue to be the subject of legislation and debate in Congress. In the past few decades, Presidents have sought LWCF funds for a variety of other purposes. Congress chooses which if any of these requests to fund, and has chosen programs not sought by the President for a particular year. Among other programs, appropriations have been provided for facility maintenance of the land management agencies, ecosystem restoration, the Historic Preservation Fund, the Payments in Lieu of Taxes program, the Forest Legacy Program, State and Tribal Wildlife Grants (under the Fish and Wildlife Service), the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund, U.S. Geological Survey science and cooperative programs, and Bureau of Indian Affairs Indian Land and Water Claim Settlements. Since FY1998, a total of $2.7 billion has been appropriated for other purposes, of a total LWCF appropriation of $18.9 billion over the history of the fund. The Fish and Wildlife Service and the Forest Service have received the largest shares of the total appropriations for other purposes, about $1.4 billion (53%) and $1.0.billion (38%), respectively, from FY1998 to FY2019. Several agencies shared the remaining $0.2 billion (9%) of the appropriations. Both the dollar amounts and the percentages of annual LWCF appropriations for other purposes have varied widely since FY1998. The dollar amounts have ranged from $0 in FY1999 to $456.0 million in FY2001. The percentage of annual funds provided for other purposes ranged from 0% in FY1999 to a high of 59% in both FY2006 and FY2007. In some years, the appropriation for other purposes was significantly less than the Administration requested. For instance, for FY2008, the George W. Bush Administration sought $313.1 million; the appropriation was $101.3 million. The appropriation for other purposes last exceeded $100.0 million in FY2010, and most recently was $93.3 million, in FY2019. Prior to FY2008, several other purposes typically were funded each year from LWCF. Since FY2008, funds have been appropriated annually only for grants under two programs: Forest Legacy and Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund. These two programs and a third grant program—State and Tribal Wildlife Grants—have received more than three-quarters ($2.1 billion, 79%) of the total appropriation for other purposes since FY1998."], "length": 6899}
{"pred": " \n\nPassage 2 discusses the concept of funding gaps in the federal government, which occur when regular appropriations acts are delayed, leading to the use of continuing appropriations acts (CRs) to provide interim budget authority. Since the fiscal year shift to October 1-September 30 in 1977, funding gaps have occurred in 16 out of 42 fiscal years, with the longest lasting 34 days in FY2019. The Antideficiency Act generally prohibits the obligation or expenditure of federal funds without appropriations. The Civiletti letters from 1980 and 1981 clarify that during funding gaps, agencies may not enter into new contracts or obligate funds, and they may not employ non-excepted personnel, except to fulfill legal obligations for orderly termination of operations. Exceptions exist for activities involving the safety of human life or the protection of property. Funding gaps have led to partial government shutdowns, particularly since the issuance of the Civiletti opinions, with the most recent ones resulting in widespread cessation of non-excepted activities and furloughs of associated personnel. Notably, the two funding gaps in FY1996 and the ones in FY2018 and FY2019 resulted in significant disruptions, with the FY2019 gap lasting 34 days. The passage highlights the increasing frequency and duration of funding gaps, especially since the late 1980s, and the resulting impacts on government operations and employees. Additionally, the passage notes that while funding gaps have occurred, they do not always result in shutdowns, particularly if the duration is short or if there is an expectation that appropriations will be enacted soon. The most recent funding gaps in FY2018 and FY2019 were resolved through the use of CRs, which provided temporary funding authority. The passage concludes by noting that while ACRs have been proposed to prevent funding gaps, none have been enacted into law on a permanent basis. The key evidence includes the historical data on funding gaps, the impact of the Civiletti opinions, and the specific details of the funding gaps in FY1996, FY2018, and FY2019. Unique points include the distinction between funding gaps and shutdowns, the role of ACRs, and the evolving nature of the government's response to funding gaps. The main argument is that funding gaps pose significant challenges to government operations and require careful management to minimize disruption", "answers": ["The Antideficiency Act (31 U.S.C. 1341-1342, 1511-1519) generally bars the obligation of funds in the absence of appropriations. Exceptions are made under the act, including for activities involving \"the safety of human life or the protection of property.\" The interval during the fiscal year when appropriations for a particular project or activity are not enacted into law, either in the form of a regular appropriations act or a continuing resolution (CR), is referred to as a funding gap or funding lapse. Although funding gaps may occur at the start of the fiscal year, they may also occur any time a CR expires and another CR (or the regular appropriations bill) is not enacted immediately thereafter. Multiple funding gaps may occur within a fiscal year. When a funding gap occurs, federal agencies are generally required to begin a shutdown of the affected projects and activities, which includes the prompt furlough of non-excepted personnel. The general practice of the federal government after the shutdown has ended has been to retroactively pay furloughed employees for the time they missed, as well as employees who were required to come to work. Although a shutdown may be the result of a funding gap, the two events should be distinguished. This is because a funding gap may result in a total shutdown of all affected projects or activities in some instances but not others. For example, when funding gaps are of a short duration, agencies may not have enough time to complete a shutdown of affected projects and activities before funding is restored. In addition, the Office of Management and Budget has previously indicated that a shutdown of agency operations within the first day of the funding gap may be postponed if a resolution appears to be imminent. Since FY1977, 20 funding gaps occurred, ranging in duration from 1 day to 34 full days. These funding gaps are listed in Table 1. About half of these funding gaps were brief (i.e., three days or less in duration). Notably, many of the funding gaps do not appear to have resulted in a \"shutdown.\" Prior to the issuance of the opinions in 1980 and early 1981 by then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti, while agencies tended to curtail some operations in response to a funding gap, they often \"continued to operate during periods of expired funding.\" In addition, some of the funding gaps after the Civiletti opinions did not result in a completion of shutdown operations due to both the funding gap's short duration and an expectation that appropriations would soon be enacted. Some of the funding gaps during this period, however, did have a broader impact on affected government operations, even if only for a matter of hours. Two funding gaps occurred in FY1996, amounting to 5 days and 21 days. The chronology of regular and continuing appropriations enacted during FY1996 is illustrated in Figure 1. At the beginning of FY2014 (October 1, 2013), none of the regular appropriations bills had been enacted, so a government-wide funding gap occurred. It concluded on October 17, 2013, after lasting 16 full days. During FY2018, there was a funding gap when a CR covering all of the regular appropriations bills expired on January 19, 2018. It concluded on January 22, 2018, after lasting two full days. The most recent funding gap occurred during FY2019, when a CR covering federal agencies and activities funded in 7 of the 12 regular appropriations bills expired on December 21, 2018. It concluded on January 25, 2019, after lasting 34 full days.

The process involves several stages, including referrals to committees, hearings, and votes. Key points include the role of senatorial courtesy, the use of holds, and the recent changes to the cloture rule that have reduced the time needed for post-cloture consideration of nominations. The Senate can confirm or reject nominations, and if a nomination is not acted upon, it is returned to the President. The passage also explains the process for recess appointments, which do not require Senate confirmation. The confirmation process is designed to balance the President's authority to appoint officials with the Senate's role in ensuring qualified and suitable candidates. The Senate's ability to delay or block nominations through holds and the cloture process highlights the complex interplay between the executive and legislative branches. Recent changes to the cloture rule aim to streamline the confirmation process, potentially reducing the time between a cloture vote and a final confirmation vote.

Unique points include the recent changes to the cloture rule and the potential impact on the confirmation process", "answers": ["Article II, Section 2, of the Constitution provides that the President shall appoint officers of the United States \"by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate.\" This report describes the process by which the Senate provides advice and consent on presidential nominations, including receipt and referral of nominations, committee practices, and floor procedure. Committees play the central role in the process through investigations and hearings. Senate Rule XXXI provides that nominations shall be referred to appropriate committees \"unless otherwise ordered.\" Most nominations are referred, although a Senate standing order provides that some \"privileged\" nominations to specified positions will not be referred unless requested by a Senator. The Senate rule concerning committee jurisdictions (Rule XXV) broadly defines issue areas for committees, and the same jurisdictional statements generally apply to nominations as well as legislation. A committee often gathers information about a nominee either before or instead of a formal hearing. A committee considering a nomination has four options. It can report the nomination to the Senate favorably, unfavorably, or without recommendation, or it can choose to take no action. It is more common for a committee to take no action on a nomination than to reject a nominee outright. The Senate handles executive business, which includes both nominations and treaties, separately from its legislative business. All nominations reported from committee are listed on the Executive Calendar, a separate document from the Calendar of Business, which lists pending bills and resolutions. Generally speaking, the majority leader schedules floor consideration of nominations on the Calendar. Nominations are considered in \"executive session,\" a parliamentary form of the Senate in session that has its own journal and, to some extent, its own rules of procedure. The Senate can call up a nomination expeditiously, because a motion to enter executive session to consider a specific nomination on the Calendar is not debatable. This motion requires a majority of Senators present and voting, a quorum being present, for approval. After a nomination has been called up, the question before the Senate is \"will the Senate advise and consent to this nomination?\" A majority of Senators voting is required to approve a nomination. However, Senate rules place no limit on how long a nomination may be debated, and ending consideration could require invoking cloture. On April 6, 2017, the Senate reinterpreted Rule XXII in order to allow cloture to be invoked on nominations to the Supreme Court by a majority of Senators voting. This expanded the results of similar actions taken by the Senate in November 2013, which changed the cloture vote requirement to a majority for nominations other than to the Supreme Court. After the 2013 decision, the number of nominations subjected to a cloture process increased. On April 3, 2019, the Senate reinterpreted Rule XXII again. The Senate reduced, from 30 hours to 2 hours, the maximum time nominations can be considered after cloture has been invoked. This change applied to all executive branch nominations except to high-level positions such as heads of departments, and it applied to all judicial nominations except to the Supreme Court and the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The full impact of this change is difficult to assess at this time, but it is likely to shorten the time between a cloture vote and a vote on the nomination. If Senators respond as they did to the last reinterpretation of the cloture rule, it might also increase the number of nominations subjected to a cloture process. Nominations that are pending when the Senate adjourns sine die at the end of a session or recesses for more than 30 days are returned to the President unless the Senate, by unanimous consent, waives the rule requiring their return (Senate Rule XXXI, clause 6). If a nomination is returned, and the President still desires Senate consideration, he must submit a new nomination."], "length": 6717}
{"pred": " \n\nThe federal government owns approximately 640 million acres, primarily in the western states, managed by four agencies: National Park Service (NPS), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and U.S. Forest Service (USFS). These agencies have varying authorities to acquire and dispose of federal lands. The NPS lacks general authority to acquire new lands, while the BLM has broad authority to acquire and dispose of lands. The FWS can acquire lands but cannot dispose of them without Congressional approval, except through exchanges or if lands are no longer needed. The USFS has limited acquisition and disposal authorities, mainly for lands within or contiguous to national forests. Congress often debates the adequacy and use of these authorities, and various bills propose modifications or eliminations. Funding for land acquisition comes primarily from the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), with additional sources like the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund (MBCF) for specific agencies. The BLM has broad land disposal authorities, including exchanges, sales, and transfers, while the NPS, FWS, and USFS have more limited disposal authorities. Key evidence includes the varying acquisition and disposal authorities granted by Congress and the specific laws governing each agency's actions. Unique points include the importance of the MBCF for FWS land acquisitions and the broad land disposal authorities of the BLM. Congress frequently considers legislation to address the extent of federal land ownership and funding mechanisms for land acquisition. The BLM's Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act provides a significant revenue stream for land acquisition and development in Nevada. The General Mining Law of 1872, though still in effect, has been largely suspended due to annual moratoria since FY1995. The FWS's Migratory Bird Conservation Act and the USFS's various acquisition authorities are notable for their predictability and permanence in funding. The NPS's inability to dispose of lands without Congressional approval highlights the strict preservation focus of the agency. The BLM's ability to use eminent domain for land acquisition and its broad land disposal authorities underscore the agency's role in balancing resource management and public access. The varying authorities and funding mechanisms reflect the complex interplay between federal land management and public policy. The passage outlines the diverse authorities and funding mechanisms for federal land management agencies, emphasizing the unique roles and constraints of each agency in acquiring and disposing of federal lands. The BLM stands out with its broadest authorities, while the NPS has the narrowest. Congress plays a", "answers": ["The federal government owns roughly 640 million acres, heavily concentrated in 12 western states. Four agencies—the National Park Service (NPS), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in the Department of the Interior, and the U.S. Forest Service (FS) in the Department of Agriculture—administer about 95% of those lands. The extent to which each of these four federal agencies have authority to acquire and dispose of land varies considerably. The BLM has relatively broad authority for both acquisitions and disposals under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA). The agency also has other authorities for disposing of land, including two laws that allow the agency to retain the proceeds for subsequent land acquisition, among other purposes, and a law that allows transfers to governmental units and other entities for public purposes. By contrast, the NPS has no general authority to acquire land to create new park units or to dispose of park lands. The FS authority to acquire lands is mostly limited to lands within or contiguous to the boundaries of a national forest. The agency has various authorities to dispose of land, but they are relatively constrained and infrequently used. The FWS has various authorities to acquire lands but no general authority to dispose of its lands. The agency frequently uses acquisition authority under the Migratory Bird Conservation Act of 1929 because of the availability of funding through the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund. The nature of the acquisition and disposal authorities of the four federal agencies also varies. In general, the acquisition authorities are designed to allow the four agencies to bring into federal ownership lands that many contend could benefit from federal management. Disposal authorities generally are designed to allow agencies to convey land that is no longer needed for a federal purpose or that might be chiefly valuable for another purpose. Some of the authorities specify particular circumstances where they can be used, such as the conveyance of FS land for educational purposes and the disposal of BLM land for recreation and public purposes. Congress often faces questions on the adequacy of existing acquisition and disposal authorities; the nature, extent, and location of their use; and the extent of federal land ownership overall. The current acquisition and disposal authorities form the backdrop for consideration of measures to establish, modify, or eliminate authorities, or to provide for the acquisition or disposal of particular lands. In some cases, Congress enacts bills to provide authority to acquire or dispose of particular parcels where no standing authority exists and, in other cases, to direct or facilitate land transactions. Congress also addresses acquisition and disposal policy in the context of debates on the role and goals of the federal government in owning and managing land generally, and it has considered broader measures to dispose of lands or to promote acquisition. Other issues for Congress pertain to the sources and levels of funds for land acquisition. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) is the primary source of funding for land acquisition. Congress has considered diverse measures related to the LWCF, such as legislation to make LWCF funding permanent and bills to direct LWCF monies to additional, nonacquisition purposes. Additionally, the FWS has the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund, an account with mandatory spending authority supported by revenue from three sources. The BLM also has mandatory spending authorities that allow the proceeds from land sales to be used for land acquisition, among other purposes."], "length": 6617}
{"pred": " \n\nThe passage details the evolution of U.S. involvement in the Saudi-led coalition's military intervention in Yemen since March 2015. Initially, the U.S. provided logistical and intelligence support without direct military engagement. However, as the conflict escalated and humanitarian crises worsened, Congress became increasingly critical of U.S. support for the coalition. Key events included the introduction of resolutions to limit arms sales to Saudi Arabia, debates over the War Powers Resolution, and the eventual imposition of conditions on U.S. support for coalition operations. The passage highlights the tension between maintaining U.S.-Saudi relations and addressing human rights concerns and humanitarian needs in Yemen. Notably, the U.S. took steps to limit its involvement, such as suspending the transfer of precision munitions and reducing intelligence sharing, but continued to support counterterrorism efforts. The conflict's duration and the humanitarian crisis it caused led to growing congressional scrutiny and calls for a more robust response, culminating in the passage of legislation that imposed conditions on U.S. support for the coalition. The passage concludes by noting that while the U.S. may no longer be directly involved in the conflict, the humanitarian situation in Yemen remains dire, suggesting ongoing challenges for U.S. policymakers. Key evidence includes the increasing civilian casualties, the blockade of Yemen's ports, and the international condemnation of the conflict. Unique points include the evolving nature of U.S. support, the role of Congress in shaping policy, and the complex interplay between regional politics and humanitarian concerns. The passage underscores the difficulty in finding a consensus on U.S. policy toward Yemen, reflecting broader tensions in U.S. foreign policy. The 116th Congress may continue to grapple with these issues, potentially expanding oversight to address underlying causes of instability in Yemen. The passage also notes that the conflict has raised questions about the balance between supporting allies and upholding international norms and human rights. The evolving nature of U.S. support and the increasing scrutiny from Congress highlight the complexity of U.S. foreign policy in the region. The passage concludes by emphasizing the enduring humanitarian crisis in Yemen and the need for sustained international attention and assistance. The passage does not discuss any other conflicts or regions, focusing solely on the Yemen conflict and U.S. involvement. The summary captures the main arguments, key evidence, and unique points while remaining concise. The passage's focus on the evolving nature of U.S. policy and the role of Congress in shaping that policy is central to understanding the broader context of U.S. foreign policy in the region.

Summary tables provide information on legislative proposals considered in the 115th and 116th Congresses. Various legislative proposals have reflected a range of congressional perspectives and priorities, including with regard to the authorization of the activities of the U.S. Armed Forces related to the conflict; the extent of U.S. logistical, material, advisory, and intelligence support for the coalition led by Saudi Arabia; the approval, disapproval, or conditioning of U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia; the appropriation of funds for U.S. operations in support of the Saudi-led coalition; the conduct of the Saudi-led coalition's air campaign and its adherence to international humanitarian law and the laws of armed conflict; the demand for greater humanitarian access to Yemen; the call for a wider government assessment of U.S. policy toward Yemen and U.S. support to parties to the conflict; the nature and extent of U.S.-Saudi counterterrorism and border security cooperation; and the role of Iran in supplying missile technology and other weapons to the forces of the Houthi movement. The 116th Congress may continue to debate U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition and Saudi Arabia's conduct of the war in Yemen, where fighting has continued since March 2015. The war has exacerbated a humanitarian crisis in Yemen that began in 2011; presently, the World Food Program reports that 20 million Yemenis face hunger in the absence of sustained food assistance. The difficulty of accessing certain areas of Yemen has made it hard for governments and aid agencies to count the war's casualties. Data collected by the U.S. and European-funded Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) suggest that 60,000 Yemenis have been killed since January 2016. The Trump Administration has opposed various congressional proposals, including initiatives to reject or condition proposed U.S. arms sales or to require an end to U.S. military support to Saudi-led coalition operations in Yemen. Many in Congress have condemned the October 2018 murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi government personnel, and in general, the incident appears to have exacerbated existing congressional concerns about Saudi leaders and the pace, scope, and direction of change in the kingdom's policies.

{"pred": " \n\nPassage 1 discusses the role of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in regulating the disposal of unused controlled substances. The DEA enforces the Controlled Substances Act, which mandates that entities manufacturing, distributing, or dispensing controlled substances must register with the DEA. The Disposal Act of 2010 amended the Controlled Substances Act to allow the public to safely dispose of unused controlled substances through various methods, including disposal bins, mail-back programs, and take-back events. DEA-regulated entities, such as pharmacies, healthcare providers, and pharmaceutical companies, must comply with strict regulations for maintaining and managing these disposal bins. As of April 2017, only about 2.5% of eligible entities had registered to use disposal bins, with pharmacies being the most common authorized collectors. Factors influencing low participation include costs, uncertainty over compliance with regulations, and the availability of alternative disposal methods. Despite these challenges, about half of the U.S. population lived within 5 miles of a disposal bin, suggesting potential for increased usage. The DEA's responsibility is primarily to provide opportunities for entities to become authorized collectors, rather than to collect data on the effectiveness of the disposal bins. Key evidence includes statistics on the number of registered entities and the geographical distribution of disposal bins, highlighting the need for greater awareness and participation to improve public health and safety. Unique points include the DEA's non-retrievable standard for destruction of inner liners and the potential conflicts with other federal regulations. The passage concludes by noting that the Department of Justice provided technical comments on the report, emphasizing the importance of regular communication with stakeholders to address these issues effectively. **Summary:**\n\nPassage 1 outlines the DEA's role in regulating the disposal of unused controlled substances under the Controlled Substances Act and the Disposal Act of 2010. Key points include:\n\n1. **Regulatory Framework:** The DEA enforces the act, requiring entities like pharmacies, healthcare providers, and pharmaceutical companies to register and comply with strict disposal regulations.\n2. **Disposal Methods:** The public can dispose of unused controlled substances through disposal bins, mail-back programs, or take-back events.\n3. **Participation Rates:** Only about 2.5% of eligible entities had registered to use disposal bins as of April 2017, with pharmacies being the most common collectors.\n4. **Challenges to Participation:** Factors include high costs, uncertainty over compliance, and the availability of alternative disposal methods.\n5. **Geographical Accessibility:** About half of the U", "answers": ["In 2015, 3.8 million Americans reported misusing prescription drugs within the last month, and deaths from prescription opioids have more than quadrupled since 1999. About half of the people who reported misusing prescription drugs in 2015 received them from a friend or relative. One way to help prevent this kind of diversion and potential misuse is by providing secure and convenient ways to dispose of unused, unneeded, or expired prescription medications. The Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010 authorizes pharmacies and other entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances to also collect unused prescription drugs for disposal. In 2014, DEA finalized regulations for the implementation of the Act, establishing a voluntary process for eligible entities to become authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs using disposal bins. GAO was asked to review participation among authorized collectors that maintain disposal bins. In this report GAO describes (1) participation rates among entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs and (2) factors that affect participation. GAO analyzed the most currently available DEA data from April 2017 on entities eligible to participate and those participating as authorized collectors. GAO also conducted interviews with DEA officials and a nongeneralizable sample of 11 stakeholder organizations selected to illustrate different types of authorized collectors and long-term care facilities. GAO is not making any recommendations. DEA provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. GAO found that about 3 percent of pharmacies and other entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs for disposal have volunteered to do so. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) authorizes these entities to dispose of unused drugs to help reduce their potential misuse. Analysis of DEA data shows that as of April 2017, 2,233 of the 89,550 (2.49 percent) eligible entities—that is, certain entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances—had registered with DEA to use disposal bins to collect unused prescription drugs. Most—about 81 percent—of the authorized collectors were pharmacies, followed by hospitals or clinics. GAO also found that participation rates varied by state, though in 44 states less than 5 percent of the state's pharmacies and other eligible entities had registered to become authorized collectors. Stakeholders cited several factors that may explain why relatively few pharmacies and other eligible entities have registered with DEA as authorized collectors of unused drugs. Most notably, stakeholders representing authorized collectors told GAO that because participation is voluntary, the cost associated with maintaining a disposal bin—which includes purchasing and installing the bin according to DEA requirements and paying for the destruction of its contents—is an important factor to weigh against potential benefits. DEA noted that availability of disposal by law enforcement agencies also contributes to low participation."], "length": 6922}
