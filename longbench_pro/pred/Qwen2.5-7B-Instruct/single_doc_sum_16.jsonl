{"pred": " \n\nPassage 2 discusses the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA), which provides workers' compensation coverage for private-sector employees engaged in longshore, harbor, or other maritime occupations on or adjacent to the navigable waters of the United States. The LHWCA is administered by the Department of Labor (DOL) but benefits are typically paid through private insurers or self-insured firms. The act ensures medical and disability benefits for covered workers and provides survivors' benefits to the families of deceased workers. The LHWCA covers most maritime employees except for those excluded by statute, such as masters and crew members of vessels, and employees of the federal government. The act has been amended to extend coverage to additional occupations, including military and public works contractors, civilian employees of nonappropriated fund instrumentalities, and workers on the Outer Continental Shelf. The LHWCA provides comprehensive medical benefits, disability benefits based on pre-disability wages, and survivors' benefits. The DOL oversees the claims process, and disputes are resolved through informal conferences, administrative law judges, the Benefits Review Board, and the U.S. Court of Appeals. The LHWCA is funded through an annual assessment on employers and insurance carriers, and the DOL uses general revenue to cover administrative costs. Unique points include the fact that the LHWCA provides more generous benefits than state workers' compensation systems and that the act's scope has been expanded over time to cover additional occupations. Additionally, the LHWCA benefits are not subject to federal income tax, unlike most state workers' compensation benefits. The act's funding structure and dispute resolution process are also noteworthy. The passage highlights the comprehensive nature of the LHWCA and its role in ensuring workers' rights and benefits in the maritime industry. The LHWCA's funding and dispute resolution mechanisms are critical components of its effectiveness. The act's amendments and the inclusion of more occupations demonstrate its adaptability to changing labor market needs. The LHWCA's unique benefits and funding structure set it apart from state workers' compensation systems. The passage emphasizes the importance of the LHWCA in providing comprehensive coverage and support for maritime workers and their families. The act's adaptability and the provision of more generous benefits than state systems highlight its significance in the maritime industry. The funding and dispute resolution processes are crucial for the act's successful implementation. The LHWCA's comprehensive coverage, unique benefits, and adaptability to changing labor market needs are key aspects of its importance in the maritime industry. The act's funding and dispute resolution mechanisms", "answers": ["The Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA) is a federal workers' compensation program that covers certain private-sector maritime workers. Firms that employ these workers are required to purchase workers' compensation or self-insure and are responsible for providing medical and disability benefits to covered workers who are injured or become ill on the job and survivors benefits to the families of covered workers who die on the job. The LHWCA is administered by the Department of Labor (DOL), and all benefit costs are paid by employers and their insurance carriers. In 2016, more than $1.4 billion in LHWCA benefits were paid to beneficiaries. Congress has extended the LHWCA provisions to cover workers outside of the maritime industry, such as overseas government contractors and civilian employees of military post exchanges. As part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), persons who repair recreational vessels of any size were added to the LHWCA exemption list. In 2011, the DOL implemented this provision; since then, those regulations have proven controversial and numerous bills have been introduced to modify the regulatory definition to increase the number of workers exempted from the LHWCA. The LHWCA pays for all medical care associated with a covered injury or illness. Disability benefits are based on a worker's pre-injury wage, and, unlike comparable state workers' compensation benefits, are adjusted annually to reflect national wage growth."], "length": 13180}

These capabilities make attack submarines some of the most–requested assets by the global combatant commanders. GAO was asked to review the readiness of the Navy's attack submarine force. This report discusses the extent to which the Navy (1) has experienced maintenance delays in its attack submarine fleet and costs associated with any delays; and (2) has addressed any challenges and developed mitigation plans for any maintenance delays. GAO analyzed readiness information from fiscal years 2008-2018, operating and support costs, maintenance performance, and other data; visited attack submarines and squadrons; and interviewed public and private shipyard and fleet officials. This is a public version of a classified report issued in October 2018. Information the Department of Defense deemed classified or sensitive, such as attack submarine force structure requirements and detailed data on attack submarine maintenance delays, has been omitted. The Navy has been unable to begin or complete the vast majority of its attack submarine maintenance periods on time resulting in significant maintenance delays and operating and support cost expenditures. GAO's analysis of Navy maintenance data shows that between fiscal year 2008 and 2018, attack submarines have incurred 10,363 days of idle time and maintenance delays as a result of delays in getting into and out of the shipyards. For example, the Navy originally scheduled the USS Boise to enter a shipyard for an extended maintenance period in 2013 but, due to heavy shipyard workload, the Navy delayed the start of the maintenance period. In June 2016, the USS Boise could no longer conduct normal operations and the boat has remained idle, pierside for over two years since then waiting to enter a shipyard (see figure). GAO estimated that since fiscal year 2008 the Navy has spent more than $1.5 billion in fiscal year 2018 constant dollars to support attack submarines that provide no operational capability—those sitting idle while waiting to enter the shipyards, and those delayed in completing their maintenance at the shipyards. The Navy has started to address challenges related to workforce shortages and facilities needs at the public shipyards. However, it has not effectively allocated maintenance periods among public shipyards and private shipyards that may also be available to help minimize attack submarine idle time. GAO's analysis found that while the public shipyards have operated above capacity for the past several years, attack submarine maintenance delays are getting longer and idle time is increasing. The Navy may have options to mitigate this idle time and maintenance delays by leveraging private shipyard capacity for repair work. But the Navy has not completed a comprehensive business case analysis as recommended by Department of Defense guidelines to inform maintenance workload allocation across public and private shipyards. Navy leadership has acknowledged that they need to be more proactive in leveraging potential private shipyard repair capacity. Without addressing this challenge, the Navy risks continued expenditure of operating and support funding to crew, maintain, and support attack submarines that provide no operational capability because they are delayed in getting into and out of maintenance. GAO recommends that the Navy conduct a business case analysis to inform maintenance workload allocation across public and private shipyards.

This methodology allowed GAO to generalize to the population of 45,818 disclosure reports with $5,000 or more in lobbying activity, and 30,594 reports of federal political campaign contributions. GAO also met with officials from USAO to obtain status updates on its efforts to focus resources on lobbyists who fail to comply. GAO is not making any recommendations in this report. GAO provided a draft of this report to the Department of Justice for review and comment. The Department of Justice provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. For the 2017 reporting period, most lobbyists provided documentation for key elements of their disclosure reports to demonstrate compliance with the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995, as amended (LDA). For lobbying disclosure (LD-2) reports and political contributions (LD-203) reports filed during the third and fourth quarter of 2016 and the first and second quarter of 2017, GAO estimates that 87 percent of lobbyists filed reports as required for the quarter in which they first registered; the figure below describes the filing process and enforcement; 99 percent of all lobbyists who filed (up from 83 percent in 2016) could provide documentation for income and expenses; and 93 percent filed year-end 2016 LD-203 reports as required. These findings are generally consistent with prior reports GAO issued for the 2010 through 2016 reporting periods. However, in recent years GAO's findings showed some variation in the estimated percentage of reports with supporting documentation. For example, an estimated increase in lobbyists who could document expenses is notable in 2017 and represents a statistically significant increase from 2016. As in GAO's other reports, some lobbyists were still unclear about the need to disclose certain previously held covered positions, such as paid congressional internships or certain executive agency positions. GAO estimates that 15 percent of all LD-2 reports may not have properly disclosed previously held covered positions. On the other hand, over the past several years of reporting on lobbying disclosure, GAO found that most lobbyists in the sample rated the terms associated with LD-2 reporting as “very easy” or “somewhat easy” to understand. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia (USAO) stated it has sufficient resources and authority to enforce compliance with the LDA. USAO continued its efforts to bring lobbyists into compliance by reminding them to file reports or by applying civil penalties."], "length": 13207}
{"pred": " \n\nThe passage provides an extensive overview of the U.S. Navy's ship-naming process, tracing its evolution from the 19th century to contemporary practices. Key points include:\n\n1. The Secretary of the Navy traditionally has the authority to name new ships, although the exact legal basis has shifted over time. Current practices involve a complex process involving research, recommendations from various sources, and ultimately the Secretary's decision.\n\n2. Ship names are chosen based on a mix of historical, geographical, and personal criteria. For example, states, cities, battles, and naval heroes are common sources. Exceptions to standard naming conventions are made for significant figures like presidents and members of Congress.\n\n3. The process of naming ships has evolved over time, adapting to changes in naval technology and priorities. For instance, the naming of submarines has shifted from fish to states.\n\n4. The Navy has faced challenges in maintaining a steady supply of names for certain ship types, particularly for Virginia-class submarines and aircraft carriers. This has led to debates about whether to amend naming rules or make exceptions.\n\n5. The passage notes that naming ships for living individuals has become more common in recent decades, reflecting a return to practices from the early days of the U.S. Navy.\n\n6. The report concludes that current naming practices align with historical traditions and are effective, arguing against the establishment of rigid, fixed policies for ship naming. Instead, it recommends continued flexibility to address evolving needs and priorities. The Navy plans to publish updated guidelines to enhance transparency and understanding of the naming process. The report also highlights the importance of balancing historical continuity with the need to honor contemporary heroes and contributions. The evolving nature of ship naming reflects the dynamic character of the U.S. Navy and its changing missions and technologies over time. The passage underscores the complexity and significance of the ship-naming process, which involves a blend of tradition, practical considerations, and political influence. Key evidence includes historical examples, current practices, and the Navy's own analysis of the naming process. The report's recommendation against fixed policies reflects a nuanced understanding of the challenges and opportunities in maintaining a flexible yet coherent naming system. The inclusion of transparency measures, such as publishing updated naming guidelines, aims to foster greater public understanding and engagement with this important aspect of naval heritage. The evolving nature of ship naming, particularly in relation to new technologies and changing societal values, highlights the ongoing relevance of this practice in shaping the identity and legacy of the U.S. Navy. The passage emphasizes the importance of balancing historical continuity with the need to honor contemporary figures and contributions", "answers": ["Names for Navy ships traditionally have been chosen and announced by the Secretary of the Navy, under the direction of the President and in accordance with rules prescribed by Congress. Rules for giving certain types of names to certain types of Navy ships have evolved over time. There have been exceptions to the Navy's ship-naming rules, particularly for the purpose of naming a ship for a person when the rule for that type of ship would have called for it to be named for something else. Some observers have perceived a breakdown in, or corruption of, the rules for naming Navy ships. On July 13, 2012, the Navy submitted to Congress a 73-page report on the Navy's policies and practices for naming ships. For ship types now being procured for the Navy, or recently procured for the Navy, naming rules can be summarized as follows: The first Ohio replacement ballistic missile submarine (SSBN-826) has been named Columbia in honor of the District of Columbia, but the Navy has not stated what the naming rule for these ships will be. Virginia (SSN-774) class attack submarines are being named for states. Aircraft carriers are generally named for past U.S. Presidents. Of the past 14, 10 were named for past U.S. Presidents, and 2 for Members of Congress. Destroyers are being named for deceased members of the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, including Secretaries of the Navy. The Navy has not yet announced a naming rule for its planned new class of FFG(X) frigates, the first of which the Navy wants to procure in FY2021. Previous classes of U.S. Navy frigates, like Navy destroyers, were generally named for naval leaders and heroes. Littoral Combat Ships (LCSs) are being named for regionally important U.S. cities and communities. Amphibious assault ships are being named for important battles in which U.S. Marines played a prominent part, and for famous earlier U.S. Navy ships that were not named for battles. San Antonio (LPD-17) class amphibious ships are being named for major U.S. cities and communities, and cities and communities attacked on September 11, 2001. John Lewis (TAO-205) class oilers are being named for people who fought for civil rights and human rights. Expeditionary Fast Transports (EPFs) are being named for small U.S. cities. Expeditionary Transport Docks (ESDs) and Expeditionary Sea Bases (ESBs) are being named for famous names or places of historical significance to U.S. Marines. Navajo (TATS-6) class towing, salvage, and rescue ships are being named for prominent Native Americans or Native American tribes. Since 1974, at least 21 U.S. military ships have been named for persons who were living at the time the name was announced. The most recent instance occurred on May 6, 2019, when the Navy announced that it was naming the destroyer DDG-51 for former Senator Sam Nunn. Members of the public are sometimes interested in having Navy ships named for their own states or cities, for older U.S. Navy ships (particularly those on which they or their relatives served), for battles in which they or their relatives participated, or for people they admire. Congress has long maintained an interest in how Navy ships are named, and has influenced the naming of certain Navy ships. The Navy suggests that congressional offices wishing to express support for proposals to name a Navy ship for a specific person, place, or thing contact the office of the Secretary of the Navy to make their support known. Congress may also pass legislation relating to ship names. Measures passed by Congress in recent years regarding Navy ship names have all been sense-of-the-Congress provisions."], "length": 14144}
{"pred": " \n\nThe passage discusses the process and oversight of Medicaid expenditures reported by states to CMS. States are required to report expenditures quarterly on the CMS-64 form, with adjustments allowed within a 2-year filing limit. CMS reviews these reports to ensure they are supported and allowable, using both quarterly reviews and focused financial management reviews (FMRs). CMS identified errors and compliance issues through these reviews, resulting in deferrals, reductions in reported expenditures, and disallowances. However, CMS faces resource allocation challenges, with similar staff resources allocated to states of varying sizes and risk levels. Additionally, CMS's procedures for variance analyses and sampling reviews of Medicaid expansion expenditures were inconsistent and did not adequately account for risk factors. The passage concludes with three recommendations for CMS to improve its oversight of Medicaid expenditures: conducting a comprehensive risk assessment, clarifying guidance on variance analyses, and revising the sampling methodology for Medicaid expansion expenditures. Key evidence includes the decline in dedicated staff and the increase in federal Medicaid expenditures, highlighting the need for improved oversight. Unique points include the emphasis on the importance of accurate and consistent expenditure reporting to prevent federal funds from being provided at higher matching rates than allowable. The passage also highlights the financial significance of errors resolved by CMS, with over $5 billion in savings in the last four years. The inconsistency in reviews and the lack of consideration for risk factors in the sampling methodology contribute to the potential for undetected errors. The recommendations aim to address these issues and improve the accuracy and consistency of Medicaid expenditure reporting.

CMS is responsible for assuring that expenditures—reported quarterly by states—are consistent with Medicaid requirements and matched with the correct amount of federal funds. CMS's review of reported expenditures has become increasingly complex due to variation in states' Medicaid programs and an increasing number of different matching rates. GAO was asked to examine CMS's oversight of state-reported Medicaid expenditures. In this report, GAO examined how CMS assures that (1) expenditures are supported and consistent with requirements; and (2) the correct federal matching rates were applied to expenditures subject to a higher match. GAO also examined the financial impact of resolved errors. GAO reviewed documentation for the most recently completed quarterly reviews by 3 of CMS's 10 regional offices for six states that varied by Medicaid program expenditures and design. GAO also reviewed policies, procedures, and data on resolved errors; and interviewed CMS and state officials. GAO assessed CMS's oversight processes against federal standards for internal control. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), which oversees Medicaid, has various review processes in place to assure that expenditures reported by states are supported and consistent with Medicaid requirements. The agency also has processes to review that the correct federal matching rates were applied to expenditures receiving a higher than standard federal matching rate, which can include certain types of services and populations. These processes collectively have had a considerable federal financial benefit, with CMS resolving errors that reduced federal spending by over $5.1 billion in fiscal years 2014 through 2017. However, GAO identified weaknesses in how CMS targets its resources to address risks when reviewing whether expenditures are supported and consistent with requirements. CMS devotes similar levels of staff resources to review expenditures despite differing levels of risk across states. For example, the number of staff reviewing California's expenditures—which represent 15 percent of federal Medicaid spending—is similar to the number reviewing Arkansas' expenditures, which represents 1 percent of federal Medicaid spending. CMS cancelled in-depth financial management reviews in 17 out of 51 instances over the last 5 years. These reviews target expenditures considered by CMS to be at risk of not meeting program requirements. CMS told GAO that resource constraints contributed to both weaknesses. However, the agency has not completed a comprehensive assessment of risk to (1) determine whether oversight resources are adequate and (2) focus on the most significant areas of risk. Absent such an assessment, CMS is missing an opportunity to identify errors in reported expenditures that could result in substantial savings to the Medicaid program. GAO also found limitations in CMS's processes for reviewing expenditures that receive a higher federal matching rate. Internal guidance for examining variances in these expenditures was unclear, and not all reviewers in the three CMS regional offices GAO reviewed were investigating significant variances in quarter-to-quarter expenditures. Review procedures for expenditures for individuals newly eligible for Medicaid under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act were not tailored to different risk levels among states. For example, in its reviews of a sample of claims for this population, CMS reviewed claims for the same number of enrollees—30—in California as for Arkansas, even though California had 10 times the number of newly eligible enrollees as Arkansas. Without clear internal guidance and better targeting of risks in its review procedures for expenditures receiving higher matching rates, CMS may overpay states. GAO is making three recommendations, including that CMS improve its risk-based targeting of oversight efforts and resources, and clarify related internal guidance. The Department of Health and Human Services concurred with these recommendations."], "length": 12872}

The fund receives $900 million annually from oil and gas leases on the Outer Continental Shelf, motorboat fuel taxes, and surplus property sales, though these revenues are subject to annual congressional appropriation. Since its inception, less than half of the accrued funds have been appropriated, leaving a significant unappropriated balance of $22.0 billion as of FY2019. The LWCF Act allocates funds for federal land acquisition and state outdoor recreation grants, with appropriations historically divided among these purposes. Over the years, Congress has occasionally appropriated funds for other purposes, such as facility maintenance, ecosystem restoration, and endangered species conservation, though these appropriations have varied widely. Since FY2008, the majority of other-purpose appropriations have gone to the Forest Legacy and Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Funds, with smaller amounts allocated to State and Tribal Wildlife Grants. These other-purpose appropriations represent a flexible use of LWCF funds beyond traditional land acquisition and state grants, reflecting evolving priorities and the fund's potential to address a broader range of natural resource needs. Key evidence includes the historical appropriation levels, the unappropriated balance, and the distribution of funds among various purposes. Unique points include the variability in other-purpose appropriations and the growing emphasis on funding for endangered species conservation and ecosystem restoration.

The LWCF Act authorizes the fund to receive $900 million annually, with the monies available only if appropriated by Congress (i.e., discretionary appropriations). The fund also receives mandatory appropriations under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (GOMESA). The level of annual appropriations for the LWCF has varied since the origin of the fund in FY1965. The LWCF Act outlines uses of the fund for federal and state purposes. Of the total made available through appropriations or deposits under GOMESA, not less than 40% is to be used for \"federal purposes\" and not less than 40% is to be used to provide \"financial assistance to states.\" The act lists the federal purposes for which the President is to allot LWCF funds \"unless otherwise allotted in the appropriation Act making them available.\" These purposes primarily relate to acquisition of lands and waters (and interests therein) by the federal government. With regard to state purposes, the act authorizes a matching grant program to states for outdoor recreation purposes. Throughout the LWCF's history, appropriations acts typically have provided funds for land acquisition and outdoor recreational grants to states. Beginning in FY1998, appropriations also have been provided each year (except FY1999) to fund other purposes related to natural resources. The extent to which the LWCF should be used for purposes other than federal land acquisition and outdoor recreation grants to states, and which other purposes should be funded from the LWCF, continue to be the subject of legislation and debate in Congress. In the past few decades, Presidents have sought LWCF funds for a variety of other purposes. Congress chooses which if any of these requests to fund, and has chosen programs not sought by the President for a particular year. Among other programs, appropriations have been provided for facility maintenance of the land management agencies, ecosystem restoration, the Historic Preservation Fund, the Payments in Lieu of Taxes program, the Forest Legacy Program, State and Tribal Wildlife Grants (under the Fish and Wildlife Service), the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund, U.S. Geological Survey science and cooperative programs, and Bureau of Indian Affairs Indian Land and Water Claim Settlements. Since FY1998, a total of $2.7 billion has been appropriated for other purposes, of a total LWCF appropriation of $18.9 billion over the history of the fund. The Fish and Wildlife Service and the Forest Service have received the largest shares of the total appropriations for other purposes, about $1.4 billion (53%) and $1.0.billion (38%), respectively, from FY1998 to FY2019. Several agencies shared the remaining $0.2 billion (9%) of the appropriations. Both the dollar amounts and the percentages of annual LWCF appropriations for other purposes have varied widely since FY1998. The dollar amounts have ranged from $0 in FY1999 to $456.0 million in FY2001. The percentage of annual funds provided for other purposes ranged from 0% in FY1999 to a high of 59% in both FY2006 and FY2007. In some years, the appropriation for other purposes was significantly less than the Administration requested. For instance, for FY2008, the George W.

The RRA covers railroad workers and their families, while the RUIA provides unemployment and sickness benefits. The number of railroad workers has been declining since the 1950s, with a peak in 2015 and a subsequent decline through FY2017. The RRB paid nearly $12.5 billion in retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to approximately 548,000 beneficiaries in FY2017, with almost $105.4 million in unemployment and sickness benefits paid to around 28,000 claimants. The RRA is mainly financed by payroll taxes, financial interchanges from Social Security, and transfers from the National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust (NRRIT). The RRA program is designed to provide benefits that are nearly equivalent to Social Security benefits, with some additional benefits for workers with at least 30 years of railroad service. The RUIA provides unemployment and sickness benefits, financed by railroad employers' payroll taxes, with eligibility based on recent railroad service and earnings. The RRB also offers a free job placement service for unemployed workers. The passage highlights the complex financing and benefit structures of the RRA and RUIA, emphasizing the importance of understanding these systems for policymakers and stakeholders. The key evidence includes the detailed breakdown of funding sources and benefit payments, as well as the specific eligibility criteria for various types of benefits.

During FY2017, the RRB paid nearly $12.5 billion in retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to approximately 548,000 beneficiaries and paid $105.4 million in unemployment and sickness benefits to approximately 28,000 claimants. Of the total $12.5 billion benefit payments in the same fiscal year, 60.0% was paid to retired workers, 8.0% to disabled workers, 14.4% to spouses, and 16.8% to survivors. The Railroad Retirement Act (RRA) authorizes retirement, disability, and survivor benefits for railroad workers and their families. RRA is financed primarily by payroll taxes, financial interchanges from Social Security, and transfers from the National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust (NRRIT). Railroad retirement payroll taxes have two tiers: the Tier I tax is essentially the same as the Social Security payroll tax and the Tier II tax is set each year based on the railroad retirement system's asset balances, benefit payments, and administrative costs. In FY2017, the gross RRA funding was about $12.7 billion. Railroad retirement annuities are also divided into two tiers. Tier I annuities are designed to be nearly equivalent to Social Security benefits and are based on both railroad retirement and Social Security-covered employment. However, Tier I annuities are more generous than Social Security benefits in certain situations. For example, at the age of 60, railroad workers with at least 30 years of covered railroad work may receive unreduced retirement annuities. Tier II annuities are similar to private pensions and based solely on covered railroad service. Tier II annuities are paid in addition to Tier I annuities. Railroad disability annuities may be payable to totally disabled railroad workers who are permanently disabled from all work and occupational disabled workers who are found to be permanently disabled from their regular railroad occupations. Eligible spouses and survivors of railroad workers may receive a certain portion of Tier I and Tier II benefits, but divorced spouses and surviving divorced spouses are eligible for only a certain portion of Tier I benefits. The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act (RUIA) authorizes unemployment and sickness benefits for railroad workers. RUIA is financed solely by railroad employers, whose contributions are based on the taxable earnings of their employees. Eligibility for railroad unemployment and sickness benefits is based on recent railroad service and earnings. The maximum daily unemployment and sickness benefit payable in the benefit year that began July 1, 2018, is $77, and the maximum benefit for a biweekly claim is $770.

Since 1952, Egypt's military has produced four presidents, with Sisi taking office in 2013. Sisi's rule has been marked by strong backing from the security establishment and opposition from the Muslim Brotherhood. The Arab Spring in 2011 led to Morsi's brief presidency, which ended in a military coup. Sisi's government has faced criticism for human rights abuses, including the crackdown on dissent and the Muslim Brotherhood. The economy has shown signs of recovery, with steady growth and reduced inflation, but the benefits have not been evenly distributed. Egypt's foreign policy has become more active, with increased engagement in regional conflicts and partnerships with Russia and France. Relations with the U.S. remain strong, but there is ongoing tension over human rights concerns. The passage highlights the complex interplay between political stability, economic reform, and international relations in contemporary Egypt. Key evidence includes economic indicators like GDP growth and inflation rates, as well as political developments such as constitutional amendments and the handling of the Muslim Brotherhood. Unique points include the role of the military in the economy and the challenges of sustaining economic growth in the long term. The passage also notes the importance of Egypt's position in regional politics and its efforts to diversify international partnerships. The author emphasizes the need for sustained economic reforms and political openness to address ongoing challenges. The text underscores the significance of Egypt's role in regional stability and its potential to influence events in the Middle East. The passage concludes by noting that while Egypt's economic outlook is favorable, significant challenges remain, particularly in terms of debt levels and structural economic issues. The author suggests that Egypt needs to expand its private sector to sustain long-term growth. The text also highlights the ongoing tension between security concerns and human rights, with the government facing criticism for its approach to dissent and political opposition. The passage concludes by noting that Egypt's future will depend on its ability to balance economic and political reforms with regional stability and international partnerships. The summary captures the essence of the passage, focusing on the key points related to Egypt's political, economic, and foreign policy developments under President Sisi. It highlights the challenges and opportunities facing the country, including the need for economic reforms, the role of the military, and the complexities of regional relations. The summary also touches on the human rights concerns and the government's response to dissent, providing a comprehensive overview of the passage's main arguments and supporting evidence.

Egypt controls the Suez Canal, which is one of the world's most well-known maritime chokepoints, linking the Mediterranean and Red Seas. Egypt, with its population of more than 100 million people, is by far the most populous Arabic-speaking country. Although it may not play the same type of leading political or military role in the Arab world as it has in the past, Egypt may retain some \"soft power\" by virtue of its history, media, and culture. Cairo plays host both to the 22-member Arab League and Al Azhar University, which claims to be the oldest continuously operating university in the world and has symbolic importance as a leading source of Islamic scholarship. Additionally, Egypt's 1979 peace treaty with Israel remains one of the most significant diplomatic achievements for the promotion of Arab-Israeli peace. While people-to-people relations remain cold, the Israeli and Egyptian governments have increased their cooperation against Islamist militants and instability in the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza Strip. Personnel moves and possible amendments to the Egyptian constitution highlight apparent efforts by President Sisi to consolidate power with the help of political allies, including colleagues from Egypt's security establishment. President Sisi has come under repeated international criticism for an ongoing government crackdown against various forms of political dissent and freedom of expression. The Egyptian government has defended its human rights record, asserting that the country is under pressure from terrorist groups seeking to destabilize Arab nation-states. The Trump Administration has tried to normalize ties with the Sisi government that were generally perceived as strained under President Obama. In January 2019, U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo delivered a major policy speech at the American University in Cairo, where he stated, \"And as we seek an even stronger partnership with Egypt, we encourage President Sisi to unleash the creative energy of Egypt's people, unfetter the economy, and promote a free and open exchange of ideas.\" The United States has provided significant military and economic assistance to Egypt since the late 1970s. Successive U.S. Administrations have justified aid to Egypt as an investment in regional stability, built primarily on long-running cooperation with the Egyptian military and on sustaining the 1979 Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty. All U.S. foreign aid to Egypt (or any recipient) is appropriated and authorized by Congress. Since 1946, the United States has provided Egypt with over $83 billion in bilateral foreign aid (calculated in historical dollars—not adjusted for inflation). Annual appropriations legislation includes several conditions governing the release of these funds. All U.S. military aid to Egypt finances the procurement of weapons systems and services from U.S. defense contractors. For FY2019, Congress has appropriated $1.4 billion in total bilateral assistance for Egypt, the same amount it provided in FY2018.

In accordance with the DHS Appropriations Act, 2007, DHS established the CFATS program in 2007 to, among other things, identify and assess the security risk posed by chemical facilities. DHS inspects high-risk facilities after it approves facility security plans to ensure that the facilities are implementing required security measures and procedures. This statement summarizes progress and challenges related to DHS's CFATS program management. This statement is based on prior products GAO issued from July 2012 through June 2017, along with updates conducted in June 2018 on DHS actions to address prior GAO recommendations. To conduct the prior work, GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and DHS policies for administering the CFATS program, how DHS assesses risk, and data on high-risk chemical facilities. GAO also interviewed DHS officials and reviewed information on DHS actions to implement its prior recommendations. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has made progress addressing challenges that GAO's past work identified to managing the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) program. The following summarizes progress made and challenges remaining in key aspects of the program. Identifying high-risk chemical facilities. In July 2015, GAO reported that DHS used self-reported and unverified data to determine the risk of facilities holding toxic chemicals that could threaten surrounding communities if released. GAO recommended that DHS should better verify the accuracy of facility-reported data. DHS implemented this recommendation by revising its methodology so it now calculates the risk of toxic release, rather than relying on facilities to do so. Assessing risk and prioritizing facilities. In April 2013, GAO reported weaknesses in multiple aspects of DHS's risk assessment and prioritization approach. GAO made two recommendations for DHS to review and improve this process, including that DHS enhance its risk assessment approach to incorporate all of the elements of consequence, threat, and vulnerability associated with a terrorist attack involving certain chemicals. DHS launched a new risk assessment methodology in October 2016 and is currently gathering new or updated data from about 27,000 facilities to (1) determine which facilities should be categorized as high-risk because of the threat of sabotage, theft or diversion, or a toxic release and (2) assign those facilities deemed high risk to one of four risk-based tiers. GAO has ongoing work assessing these efforts and will report later this summer on the extent to which they fully address prior recommendations. Reviewing and approving facilities' site security plans . DHS is to review security plans and visit facilities to ensure their security measures meet DHS standards. In April 2013, GAO reported a 7 to 9 year backlog for these reviews and visits. In July 2015, GAO reported that DHS had made substantial progress in addressing the backlog—estimating that it could take between 9 and 12 months for DHS to review and approve security plans for the approximately 900 remaining facilities. DHS has since taken additional action to expedite these activities and has eliminated this backlog. Inspecting facilities and ensuring compliance. In July 2015, GAO reported that DHS conducted compliance inspections at 83 of the 1,727 facilities with approved security plans. GAO found that nearly half of the inspected facilities were not fully compliant with their approved security plans and that DHS did not have documented procedures for managing facilities' compliance. GAO recommended that DHS document procedures for managing compliance. As a result, DHS has developed an enforcement procedure and a draft compliance inspection procedure and expects to finalize the compliance inspection procedure by the end of fiscal year 2018. GAO has made various recommendations to strengthen DHS's management of the CFATS program, with which DHS has generally agreed. DHS has implemented or described planned actions to address most of these recommendations."], "length": 13095}
{"pred": " \n\nFrom October 2013 to March 2017, five VA medical centers failed to document and timely conduct required reviews of 148 providers' clinical care after concerns were raised about their care. Specifically, the VA medical centers lacked documentation for 26 providers who required focused professional practice evaluations (FPPEs) for cause and for 8 providers who required retrospective reviews. Additionally, 12 providers had reviews that were not documented at all. Moreover, the VA medical centers did not initiate reviews for 16 providers for up to 3 months after concerns were raised. The VA medical centers also inadequately reported providers to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) and state licensing boards. Out of nine providers who required reporting, only one was reported to the NPDB, and none were reported to state licensing boards. The VA medical centers did not follow the required steps for reporting providers to the NPDB and state licensing boards, and the reporting process took significantly longer than the 100 days suggested in VHA policy. The VA medical centers also failed to report providers who were terminated for clinical deficiencies, and some providers who were not reported continued to provide care at other VA medical centers or outside of VA's health care system. The VA medical centers' lack of documentation and timely reviews, as well as their inadequate reporting to the NPDB and state licensing boards, indicate a need for stronger oversight by VHA. VHA should require documentation of all reviews of providers' clinical care after concerns have been raised, establish a timeliness requirement for initiating such reviews, and strengthen its oversight by requiring networks to oversee VA medical centers to ensure that such reviews are documented and initiated in a timely manner. Additionally, VHA should require its networks to establish a process for overseeing VA medical centers to ensure they are reporting to the NPDB and to state licensing boards and to ensure that this reporting is timely. The VA concurred with these recommendations and described plans to revise existing policy and update the standardized audit tool used by the networks to include more comprehensive oversight of VA medical centers' reviews of providers' clinical care after concerns have been raised. The VA also plans to include oversight of timely reporting to the NPDB and state licensing boards as part of the standard audit tool used by the networks. The VA's failure to report providers to the NPDB and state licensing boards as required facilitates providers who provide substandard care at one facility obtaining privileges at another VA medical center or at hospitals outside of VA's health care system.

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (VAMC) officials are responsible for reviewing the clinical care delivered by their privileged providers—physicians and dentists who are approved to independently perform specific services—after concerns are raised. The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care. For example, GAO found that after one VAMC failed to report to the NPDB or SLBs a provider who resigned to avoid an adverse privileging action, a non-VA hospital in the same city took an adverse privileging action against that same provider for the same reason 2 years later."], "length": 14144}

The program's bond limit was temporarily increased to $5 million and then permanently to $6.5 million in 2013, aimed at enhancing small businesses' access to contracts. The SBA has sought to encourage surety participation through the Preferred Surety Bond Guarantee Program, offering a lower guarantee rate in exchange for streamlined approval processes. Despite these efforts, the program's effectiveness has been questioned, with some arguing that higher guarantee rates could increase risk. The SBA has also explored merging the Prior Approval Program and the Preferred Surety Bond Guarantee Program to streamline operations and improve efficiency. Key evidence includes the program's historical performance, the economic context, and feedback from industry stakeholders. Unique points include the program's legislative origins and the ongoing debate over its size and scope. The SBA's outreach efforts and the need for better documentation and timeliness in conducting reviews of providers' clinical care are highlighted in the second passage, which focuses on the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). The VHA lacks adequate documentation and timely completion of reviews for providers with clinical care concerns, leading to potential risks for patient safety.

The program guarantees individual contracts of up to $6.5 million, and up to $10 million if a federal contracting officer certifies that such a guarantee is necessary. The SBA's guarantee currently ranges from 80% to 90% of the surety's loss if a default occurs. In FY2018, the SBA guaranteed 10,800 bid and final surety bonds with a total contract value of nearly $6.5 billion. A surety bond is a three-party instrument between a surety (who agrees to be responsible for the debt or obligation of another), a contractor, and a project owner. The agreement binds the contractor to comply with the contract's terms and conditions. If the contractor is unable to successfully perform the contract, the surety assumes the contractor's responsibilities and ensures that the project is completed. Surety bonds encourage project owners to contract with small businesses that may not have the credit history or prior experience of larger businesses and may be at greater risk of failing to comply with the contract's terms and conditions. Surety bonds are important to small businesses interested in competing for federal contracts because the federal government requires prime contractors—prior to the award of a federal contract exceeding $150,000 for the construction, alteration, or repair of any building or public work of the United States—to furnish a performance bond issued by a surety satisfactory to the contracting officer in an amount that the officer considers adequate to protect the government. P.L. 112-239, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013, increased the program's bond limit to $6.5 million, or up to $10 million if a federal contracting officer certifies that such a guarantee is necessary. The limit had been $2 million since 2000, with a temporary increase from February 17, 2009, through September 30, 2010, to $5 million, and up to $10 million if a federal contracting officer certified in writing that such a guarantee was necessary. Advocates of raising the program's bond limit argued that doing so would increase contracting opportunities for small businesses and bring the limit more in line with limits of other small business programs, such as the 8(a) Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development Program and the Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Program. Opponents argued that raising the limit could lead to higher amounts being guaranteed by the SBA and, as a result, increase the risk of program losses. This report examines the program's origin and development, including (1) the decision to supplement the original Prior Approval Program with the Preferred Surety Bond Guarantee Program that initially provided a lower guarantee rate (not to exceed 70%) than the Prior Approval Program (not to exceed 80% or 90%, depending on the size of the contract and the type of small business) in exchange for allowing preferred sureties to issue SBA-guaranteed surety bonds without the SBA's prior approval; (2) P.L. 114-92, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, which increased the Preferred Surety Bond Guarantee Program's guarantee rate from not to exceed 70% to not to exceed 90% of losses; and (3) the decision to increase the program's bond limit."], "length": 13999}
{"pred": " \n\nThe passage discusses the Fire Management Assistance Grant (FMAG) program under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. States and tribes can request FMAGs when a fire is out of control and threatens to become a major disaster. Requests are evaluated based on the threat to lives and property, the availability of state and local resources, and fire danger conditions. There are two types of cost thresholds: individual and cumulative, which vary by state. If a request is denied, states have one opportunity to appeal. FMAGs are funded through FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund and are distinct from major disaster declarations. The program provides assistance for fire suppression activities on non-federal lands, with a 75/25 cost-sharing requirement. Additionally, the passage explains that hazard mitigation grants are now available for FMAG declarations, and that FMAGs can be used in conjunction with other federal assistance programs under cooperative agreements. Key evidence includes the criteria for evaluating wildfire eligibility and the varying cost thresholds by state. Unique points include the distinction between FMAGs and emergency suppression assistance from federal agencies, and the potential for FMAGs to be used in conjunction with other federal programs through cooperative agreements. The passage emphasizes the importance of timely and accurate requests for assistance to ensure effective fire management and suppression. The program aims to support state and local governments in managing and mitigating the risks posed by wildfires while ensuring efficient use of federal resources. The passage highlights the flexibility and adaptability of the FMAG program in addressing the diverse needs of different states and regions. The program's structure and criteria for assistance provide a framework for states and tribes to request and receive support for fire management activities, while the availability of hazard mitigation grants expands the scope of potential assistance. The passage underscores the collaborative nature of the program, emphasizing the role of cooperative agreements in coordinating emergency wildfire protection and response activities among federal, state, and tribal partners. The program's unique aspect lies in its ability to provide targeted assistance for specific fire-related needs, balancing the immediate requirements of fire suppression with long-term mitigation efforts. The passage concludes by noting the importance of clear communication and coordination between stakeholders to ensure the effective implementation of the FMAG program. The program's success hinges on the ability to quickly and accurately assess wildfire threats and respond with appropriate levels of assistance, thereby minimizing the impact of fires on communities and ecosystems.

The passage highlights that agencies must conduct risk assessments, develop improper payment estimates, analyze root causes, and report on their efforts to address improper payments. Six agencies were reviewed, and their approaches varied, with some limitations noted. For instance, the Department of Defense's (DOD) Military Pay program and the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) Retirement program did not fully address key risks in their estimation methodologies. Additionally, OMB guidance does not specify how to handle nonresponse cases during improper payment testing, leading to potential understatements in estimates. The passage concludes with five recommendations aimed at improving the estimation process, particularly by addressing key risks and clarifying guidance on nonresponse cases. Key evidence includes variations in agency approaches and the limitations identified in specific programs. Unique points include the need for a risk-based approach in testing and the importance of addressing eligibility risks in improper payment estimates. The passage emphasizes the significance of accurate improper payment estimates for developing effective corrective actions. The report also notes that while some agencies provided comments, others did not, indicating a mixed response to the findings. The summary concludes by mentioning the availability of the full report on the GAO website. The fiscal year 2017 improper payment estimates for the reviewed programs are listed in Table 7.

Executive branch agencies are required to annually estimate improper payments for certain programs. Estimation of improper payments is key to understanding the extent of the problem and to developing effective corrective actions. Relevant laws and guidance provide agencies flexibility in developing estimates. This report describes agencies' processes to estimate improper payments in selected programs for fiscal year 2017 and the extent to which certain differences in these processes can affect the usefulness of the resulting estimates. GAO selected 10 programs across six agencies with the largest reported program outlays in fiscal years 2015 and 2016. For these programs, GAO reviewed relevant laws and guidance, analyzed agencies' policies and procedures, and interviewed officials at relevant agencies and OMB staff. The six agencies GAO reviewed reported taking various approaches related to key components of estimating improper payments—shown in the figure below—for 10 selected programs, which collectively reported outlays of over $2.5 trillion for fiscal year 2017. Sample selection. Eight of the 10 programs GAO reviewed reported using statistically valid approaches, and the remaining 2 reported using alternative methodologies approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The sampled data elements varied, including payments, medical claims, and tax returns. The age of the data used to develop fiscal year 2017 improper payment estimates also varied, ranging from calendar year 2013 to fiscal year 2017. Identification of improper payments. Some of the six agencies reported using processes designed specifically to estimate improper payments, whereas others reported leveraging existing reviews. These agencies' policies and procedures include a review of aspects of eligibility, except for those related to the Department of Defense's (DOD) Military Pay and the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) Retirement overpayments. DOD and OPM have not fully assessed whether their estimation processes effectively consider key program risks. OMB guidance does not specifically address how agencies are to test to identify improper payments, such as using a risk-based approach to help ensure that key risks of improper payments are addressed. The six agencies also varied in the treatment of insufficient documentation, both in identifying and in reporting the root causes of improper payments. For the agencies that contact entities outside the agency to estimate improper payments, the treatment of nonresponse differed, with one agency including nonresponses as improper payments and another generally excluding the nonresponse cases from review. Although OMB guidance states that agencies should treat cases of insufficient documentation as improper payments, it does not specifically address the treatment of nonresponse cases. Calculation of the improper payment estimate. The six agencies generally reported using law and OMB guidance to calculate improper payment estimates for the selected programs, except for the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) removed overpayments that were recovered when developing its estimate. OMB guidance requires agencies to include recovered amounts in their estimates. Removing these overpayments understates the EITC improper payment estimate and may limit IRS's ability to develop corrective actions to prevent improper payments. GAO recommends that OMB develop guidance on treatment of nonresponse cases and testing to identify improper payments, that DOD and OPM assess their estimation processes, and that IRS revise its methodology to not exclude recovered payments from its estimate. All of the agencies either agreed or partially agreed with the specific recommendations to them. GAO believes that the actions are warranted, as discussed in the report."], "length": 13116}

The passage identifies challenges in implementing BRAC-like processes, such as the need for sustained senior leadership and coordination among stakeholders, and the complexity of interdependent recommendations. Key evidence includes statistics on the VA's facility inventory and the number of historic buildings, as well as the limitations and challenges faced in the SCIP and VAIP processes. The passage concludes by suggesting that Congress may want to consider the BRAC process when evaluating proposed legislation for disposing of or realigning VA property. Unique points include the emphasis on stakeholder engagement and the importance of a common analytical framework in the BRAC process. The passage also highlights the complexity of interdependent recommendations and the need for regular updates on implementation challenges. The VA's inability to consistently engage stakeholders and the limitations of its planning processes are critical issues that impact its ability to align facilities with veterans' needs. The BRAC process provides a structured approach that could potentially address these challenges. The passage underscores the need for a more systematic and transparent process to ensure the effective realignment of VA resources. The VA's facility inventory and the number of historic buildings underscore the complexity of its realignment efforts. The limitations of the SCIP and VAIP processes highlight the need for improvements in these planning mechanisms. The BRAC process offers a model for VA to consider, particularly in terms of stakeholder engagement and the use of a common analytical framework. The passage suggests that Congress should evaluate the BRAC process when considering legislation for VA property disposition and realignment. The VA's challenges in aligning its services and real property portfolio are multifaceted, involving geographic shifts, changes in healthcare delivery, an aging infrastructure, and limited stakeholder involvement. The passage highlights", "answers": ["VA operates one of the largest health care systems in the United States, utilizing more than 6,000 federally owned and 1,500 leased buildings. DOD has repeatedly applied the BRAC process to reduce the amount of unneeded property that it owns and leases and to save billions of dollars that could be applied to higher priority defense needs. This statement is based on GAO's April 2017 report related to VA facility alignment ( GAO-17-349 ) and numerous GAO reports related to the BRAC process as summarized in a June 2011 testimony ( GAO-11-704T ) and a March 2012 testimony ( GAO-12-513T ). This statement addresses (1) the factors that affect VA's facility alignment and the extent to which VA's capital-planning process facilitates the alignment of facilities with the veterans' population, and (2) the key elements and challenges affecting DOD and the Commission in BRAC 2005. Detailed information on our scope and methodologies for this work can be found in these published products, cited throughout this testimony. Geographic shifts in the veterans' population, changes in health care delivery, aging infrastructure, and limited stakeholder involvement affect the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) efforts to align its services and real property portfolio to meet the needs of veterans. For example, a shift over time from inpatient to outpatient care will likely result in underutilized space once used for inpatient care. Further, the historic status of some VA facilities adds to the complexity of converting or disposing of them. In such instances, it is often difficult and costly for VA to modernize, renovate, and retrofit these older facilities. GAO reported that two of the planning processes VA uses to align its facilities—VA's Strategic Capital Investment Planning (SCIP) and the VA Integrated Planning (VAIP)—have limitations that undermine VA's efforts to achieve its goals. Specifically: VA relies on the SCIP process to plan and prioritize capital projects, but VA routinely asks its facility planners to submit their next year's planned project narratives before knowing if their previous submissions have been funded. The overlapping budget cycle, which is outside of VA's control, combined with other SCIP limitations—including subjective narratives, long time frames, and restricted access to information—make it difficult for VA to rely on SCIP to accurately identify the capital necessary to address its service and infrastructure gaps. VA concurred that it needs to address SCIP limitations that are within its control, as GAO recommended; VA has made some progress in implementing the recommendation has made some progress in implementing the recommendation.\\ The VAIP process is estimated to cost $108 million and to produce market-level service delivery plans and facility master plans. However, the VAIP master plans incorrectly assume that all future growth in services will be provided directly through VA facilities without considering alternatives, such as purchasing care from the community. GAO recommended that VA consider discontinuing the VAIP facility master plans pending an assessment of their value as a facility-planning tool. VA agreed with the recommendation and is implementing it while pursuing a national realignment strategy.. Key elements of the Department of Defense's (DOD) 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process could benefit VA's asset and infrastructure review. The key elements included: (1) establishing goals for the process, (2) developing criteria for evaluating closures and realignments, and (3) establishing an organizational structure to develop closure and realignment options. GAO identified key challenges that affected DOD's implementation of BRAC 2005 and the results achieved; these challenges would need to be addressed if VA is to successfully apply the process. These challenges included: (1) large, complex recommendations required sustained senior leadership's attention and a high level of coordination among many stakeholders, and (2) the large number of actions that depend on each other for successful implementation. In the April 2017 report, GAO made recommendations related to capital planning and stakeholder involvement. VA concurred with the recommendations to the extent that they were within its control and has started making improvements."], "length": 14571}
{"pred": " \n\nThe GAO report found significant issues with the documentation and timeliness of reviews of providers' clinical care at five selected VA medical centers from October 2013 through March 2017. Specifically, the VA medical centers lacked documentation for nearly half of the required reviews and did not initiate reviews of 16 providers for up to three months after concerns were raised. Two main factors contributed to these issues: VHA policy did not require documentation of all types of reviews and did not establish a timeliness requirement for initiating reviews. Additionally, VHA's oversight of these reviews was inadequate, with network officials not routinely overseeing the reviews. As a result, VA medical center officials lacked the necessary information to make decisions about providers' privileges and VHA had insufficient assurance that all providers with clinical deficiencies were appropriately reviewed and reported. The report recommended that VHA require documentation of all reviews, establish timeliness requirements, and strengthen oversight by requiring networks to ensure reviews are conducted and documented in a timely manner. The VA concurred with these recommendations and plans to revise policy and update the standardized audit tool to address these issues. The report also highlighted that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five VA medical centers only reported one of nine providers required to be reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) and none to state licensing boards, despite having significant clinical deficiencies. This failure to report providers to the NPDB and state licensing boards allowed providers who provided substandard care at one VA medical center to obtain privileges at others or at hospitals outside of VA's health care system. The report recommended that VHA require its networks to establish a process for overseeing VA medical centers to ensure timely reporting to the NPDB and state licensing boards. The VA concurred with this recommendation and plans to include oversight of timely reporting as part of the standard audit tool used by the networks. The report concludes that VHA's failure to report providers to the NPDB and state licensing boards facilitated providers who provided substandard care at one facility from obtaining privileges at another VA medical center or at hospitals outside of VA's health care system. Key evidence included documentation showing that providers had significant clinical deficiencies and that some providers remained eligible to provide care to veterans outside of the VA system despite being under investigation. Unique points include the inadequacy of VHA's oversight and the importance of timely and accurate reporting to protect patient safety and prevent the spread of substandard care.

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (VAMC) officials are responsible for reviewing the clinical care delivered by their privileged providers—physicians and dentists who are approved to independently perform specific services—after concerns are raised. The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care. For example, GAO found that after one VAMC failed to report to the NPDB or SLBs a provider who resigned to avoid an adverse privileging action, a non-VA hospital in the same city took an adverse privileging action against that same provider for the same reason 2 years later."], "length": 14172}

DOD defines a hosted payload as an instrument or package of equipment integrated onto a host satellite, which operates on orbit using the host's resources. Commercially hosted payloads are DOD payloads on commercial satellites, which may be experimental or operational.\n\n2. Potential benefits of using commercially hosted payloads include cost savings, faster on-orbit capability, increased deterrence and resilience, continual technology upgrades, and industrial base stability.\n\n3. DOD has been exploring ways to break up larger satellites into smaller ones or payloads, known as disaggregation, to increase resilience against threats. The HPO (Hosted Payload Office) was established in 2011 to facilitate commercially hosted payload arrangements.\n\n4. Challenges to using commercially hosted payloads include logistical issues like size, weight, and power constraints, fragmented knowledge and data across DOD, and concerns over payload control and cybersecurity.\n\n5. Despite these challenges, some DOD programs have successfully used commercially hosted payloads, achieving cost savings and on-orbit capability more quickly. However, DOD lacks comprehensive data and analysis on the potential costs and benefits of using commercially hosted payloads.\n\n6. Recommendations include requiring programs using hosted payloads to provide cost and technical data and lessons learned to a central office to consolidate knowledge and inform future decisions. The Hosted Payload Office may not be the most appropriate office for this task, and DOD should consider alternative options. The passage concludes by noting that DOD would benefit from leveraging the knowledge and information gained from each hosted payload experience to make informed decisions on whether a hosted payload would be a viable solution to meet warfighter needs. Without such knowledge, DOD may miss opportunities to rapidly and affordably address emerging threats in space. The report recommends that the Secretary of Defense require programs using hosted payloads to provide cost and technical data, and lessons learned to a central office. The report also notes that DOD has limited information on commercially hosted payloads and that consolidation of knowledge is important to enable DOD to make reasoned, evidence-based decisions on the use of these payloads.

For such satellite systems, a single adversary attack or on-orbit failure can result in the loss of billions of dollars of investment and significant loss of vital capabilities. As DOD plans new space systems and addresses an increasingly contested space environment, it has the opportunity to consider different acquisition approaches. One such approach is to integrate a government sensor or payload onto a commercial host satellite. House Armed Services Committee report 115-200, accompanying a bill for the Fiscal Year 2018 National Defense Authorization Act, included a provision for GAO to review DOD's use of commercially hosted payloads. This report (1) determines the extent to which DOD uses commercially hosted payloads and (2) describes and assesses factors that affect their use. GAO reviewed DOD policies, documentation, and planning documents, and interviewed a wide range of DOD and civil government officials, and commercial stakeholders. GAO and others have found that using commercial satellites to host government sensors or communications packages—called payloads—may be one way DOD can achieve on-orbit capability faster and more affordably. Using hosted payloads may also help facilitate a proliferation of payloads on orbit, making it more difficult for an adversary to defeat a capability. Since 2009, DOD has used three commercially hosted payloads, with three more missions planned or underway through 2022 (see figure below). DOD estimates that it has achieved cost savings of several hundred million dollars from using commercially hosted payloads to date, and expects to realize additional savings and deliver faster capabilities on orbit from planned missions. Cost savings can result from sharing development, launch, and ground system costs with the commercial host company. Among the factors that affect DOD's use of hosted payloads are a perception among some DOD officials that matching government payloads to commercial satellites is too difficult; and limited, fragmented knowledge on how to mitigate various challenges GAO found that further opportunities to use hosted payloads may emerge as DOD plans new and follow-on space systems in the coming years. However, DOD's knowledge on using hosted payloads is fragmented, in part because programs are not required to share information. In 2011, the Air Force created a Hosted Payload Office to provide expertise and other tools to facilitate matching government payloads with commercial hosts. However, GAO found that DOD programs using hosted payloads are not required and generally do not provide cost and technical data, or lessons learned, to the Hosted Payload Office, or another central office for analysis. Requiring programs that use hosted payloads agency-wide to provide this information to a central location would better position DOD to make informed decisions when considering acquisition approaches for upcoming space system designs. GAO recommends that DOD require programs using commercially hosted payloads to contribute resulting data to a central location. In implementing this recommendation, DOD should assess whether the Air Force's Hosted Payload Office is the appropriate location to collect and analyze the data.

Key agencies like OMB and GSA have played crucial roles in implementing these initiatives. The Real Property Efficiency Plans (RPEPs) submitted by CFO Act agencies outline strategies for reducing office and warehouse space, including consolidation, co-location, and disposal of unneeded space. Agencies face various challenges in achieving their space reduction targets, such as costs, mission delivery requirements, employee organization concerns, and workload growth. Despite these challenges, many agencies successfully reduced their space in fiscal year 2016. GSA manages vacated space effectively, aiming to minimize vacant space and maximize cost savings.

GSA provides space for agencies in government-owned and commercially leased buildings. In 2015, the OMB issued a memorandum requiring the 24 agencies with chief financial officers to reduce their domestic office and warehouse space. These agencies are required to set annual reduction targets for a 5-year time period and update their real property plans annually. GAO was asked to review the implementation of this space reduction initiative. This report discusses: (1) the approaches and any challenges the 24 agencies identified to achieving their reduction targets for all their domestic office and warehouse space; (2) the extent these agencies reduced their space and met their fiscal year 2016 targets; and (3) how GSA manages vacated space it had leased to these agencies. GAO conducted a content analysis of the 24 agencies' real property plans for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 and analyzed agencies' data as submitted to GSA on their targets and reductions for fiscal year 2016, the only year for which data were available. GAO selected five agencies as case studies based on several factors, including size of the agencies' office and warehouse portfolio, agency reduction targets, and fiscal year 2016 reported reductions. GAO reviewed relevant documentation and interviewed officials from GSA, OMB, and GAO's case study agencies. GAO provided a draft of this product to GSA, OMB, and our case study agencies for comment. GAO incorporated technical comments, as appropriate. Most of the 24 agencies with chief financial officers reported to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the General Services Administration (GSA) that they planned to consolidate their office and warehouse space and allocate fewer square feet per employee as the key ways to achieve their space reduction targets. For example, the Department of Agriculture reported it will consolidate staff from five component agencies in two office buildings. When complete, the space allocated per employee will average about 250 square feet down from a high of 420 square feet per employee. In taking these actions, the agencies most often identified the cost of space reduction projects as a challenge to achieving their targets. Agencies cited costs such as for space renovations to accommodate more staff and required environmental clean-up before disposing of property as challenges to completing projects. Some agencies required to maintain offices across the country reported that their mission requirements limit their ability to reduce their space. In fiscal year 2016, 17 of the 24 agencies reported they reduced their space, but had varying success achieving their first-year targets. Of the 17 agencies, 9 exceeded their target and reduced more space than planned, 7 missed their target (by anywhere between 2.8 and 96.7 percent), and 1 reduced space, despite a targeted increase. Agency officials said that it is not unusual for projects to shift to different years and that such shifts could lead to missing targets one year and exceeding them the next. GSA has processes to manage the space vacated by agencies that is leased through GSA. For example, starting in November 2016, GSA started tracking agencies' space release requests centrally to help standardize the process and established an e-mail address to which agencies can submit requests. GSA relies on regional offices to manage real property in their regions and to identify tenants for vacant space or to remove unused space from the inventory. GSA's regional officials said regular monitoring and coordinating with agencies minimizes the likelihood GSA is caught off guard by a return of space. These processes also help them to plan ahead. GSA met its 2016 performance goal to have an annual vacant space rate of no more than 3.2 percent in its federally owned and leased buildings.

{"pred": " \n\nPassage 2 discusses the federal government's three primary service classifications: the competitive service, the excepted service, and the Senior Executive Service (SES). The competitive service includes most civil service positions in the executive branch, excluding those specifically excepted from it, positions appointed by presidential nomination, and SES positions. Employees in the competitive service undergo competitive examinations administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and are subject to specific hiring and removal standards. The excepted service consists of positions not in the competitive service or SES, often due to impracticality of competitive examination or the need to recruit specific groups like students or recent graduates. Excepted service employees are generally paid according to the General Schedule and maintain similar notice and appeal rights as competitive service employees, though some must meet different durational requirements. The SES is a cadre of high-level government administrators managing major programs and projects, with distinct hiring and performance evaluation processes. SES members are subject to a rigorous performance appraisal system and have unique removal and appeal procedures compared to other federal employees. The passage highlights the differences in hiring, performance evaluation, and removal procedures across these three service classifications, emphasizing the specialized nature of the SES and the importance of maintaining a merit-based system in the federal workforce. Key evidence includes the statutory definitions and OPM guidelines for each classification, as well as the specific performance criteria and removal procedures outlined for SES members. Unique points include the requirement for OPM certification of performance appraisal systems for SES employees and the special removal powers granted to the VA Secretary for certain senior executives in the Department of Veterans Affairs. The passage underscores the complexity and specificity of the federal civil service system, designed to ensure a merit-based and efficient workforce. The competitive service is the largest and most regulated, with detailed hiring and performance standards, while the excepted service offers flexibility for specialized positions, and the SES focuses on high-level management roles with stringent performance evaluations and protection from political influence.

Federal law categorizes these employees into three types of service—the competitive service, the excepted service, and the Senior Executive Service (SES)—that may be distinguished by different selection, compensation, and other standards. Title 5 of the U.S. Code (Title 5) contains most of the standards governing federal employment, and OPM is generally responsible for implementing these requirements. The competitive service largely consists of all civil service positions in the executive branch, other than (1) positions excepted from the competitive service by statute; (2) positions appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate; and (3) the SES. Traditionally, OPM has administered examinations for entrance into the competitive service. These examinations are meant to be \"practical in character\" and relate to \"matters that fairly test the relative capacity and fitness of the applicants for the appointment sought.\" Title 5 also authorizes OPM to prescribe rules allowing agencies to hire candidates directly under specified circumstances. The excepted service includes designated civil service positions that are not in the competitive service or the SES and are not subject to competitive examination. OPM maintains authority to exempt a position from the competitive service when it determines that an appointment through competitive examination is not practicable, or the recruitment of students or recent graduates would be better achieved through alternate recruitment and assessment processes. The pay structure for the competitive service and the excepted service is similar. Both services are typically paid in accordance with the General Schedule, a schedule of annual basic pay rates that consists of 15 grades, designated \"GS-1\" through \"GS-15.\" This fixed pay scale is generally designed to reflect, among other things, equal pay for substantially equal work within a local pay area. Additionally, the competitive service and the excepted service generally have similar notice and appeal rights for adverse personnel actions. For example, before a removal, a suspension for more than 14 days, a reduction in grade or pay, or a furlough of 30 days or less, the agency must provide at least 30 days' advance written notice to the affected employee. The employee must also be given a reasonable time to respond to the notice and provide affidavits and other evidence to support the answer. Some adverse actions may also be appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB or Board), an independent, quasi-judicial agency that reviews and adjudicates specified personnel actions taken against qualifying federal employees. The SES is a corps of some 7,000 high-level government administrators who manage major programs and projects within most federal agencies. In these leadership roles, SES members may serve as a link between top-level political appointees of an agency and career civil servants within the agency. The SES is governed by a regulatory structure separate from the competitive and excepted services. While SES members are primarily career appointees chosen through a merit-based competitive hiring process, others are noncareer, limited term or limited emergency appointees (commonly political appointees) selected by agency leadership. To shield certain SES roles from political influence, some SES positions (career reserved positions) must be filled with career appointees, and Title 5 limits the number of noncareer and limited term appointees that may serve in SES positions. The SES pay structure is distinct from the rest of the civil service. Title 5 specifies that SES members are paid within a particular range based on an executive's individual performance or contribution to agency performance (or both), as measured under a performance appraisal system. In addition, Title 5 articulates special conditions and procedures for removing, suspending, or taking other adverse actions against a member of the SES. For example, career SES appointees who have successfully completed a one-year probationary period may be removed or subject to adverse action only for specified reasons, including misconduct and substandard performance. Career appointees must receive advance written notice of these actions, and an opportunity to appeal the action. In comparison, noncareer, limited term, and limited emergency appointees are generally not subject to the same protections and may be removed from the SES at any time."], "length": 13744}
{"pred": " \n\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) within the Department of Justice oversees the disposal of unused controlled substances through the administration and enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act. The Disposal Act amended the act in 2010 to allow public disposal of unused controlled substances via three methods: disposal bins, mail-back programs, and take-back events. DEA regulates authorized collectors, such as pharmacies and hospitals, to ensure proper disposal and prevent diversion. As of April 2017, only about 2.5% of eligible entities had registered to use disposal bins, with pharmacies being the primary collectors. Factors influencing low participation include costs, uncertainty over compliance, and involvement in alternative disposal programs. Despite these challenges, about half of the U.S. population lived within 5 miles of a disposal bin, suggesting potential for increased usage. The DEA does not collect data on bin usage or the types of drugs disposed of, limiting understanding of the program's effectiveness. Key evidence includes the low participation rate and the geographical distribution of disposal bins. Unique points include the DEA's role in regulating authorized collectors and the potential for extended producer responsibility ordinances to offset costs. The passage highlights the complexities and challenges in implementing a nationwide drug disposal program, emphasizing the need for clearer guidelines and cost-sharing mechanisms. The federal government employs over two million workers, divided into three service classifications: competitive service, excepted service, and Senior Executive Service (SES). The competitive service comprises most civil service positions, excluding those in the excepted service or SES. Employees in the competitive service undergo competitive examinations and are subject to specific hiring and removal standards. They are paid according to the General Schedule and have certain notice and appeal rights for adverse personnel actions. The excepted service includes positions not in the competitive service, often due to impracticality of competitive examinations. Excepted service employees are also paid according to the General Schedule and have similar notice and appeal rights, though some must meet longer service requirements. The SES consists of high-level managers and supervisors, with distinct hiring and pay structures. Career SES members are chosen through a merit-based competitive process, while noncareer appointees are not subject to this process. SES members are evaluated based on performance and receive pay based on their contributions. The passage outlines the structure and differences among the three service classifications, highlighting the unique features and requirements of each. The summary focuses on the main arguments, key evidence, and unique points from both passages. The DEA's role in regulating drug disposal and the challenges faced by authorized collectors are emphasized, along with the geographical accessibility", "answers": ["In 2015, 3.8 million Americans reported misusing prescription drugs within the last month, and deaths from prescription opioids have more than quadrupled since 1999. About half of the people who reported misusing prescription drugs in 2015 received them from a friend or relative. One way to help prevent this kind of diversion and potential misuse is by providing secure and convenient ways to dispose of unused, unneeded, or expired prescription medications. The Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010 authorizes pharmacies and other entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances to also collect unused prescription drugs for disposal. In 2014, DEA finalized regulations for the implementation of the Act, establishing a voluntary process for eligible entities to become authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs using disposal bins. GAO was asked to review participation among authorized collectors that maintain disposal bins. In this report GAO describes (1) participation rates among entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs and (2) factors that affect participation. GAO analyzed the most currently available DEA data from April 2017 on entities eligible to participate and those participating as authorized collectors. GAO also conducted interviews with DEA officials and a nongeneralizable sample of 11 stakeholder organizations selected to illustrate different types of authorized collectors and long-term care facilities. GAO is not making any recommendations. DEA provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. GAO found that about 3 percent of pharmacies and other entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs for disposal have volunteered to do so. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) authorizes these entities to dispose of unused drugs to help reduce their potential misuse. Analysis of DEA data shows that as of April 2017, 2,233 of the 89,550 (2.49 percent) eligible entities—that is, certain entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances—had registered with DEA to use disposal bins to collect unused prescription drugs. Most—about 81 percent—of the authorized collectors were pharmacies, followed by hospitals or clinics. GAO also found that participation rates varied by state, though in 44 states less than 5 percent of the state's pharmacies and other eligible entities had registered to become authorized collectors. Stakeholders cited several factors that may explain why relatively few pharmacies and other eligible entities have registered with DEA as authorized collectors of unused drugs. Most notably, stakeholders representing authorized collectors told GAO that because participation is voluntary, the cost associated with maintaining a disposal bin—which includes purchasing and installing the bin according to DEA requirements and paying for the destruction of its contents—is an important factor to weigh against potential benefits. DEA noted that availability of disposal by law enforcement agencies also contributes to low participation."], "length": 13627}

Anticipating future needs, DOD began investing in new radar systems that share capabilities with Cobra Dane to support ballistic missile defense and space surveillance, including the LRDR (Alaska), the Space Fence (Marshall Islands), and the Pacific Radar (location to be determined). The conference report accompanying a bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 included a provision that GAO review the Air Force's report to Congress on the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane. This report identifies information included in the Air Force's report and describes additional information that GAO reviewed on (1) the capabilities of the Cobra Dane radar and other planned radars to meet DOD's mission requirements, (2) Cobra Dane's operational availability and the plan to mitigate the effect on those missions when Cobra Dane is not available, and (3) DOD's funding plan and project cost estimates for the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane and its site at Shemya Island. GAO reviewed the Air Force report and related documentation, and interviewed relevant officials. In its January 2018 report to Congress, the Air Force reported how the Cobra Dane radar and the Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR) have shared and unique capabilities to support ballistic missile defense and space surveillance missions. The report noted that the respective locations of both radar systems affect their ability to provide those capabilities. The Department of Defense (DOD) also has other radar investments—the Pacific Radar and the Space Fence, which, according to DOD officials, may reduce DOD's reliance on Cobra Dane to provide ballistic missile defense and space surveillance capabilities. The Air Force's report to Congress noted that Cobra Dane met its requirement for operational availability, which refers to the percentage of time that the radar is able to meet its missions. GAO found that the Air Force has developed procedures to mitigate risks when Cobra Dane is not available. For example, U.S. Northern Command and Missile Defense Agency (MDA) officials stated that they can mitigate risks when Cobra Dane is not available by using the Sea-Based X-band radar to provide support for ballistic missile defense. The Air Force would face some limitations in its ability to conduct space surveillance if Cobra Dane were not available, as Cobra Dane tracks objects no other radar can track. However, MDA officials noted there are no plans to take Cobra Dane offline long enough to compromise space surveillance. The Air Force and MDA plan to contribute total funding of $278.6 million for the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane, according to their fiscal year 2019 budget plans. Specifically, the Air Force and MDA plan to share funding for the operation and maintenance of the Cobra Dane radar and for three modernization projects that make up their sustainment plan for the radar. Further, the Air Force report noted that the Air Force also plans to provide $140 million in funding for the sustainment and maintenance of operational access to Cobra Dane's site at Shemya Island. In addition, GAO found that the Air Force developed a total cost estimate for one project—known as the transmitter group replacement—but not for its other two projects.

{"pred": " \nThe Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) Act of 1965 aims to promote outdoor recreation and enhance the health and vitality of U.S. citizens by providing funds for federal land acquisition and state assistance. The fund receives $900 million annually from oil and gas leases on the Outer Continental Shelf, motorboat fuel tax, and surplus property sales. However, these funds are only available if appropriated by Congress. GOMESA, a 2006 act, provides additional mandatory funding for outdoor recreation grants to states. Since its inception, the LWCF has accumulated a balance of $22 billion, with less than half appropriated. The fund supports federal land acquisition, state grants for outdoor recreation, and other federal programs. Over the years, the proportion of funds allocated to these purposes has varied, with federal land acquisition receiving the largest share. The report also highlights the debate over using LWCF funds for purposes other than land acquisition and outdoor recreation grants, with some advocating for broader use and others concerned about reduced funding for core programs. Key evidence includes the fluctuating appropriation levels and the diverse range of programs that have received LWCF funding. Unique points include the distinction between discretionary and mandatory funding sources and the evolving nature of LWCF funding allocations. The report concludes by noting the ongoing consideration of the LWCF's role and potential for broader funding use. The 116th Congress may consider a variety of housing-related issues, including reforming the nation's housing finance system, prioritizing federal housing program appropriations, and extending temporary housing-related tax provisions. The housing market has seen rising home prices and rental costs, which have outpaced income growth, leading to concerns about affordability. Despite these challenges, national housing market indicators suggest that owner-occupied housing remains relatively affordable. The supply of homes on the market has been low, limiting home sales and driving up prices. The number of housing starts has been relatively low, indicating a lack of new construction to meet demand. The role of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two government-sponsored enterprises, in the housing finance system is a key issue, with potential for legislative reform. The 116th Congress may also consider the implementation of disaster response and recovery programs, including the Tribal HUD-VASH program and the Native American Housing Block Grant (NAHBG). The report concludes by noting the ongoing interest in these issues and the potential for legislative action in the 116th Congress.

The LWCF Act authorizes the fund to receive $900 million annually, with the monies available only if appropriated by Congress (i.e., discretionary appropriations). The fund also receives mandatory appropriations under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (GOMESA). The level of annual appropriations for the LWCF has varied since the origin of the fund in FY1965. The LWCF Act outlines uses of the fund for federal and state purposes. Of the total made available through appropriations or deposits under GOMESA, not less than 40% is to be used for \"federal purposes\" and not less than 40% is to be used to provide \"financial assistance to states.\" The act lists the federal purposes for which the President is to allot LWCF funds \"unless otherwise allotted in the appropriation Act making them available.\" These purposes primarily relate to acquisition of lands and waters (and interests therein) by the federal government. With regard to state purposes, the act authorizes a matching grant program to states for outdoor recreation purposes. Throughout the LWCF's history, appropriations acts typically have provided funds for land acquisition and outdoor recreational grants to states. Beginning in FY1998, appropriations also have been provided each year (except FY1999) to fund other purposes related to natural resources. The extent to which the LWCF should be used for purposes other than federal land acquisition and outdoor recreation grants to states, and which other purposes should be funded from the LWCF, continue to be the subject of legislation and debate in Congress. In the past few decades, Presidents have sought LWCF funds for a variety of other purposes. Congress chooses which if any of these requests to fund, and has chosen programs not sought by the President for a particular year. Among other programs, appropriations have been provided for facility maintenance of the land management agencies, ecosystem restoration, the Historic Preservation Fund, the Payments in Lieu of Taxes program, the Forest Legacy Program, State and Tribal Wildlife Grants (under the Fish and Wildlife Service), the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund, U.S. Geological Survey science and cooperative programs, and Bureau of Indian Affairs Indian Land and Water Claim Settlements. Since FY1998, a total of $2.7 billion has been appropriated for other purposes, of a total LWCF appropriation of $18.9 billion over the history of the fund. The Fish and Wildlife Service and the Forest Service have received the largest shares of the total appropriations for other purposes, about $1.4 billion (53%) and $1.0.billion (38%), respectively, from FY1998 to FY2019. Several agencies shared the remaining $0.2 billion (9%) of the appropriations. Both the dollar amounts and the percentages of annual LWCF appropriations for other purposes have varied widely since FY1998. The dollar amounts have ranged from $0 in FY1999 to $456.0 million in FY2001. The percentage of annual funds provided for other purposes ranged from 0% in FY1999 to a high of 59% in both FY2006 and FY2007. In some years, the appropriation for other purposes was significantly less than the Administration requested. For instance, for FY2008, the George W. Bush Administration sought $313.1 million; the appropriation was $101.3 million. The appropriation for other purposes last exceeded $100.0 million in FY2010, and most recently was $93.3 million, in FY2019. Prior to FY2008, several other purposes typically were funded each year from LWCF. Since FY2008, funds have been appropriated annually only for grants under two programs: Forest Legacy and Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund.

This report examines: (1) how WMATA spent its capital funds from fiscal years 2011 through 2017, (2) how WMATA's new capital planning process addresses weaknesses it identified in the prior process, and (3) WMATA's progress toward its track preventive maintenance program's goals and how the program aligns with leading program management practices. GAO analyzed WMATA's financial and program information, interviewed officials of WMATA, the Federal Transit Administration, and five transit agencies selected for similarities to WMATA. GAO compared WMATA's capital planning process and track maintenance program with leading practices. From fiscal years 2011 through 2017, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) spent almost $6 billion on a variety of capital assets, with the largest share spent on improving its rail and bus fleet (see figure). Over this period, WMATA's capital spending was, on average, about $845 million annually. WMATA's new capital planning process could address some weaknesses it identified in the prior process. WMATA established a framework for quantitatively prioritizing capital needs (investments to a group of related assets) over a 10-year period. However, WMATA has not established documented policies and procedures for implementing the new process, such as those for selecting specific projects for funding in its annual capital budget. WMATA is currently using its new capital planning process to make fiscal year 2020 investment decisions. WMATA has proposed a fiscal year 2020 capital budget of $1.4 billion. Without documented policies and procedures for implementing the new planning process, WMATA's stakeholders do not have reasonable assurance that WMATA is following a sound process for making investment decisions. WMATA has made significant progress toward its track preventive maintenance program's goals, which are to reduce both track-defect and electrical-fire incidents by 50 percent in fiscal year 2019 compared with 2017. In fiscal year 2018, WMATA met its goal for reducing track defect incidents and reduced electrical fire incidents by 20 percent. However, in designing the program, WMATA did not fully assess risks. For example, WMATA did not quantitatively assess the impact of track defects or electrical fires on its ability to provide service, nor did it consider other risks such as non-electrical track fires, which represent about 30 percent of all fires on the system, or other factors, such as resources or track time. Without a comprehensive risk assessment, WMATA lacks reasonable assurance that the program is designed to address risks affecting the safety of the rail system or other risks that could hinder the new program's success. GAO is making five recommendations, including that WMATA establish documented policies and procedures for the new capital planning process and conduct a comprehensive risk assessment for the track preventive maintenance program.

{"pred": " \n\nThe Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 mandates that federal agencies promptly report excess personal property to the General Services Administration (GSA) and dispose of it according to GSA regulations. Agencies are required to use existing property or obtain excess property from other federal agencies before purchasing new property. The GSA manages the disposal process, which includes transferring property to other federal agencies, donating it, selling it, or abandoning or destroying it. Agencies often declare property as excess due to office moves, consolidations, or lifecycle replacements. However, agencies do not systematically assess property for continued need, relying instead on triggering events. This lack of proactive assessment can lead to inefficient use of resources and missed opportunities for cost savings. The GSA encourages agencies to use its automated process for disposing of excess property via GSAXcess, which requires manual data entry but allows for detailed descriptions and multiple photos. Agencies can also seek assistance from GSA in disposing of property, especially during space reduction projects like the Freeze the Footprint and Reduce the Footprint initiatives. Despite challenges, agencies generally manage to dispose of excess property effectively. However, the absence of systematic processes for identifying unneeded property can result in retained property that could be better utilized elsewhere. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) could issue guidance to emphasize the importance of continuous property assessment and ensure that unneeded property is made available to others. The GSA and OMB have recognized the need for better property management but face limitations in their authority to enforce these practices.

GAO was asked to review how federal agencies identify and dispose of unneeded personal property. This report examines (1) how selected agencies assess whether personal property is needed and (2) how these agencies dispose of unneeded property and how, if at all, space reduction efforts have affected disposals. GAO reviewed federal statutes and regulations, and selected five agencies—EPA, Forest Service, GSA, HUD, and IRS—mainly based on space reduction results and goals. GAO reviewed these agencies' property disposal data for 2012 through 2016 and interviewed headquarters and field staff about their property management and disposal processes.

Without such policies or processes, agencies may not be routinely identifying unneeded property that could be used elsewhere, and efforts to maximize federal personal property use and minimize unnecessary storage costs may not be effective. GSA has issued regulations establishing a government-wide disposal process for unneeded personal property. However, according to GSA officials, the agency lacks the authority to promulgate regulations or formal guidance on management of in-use agency property, and there is no government-wide guidance to agencies on identifying unneeded personal property. Agencies are required to have internal control activities—such as policies and procedures—for reasonable assurance of efficient operations and minimal resource waste, and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provides guidance to agencies on implementing such activities. Guidance from OMB that emphasizes agencies' internal control responsibilities could help ensure that agencies are proactively and regularly identifying property that is no longer needed. The selected agencies reported little difficulty in following GSA's personal property disposal process, reporting over 37,000 items as unneeded property in fiscal years 2012 through 2016. This property was disposed of through transfers to other agencies, donations to authorized recipients, sales, or discarding. When disposing of personal property from space reduction projects at locations GAO visited, agencies also reported using GSA's process (see figure). Overall, agencies said they have not experienced major challenges with disposing of personal property from space reduction efforts. This lack of challenges could be because projects are geographically dispersed and spread over several years. OMB should provide guidance to executive agencies on managing their personal property, emphasizing that agencies' policies or processes should reflect the requirement to continuously review and identify unneeded personal property. OMB did not comment on GAO's recommendation."], "length": 12375}

{"pred": " \n\nPassage 1 discusses the evolution of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) and its role in ensuring U.S. energy security. The passage highlights that due to increased domestic oil production and stable consumption, the U.S. is projected to become a net exporter of crude oil and petroleum products by the late 2020s, thereby eliminating the need for a 90-day reserve obligation based on net imports. However, the U.S. would still be required to meet the IEA obligation to release reserves in response to supply disruptions. The SPR, owned by the federal government and managed by DOE, stores crude oil in salt caverns along the Gulf Coast, with a current capacity of 713.5 million barrels. The passage notes that the SPR has faced challenges due to aging infrastructure, with a growing backlog of maintenance needs and equipment failures. It also mentions the existence of two regional petroleum product reserves: the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve and the Northeast Gasoline Supply Reserve. The SPR plays a crucial role in meeting the IEA 90-day reserve obligation, but the U.S. relies on a combination of public and private reserves to fulfill this requirement. The passage identifies several limitations in the current SPR management, including the lack of a formal policy for periodic reevaluation, the absence of a cost-benefit analysis of different SPR sizes, and the need for additional regional petroleum product reserves to address domestic supply disruptions. The report recommends that the Department of Energy (DOE) conduct additional analysis, periodically review the SPR, and study the costs and benefits of regional petroleum product reserves. The passage concludes by noting that the SPR modernization plans are based on outdated information and that the uncertainty surrounding future congressionally mandated oil sales complicates long-term planning. Key evidence includes the projected decline in net imports and the current SPR capacity, while unique points include the need for a long-term target for the SPR's size and configuration and the potential for using excess SPR assets through leasing or ticket arrangements. The report emphasizes the importance of addressing these issues to ensure the SPR remains effective and efficient in meeting U.S. energy security needs and international obligations. The passage also highlights the challenges in managing the SPR due to aging infrastructure and the need for modernization, which is constrained by the uncertainty of future oil sales and the lack of a comprehensive strategic review. The report recommends that the Department of Energy (DOE) take steps to address these challenges, including conducting additional analysis, periodically reviewing the SPR, and studying the costs and benefits of regional petroleum product reserves", "answers": ["More than 4 decades ago, Congress authorized the creation of the SPR to reduce the impact of disruptions in supplies of petroleum products. DOE manages the SPR. As a member of the International Energy Agency, the United States is obligated to maintain reserves equivalent to at least 90 days of the previous year's net imports (imports minus exports). The SPR's storage and related infrastructure is aging, and DOE has plans to modernize these facilities. Since 2015, Congress has mandated crude oil sales. As of March 2018, the SPR held about 665 million barrels of crude oil. GAO was asked to examine the SPR's ability to meet U.S. energy security needs. This report examines, among other things, the extent to which (1) DOE has identified the optimal size of the SPR, and (2) DOE's plans for modernizing the SPR take into account the effects of congressionally mandated crude oil sales. GAO reviewed DOE's plans and studies, and interviewed agency officials and nine experts selected based on prior work, referrals, and a literature review. The Department of Energy (DOE) has not identified the optimal size of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). In 2016, DOE completed a long-term strategic review of the SPR after its last comprehensive examination conducted in 2005. The 2016 review examined the benefits of several SPR sizes, but it did not identify an optimal size and its review was limited in several ways. In particular, DOE did not fully consider recent and expected future changes in market conditions, such as the implications of falling net imports, or the role that increased levels of private reserves (reserves held by private companies for their own purposes) may play in responding to supply disruptions. These changes have contributed to SPR and private reserves reaching historically high levels on a net imports basis (see figure). These changes are expected to continue to evolve—according to government projections, the United States will become a net exporter in the late 2020s before again becoming a net importer between 2040 and 2050. GAO has found that agencies should reexamine their programs if conditions change. Without addressing the limitations of its 2016 review and periodically performing reexaminations in the future, DOE cannot be assured that the SPR will be sized appropriately into the future. DOE has taken steps to take into account congressionally mandated sales of SPR crude oil in its $1.4 billion modernization plans for SPR's infrastructure and facilities. The SPR is projected to hold 405 million barrels of oil by the end of fiscal year 2027. However, DOE's current plans are based on information analyzed prior to recently mandated sales. According to DOE officials, the agency began a study in March 2018 to assess the effects of these sales on the SPR's modernization. However, this study is not examining all options for handling any excess SPR assets that may be created by currently mandated sales or any additional sales that may be mandated in the future, inconsistent with an agency order on real property asset management that calls for identifying excess assets. For example, DOE does not plan to examine the potential to lease unused SPR storage capacity to the private sector because DOE is not currently authorized to enter into such leases, according to agency officials. If authorized, leasing capacity could generate revenues that could help offset the costs of modernization. By not examining a full range of options, DOE risks missing beneficial ways to modernize the SPR while saving taxpayer resources. GAO is making four recommendations, including that DOE (1) supplement the 2016 review by conducting an additional analysis, (2) ensure that the agency periodically reexamines the size of the SPR, and (3) consider a full range of options for handling potentially excess assets as it conducts its study, among other things. DOE agreed with two, partially agreed with one, and disagreed with another recommendation on refined product reserve studies. GAO maintains that the recommendations are valid."], "length": 12706}

The House can debate and amend bills in Committee of the Whole, which offers more flexibility in the amending process compared to the House itself. The House uses various modes of consideration for bills, with \"suspension of the rules\" being the most common for quickly passing bills with overwhelming support. The process of resolving differences between the House and Senate involves either exchanging amendments or creating a conference committee. The House can also use unanimous consent or special rules to bypass some of its usual procedures.

On a day-to-day basis, however, the House can also decide to grant individual bills privileged access to the floor, using one of several parliamentary mechanisms. The standing rules of the House include several different parliamentary mechanisms that the body may use to act on bills and resolutions. Which of these will be employed in a given instance usually depends on the extent to which Members want to debate and amend the legislation. In general, all of the procedures of the House permit a majority of Members to work their will without excessive delay. The House considers most legislation by motions to suspend the rules, with limited debate and no floor amendments, with the support of at least two-thirds of the Members voting. Occasionally, the House will choose to consider a measure on the floor by the unanimous consent of Members. The Rules Committee is instrumental in recommending procedures for considering major bills and may propose restrictions on the floor amendments that Members can offer or bar them altogether. Many major bills are first considered in Committee of the Whole before being passed by a simple majority vote of the House. The Committee of the Whole is governed by more flexible procedures than the basic rules of the House, under which a majority can vote to pass a bill after only one hour of debate and with no floor amendments. Although a quorum is supposed to be present on the floor when the House is conducting business, the House assumes a quorum is present unless a quorum call or electronically recorded vote demonstrates that it is not. However, the standing rules preclude quorum calls at most times other than when the House is voting. Questions are first decided by voice vote, although any Member may then demand a division vote. Before the final result of a voice or division vote is announced, Members can secure an electronically recorded vote instead if enough Members desire it or if a quorum is not present in the House. The constitutional requirements for making law mean that each chamber must pass the same measure with the identical text before transmitting it to the President for his consideration. When the second chamber of Congress amends a measure sent to it by the first chamber, the two chambers must resolve legislative differences to meet this requirement. This can be accomplished by shuttling the bill back and forth between the House and Senate, with each chamber proposing amendments to the position of the other, or by establishing a conference committee to try to negotiate a compromise version of the legislation."], "length": 14009}

Specifically, the VA medical centers failed to document almost half of the required reviews and did not initiate reviews for some providers in a timely manner. Key evidence includes the lack of documentation for 26 providers undergoing focused professional practice evaluations (FPPEs for cause) and 8 providers undergoing retrospective reviews. Additionally, the report notes that VHA policy does not mandate documentation for all types of reviews and does not establish timeliness requirements for initiating reviews. The inadequate oversight by VHA networks exacerbates these issues, as they do not routinely ensure that all reviews are conducted and documented. The report recommends that VHA require documentation of all reviews, establish timeliness requirements, and strengthen oversight by requiring networks to monitor VA medical centers. Furthermore, the report reveals that only one of nine providers who faced adverse privileging actions or resigned during the review period was reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) and state licensing boards, despite documented significant clinical deficiencies. This non-reporting is attributed to a lack of familiarity with VHA policies and inadequate oversight by VHA networks. The report concludes that VHA's failure to report providers to the NPDB and state licensing boards facilitates the movement of substandard providers to other facilities, and recommends that VHA require networks to establish a process for timely reporting to these entities. The report underscores the importance of robust oversight and documentation to ensure patient safety and maintain high standards of care in VA medical centers.

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (VAMC) officials are responsible for reviewing the clinical care delivered by their privileged providers—physicians and dentists who are approved to independently perform specific services—after concerns are raised. The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care.

{"pred": " \n\nThe passage discusses the Fire Management Assistance Grant (FMAG) system established under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. FMAGs provide federal assistance for fire suppression activities on public or private forest land or grassland. The system was established in 2001 and is managed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). States can request FMAGs when a fire is out of control and threatens to become a major disaster. Requests are evaluated based on criteria such as the threat to lives and property, the availability of state and local fire resources, and high fire danger conditions. Fire cost thresholds are used to determine eligibility for assistance, with individual and cumulative thresholds varying by state. Tribes are also eligible to request FMAGs, but they do not have to pay the 25% cost-share required of states. The process for requesting and appealing FMAGs is outlined, and the funding for FMAGs comes from FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund. The passage also mentions that FMAGs are similar to other FEMA assistance in that they do not replicate or displace the work of other federal agencies and do not pay straight-time salaries for public safety forces, but they do reimburse overtime expenses. Additionally, the passage explains that FMAGs can be used in conjunction with other federal assistance programs, such as those provided by the Forest Service, but not in conjunction with emergency suppression assistance from the Forest Service. The passage concludes by noting that most fires that begin on federal land are the responsibility of the federal agency that owns or manages the land, and are not eligible for FMAG assistance, with some exceptions for fires on mixed federal and non-federal land where the state has a responsibility for suppression activities. Key evidence includes the fire cost thresholds, which vary by state, and the criteria used to evaluate wildfire requests. Unique points include the fact that tribes are treated equivalently to states in their ability to request FMAGs, and the requirement that states pay a 25% cost-share, while tribes do not. The passage also highlights the importance of the linear no-threshold model in determining radiation risks and the challenges in accurately estimating cancer risks from very low doses of radiation exposure. The passage emphasizes the need for interagency collaboration to address research priorities related to the health effects of low-dose radiation, with the Department of Energy (DOE) being well-positioned to lead such an effort.

The conflicts 2001 to the present have greatly increased the number of Purple Hearts awarded to servicemembers. Events over the past few years have spurred debate on the eligibility criteria for the Purple Heart. Shootings on U.S. soil and medical conditions such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have prompted changes to the eligibility requirements for the Purple Heart. Some critics believe that these changes may lessen the value of the medal and the sacrifices of past recipients on the battlefield. In the past, efforts to modify the Purple Heart's eligibility requirements were contentious, and veterans groups were vocal concerning eligibility changes. While medal requirements are often left to the military and executive branch to decide, Congress is involved in Purple Heart eligibility, utilizing its constitutional power \"To Make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces\" (U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 8, clause 14). The Carl Levin and Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 (P.L. 113-291) included language that expands eligibility for the Purple Heart. Previous debates have raised several questions about the Purple Heart. In some respects, how an event is defined can determine eligibility: Is a servicemember the victim of a crime or a terrorist attack? Conversely, arguing that killed or wounded servicemembers \"should\" be eligible for the Purple Heart can redefine an event: Is the servicemember an advisor to a foreign military or a combatant? Are PTSD and other mental health conditions adequate injuries to warrant the Purple Heart? These are questions that Congress might consider if it chooses to act on this issue."], "length": 14330}
{"pred": " \n\nThe Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) Act of 1965 aims to promote outdoor recreation and enhance public health by providing funds for federal land acquisition and state assistance. The fund receives $900 million annually, primarily from oil and gas leases on the Outer Continental Shelf, but actual appropriations depend on Congress. Since its inception, less than half of the accrued funds have been appropriated, leaving a significant unappropriated balance. The LWCF Act specifies that at least 40% of funds should be used for federal land acquisition and 40% for state grants. Historically, appropriations have been directed towards land acquisition, state grants, and other purposes. Other purposes include funding for maintenance needs, ecosystem restoration, and various natural resource-related programs. From FY1998 to FY2019, $2.7 billion was appropriated for other purposes, accounting for 27% of total LWCF appropriations. Key programs receiving funding include the Forest Legacy Program, Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund, and State and Tribal Wildlife Grants. The report highlights the variability in annual appropriations for other purposes and the ongoing debate over the fund's allocation. Congress continues to consider expanding the fund's use beyond traditional land acquisition and state grants, with some advocating for broader funding to address diverse natural resource needs. The LWCF's flexibility allows presidents to seek funding for a wide range of natural resource-related initiatives, subject to congressional approval. The unappropriated balance of $22.0 billion underscores the potential for increased funding if Congress chooses to allocate more of the accrued revenues. The report concludes by noting the importance of balancing traditional LWCF goals with emerging policy priorities and the need for continued legislative attention to ensure the fund's effectiveness. The LWCF's unique structure, combining mandatory and discretionary funding sources, creates opportunities for both targeted and flexible resource allocation. The variability in annual appropriations for other purposes reflects the dynamic nature of natural resource management and the evolving priorities of policymakers. The report emphasizes the need for ongoing dialogue and collaboration between Congress, the executive branch, and stakeholders to optimize the LWCF's impact on outdoor recreation and natural resource conservation. The LWCF's ability to fund a diverse array of programs demonstrates its adaptability and potential to address a broad spectrum of environmental challenges.

The LWCF Act authorizes the fund to receive $900 million annually, with the monies available only if appropriated by Congress (i.e., discretionary appropriations). The fund also receives mandatory appropriations under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (GOMESA). The level of annual appropriations for the LWCF has varied since the origin of the fund in FY1965. The LWCF Act outlines uses of the fund for federal and state purposes. Of the total made available through appropriations or deposits under GOMESA, not less than 40% is to be used for \"federal purposes\" and not less than 40% is to be used to provide \"financial assistance to states.\" The act lists the federal purposes for which the President is to allot LWCF funds \"unless otherwise allotted in the appropriation Act making them available.\" These purposes primarily relate to acquisition of lands and waters (and interests therein) by the federal government. With regard to state purposes, the act authorizes a matching grant program to states for outdoor recreation purposes. Throughout the LWCF's history, appropriations acts typically have provided funds for land acquisition and outdoor recreational grants to states. Beginning in FY1998, appropriations also have been provided each year (except FY1999) to fund other purposes related to natural resources. The extent to which the LWCF should be used for purposes other than federal land acquisition and outdoor recreation grants to states, and which other purposes should be funded from the LWCF, continue to be the subject of legislation and debate in Congress. In the past few decades, Presidents have sought LWCF funds for a variety of other purposes. Congress chooses which if any of these requests to fund, and has chosen programs not sought by the President for a particular year. Among other programs, appropriations have been provided for facility maintenance of the land management agencies, ecosystem restoration, the Historic Preservation Fund, the Payments in Lieu of Taxes program, the Forest Legacy Program, State and Tribal Wildlife Grants (under the Fish and Wildlife Service), the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund, U.S. Geological Survey science and cooperative programs, and Bureau of Indian Affairs Indian Land and Water Claim Settlements. Since FY1998, a total of $2.7 billion has been appropriated for other purposes, of a total LWCF appropriation of $18.9 billion over the history of the fund. The Fish and Wildlife Service and the Forest Service have received the largest shares of the total appropriations for other purposes, about $1.4 billion (53%) and $1.0.billion (38%), respectively, from FY1998 to FY2019. Several agencies shared the remaining $0.2 billion (9%) of the appropriations. Both the dollar amounts and the percentages of annual LWCF appropriations for other purposes have varied widely since FY1998. The dollar amounts have ranged from $0 in FY1999 to $456.0 million in FY2001. The percentage of annual funds provided for other purposes ranged from 0% in FY1999 to a high of 59% in both FY2006 and FY2007. In some years, the appropriation for other purposes was significantly less than the Administration requested. For instance, for FY2008, the George W. Bush Administration sought $313.1 million; the appropriation was $101.3 million. The appropriation for other purposes last exceeded $100.0 million in FY2010, and most recently was $93.3 million, in FY2019. Prior to FY2008, several other purposes typically were funded each year from LWCF.

GAO was asked to review U.S. assistance to these four organizations. In this report, GAO (1) assesses the extent to which the organizations' strategic goals align with those of U.S. agencies; (2) examines how the organizations oversee the use of their funds and the extent to which U.S. agencies have supported those efforts; (3) assesses the extent to which U.S. agencies included key monitoring provisions as part of assistance agreements; and (4) assesses the extent to which U.S. agencies had documentation of monitoring activities, including those called for by these provisions. GAO analyzed documents and interviewed officials from State, USAID, HHS, USDA, and the organizations. GAO also analyzed a nongeneralizable sample of 12 of the 60 assistance agreements that were awarded by State, USAID, HHS, and USDA to OAS, PAHO, and IICA and were active during calendar years 2014 through 2016. For each agency, GAO selected three agreements with the lowest, median, and highest dollar value. GAO found that strategic goals of the Organization of American States (OAS), the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA), and the Pan-American Institute of Geography and History (PAIGH) are predominantly aligned with the strategic goals of the Department of State (State), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). For example, IICA's strategic goals of a productive agricultural sector, enhancing agricultural development, and food security are aligned with USDA's foreign assistance goals. State, USAID, HHS, and USDA fund activities in the form of assistance agreements (e.g., grants and cooperative agreements) with OAS, PAHO, and IICA, which in 2016 totaled $32 million. According to agency officials, the agencies employ mechanisms to ensure that these agreements align with U.S. strategic goals. OAS, PAHO, IICA, and PAIGH have established mechanisms for overseeing their use of funds, such as external auditors, internal audit boards, and anti-fraud and ethics policies. State and USDA have directly supported these mechanisms. For example, State engaged in the selection process for OAS's Inspector General. GAO's review of 12 selected assistance agreements found that USDA included no financial or performance monitoring provisions in one of its agreements and that State did not include two key monitoring provisions in one of its agreements, called for by applicable guidance. GAO found that the remaining 10 agreements it reviewed contained all key monitoring provisions and that State has since taken corrective action. GAO found that U.S. agencies did not have full documentation of 18 of the 42 monitoring activities required by the 12 assistance agreements GAO reviewed (see table). For example, USDA did not have full documentation, such as for financial reports, of any of its 10 required monitoring activities and USDA officials did not explain their lack of documentation. USAID officials explained that their lack of full documentation was due, in part, to grant officers not always following their document management policies. State and HHS have since taken corrective action. If an agency does not have full documentation of monitoring activities, it may lack information needed to make appropriate budgetary and programmatic decisions.

{"pred": " \n\nThe passage discusses challenges faced by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in aligning its services and real property portfolio to meet the needs of veterans. Key issues include geographic shifts in the veterans' population, changes in healthcare delivery, an aging infrastructure, and limited stakeholder involvement. VA faces difficulties in modernizing, renovating, and retrofitting older facilities, with many buildings being vacant or underutilized. Historical status complicates conversions or disposals, and some buildings are designated as historic, making demolition impractical. VA's planning processes, such as Strategic Capital Investment Planning (SCIP) and VA Integrated Planning (VAIP), have limitations, including subjective narratives, long timeframes, and restricted access to information. These limitations hinder VA's ability to accurately identify capital needs and align facilities with veterans' needs. VA has not consistently engaged stakeholders, leading to adversarial relationships that impede facility alignment efforts. The passage also draws lessons from the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process used by the Department of Defense (DOD) to improve VA's approach to facility realignment. The BRAC process involved establishing goals, criteria, an organizational structure, a common analytical framework, oversight mechanisms, and stakeholder involvement. The DOD's BRAC process faced challenges, such as the need for sustained senior leadership attention and coordination among stakeholders, and the complexity of interdependent recommendations. These insights suggest that VA could benefit from adopting a structured, transparent, and stakeholder-inclusive approach to align its facilities and services with veterans' needs. The passage highlights the importance of addressing these challenges to ensure that VA's facilities and services remain effective and efficient in serving veterans. The key evidence includes VA's facility inventory data, historical preservation concerns, and the limitations of its planning processes. Unique points include the comparison with the DOD's BRAC process and the emphasis on the need for stakeholder engagement and coordination.

DOD has repeatedly applied the BRAC process to reduce the amount of unneeded property that it owns and leases and to save billions of dollars that could be applied to higher priority defense needs. This statement is based on GAO's April 2017 report related to VA facility alignment ( GAO-17-349 ) and numerous GAO reports related to the BRAC process as summarized in a June 2011 testimony ( GAO-11-704T ) and a March 2012 testimony ( GAO-12-513T ). This statement addresses (1) the factors that affect VA's facility alignment and the extent to which VA's capital-planning process facilitates the alignment of facilities with the veterans' population, and (2) the key elements and challenges affecting DOD and the Commission in BRAC 2005. Detailed information on our scope and methodologies for this work can be found in these published products, cited throughout this testimony. Geographic shifts in the veterans' population, changes in health care delivery, aging infrastructure, and limited stakeholder involvement affect the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) efforts to align its services and real property portfolio to meet the needs of veterans. For example, a shift over time from inpatient to outpatient care will likely result in underutilized space once used for inpatient care. Further, the historic status of some VA facilities adds to the complexity of converting or disposing of them. In such instances, it is often difficult and costly for VA to modernize, renovate, and retrofit these older facilities. GAO reported that two of the planning processes VA uses to align its facilities—VA's Strategic Capital Investment Planning (SCIP) and the VA Integrated Planning (VAIP)—have limitations that undermine VA's efforts to achieve its goals. Specifically: VA relies on the SCIP process to plan and prioritize capital projects, but VA routinely asks its facility planners to submit their next year's planned project narratives before knowing if their previous submissions have been funded. The overlapping budget cycle, which is outside of VA's control, combined with other SCIP limitations—including subjective narratives, long time frames, and restricted access to information—make it difficult for VA to rely on SCIP to accurately identify the capital necessary to address its service and infrastructure gaps. VA concurred that it needs to address SCIP limitations that are within its control, as GAO recommended; VA has made some progress in implementing the recommendation has made some progress in implementing the recommendation.\\ The VAIP process is estimated to cost $108 million and to produce market-level service delivery plans and facility master plans. However, the VAIP master plans incorrectly assume that all future growth in services will be provided directly through VA facilities without considering alternatives, such as purchasing care from the community. GAO recommended that VA consider discontinuing the VAIP facility master plans pending an assessment of their value as a facility-planning tool. VA agreed with the recommendation and is implementing it while pursuing a national realignment strategy.. Key elements of the Department of Defense's (DOD) 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process could benefit VA's asset and infrastructure review. The key elements included: (1) establishing goals for the process, (2) developing criteria for evaluating closures and realignments, and (3) establishing an organizational structure to develop closure and realignment options. GAO identified key challenges that affected DOD's implementation of BRAC 2005 and the results achieved; these challenges would need to be addressed if VA is to successfully apply the process. These challenges included: (1) large, complex recommendations required sustained senior leadership's attention and a high level of coordination among many stakeholders, and (2) the large number of actions that depend on each other for successful implementation. In the April 2017 report, GAO made recommendations related to capital planning and stakeholder involvement.

{"pred": " \n\nThe passage discusses the long-term fiscal outlook for state and local governments in the United States. Key findings indicate that state and local governments will likely face persistent fiscal challenges over the next 50 years due to a growing gap between expenditures and revenues. This gap is primarily driven by rising healthcare costs, particularly Medicaid spending, and the need to maintain pension obligations. The report projects that the fiscal gap, defined as the amount of reductions in expenditures needed to prevent negative operating balances, is about 14.7% of total expenditures or 2.4% of GDP. The passage highlights that while some types of expenditures, such as wages and salaries, are projected to grow more slowly than GDP, healthcare spending is expected to increase significantly. Additionally, the report notes that federal grants, especially Medicaid grants, are likely to grow more quickly than other types of federal grants, contributing to the fiscal imbalance. The passage also discusses the impact of recent federal policy changes, such as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, on state and local government finances. Lastly, the report emphasizes that economic growth, health care cost growth, and the rate of return on pension assets are critical determinants of the state and local government sector's fiscal balance, and that changes in these variables could significantly affect future fiscal outcomes. The methodology employed involves using historical data and projections from various sources to simulate the state and local government sector's revenues and expenditures over a 75-year period, providing a comprehensive assessment of the fiscal outlook. The report concludes that maintaining fiscal balance would require significant reductions in spending relative to current policies. The unique aspect of the report lies in its detailed modeling approach and the use of alternative scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the fiscal outlook to different economic and policy assumptions. The report also underscores the importance of considering the long-term fiscal challenges faced by state and local governments in policy-making and planning. The key evidence includes projections from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the Board of Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and Federal Disability Insurance Trust Funds (OASDI Trustees), the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), and the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). The report's innovative approach is its comprehensive simulation model that incorporates various economic and policy variables to forecast the state and local government sector's fiscal balance over a long-term horizon. The report also highlights the potential impacts of federal policy changes and economic variables on the fiscal outlook, providing a nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between fiscal policy and economic conditions", "answers": ["Fiscal sustainability presents a national challenge shared by all levels of government. Since 2007, GAO has published simulations of long-term fiscal trends in the state and local government sector, which have consistently shown that the sector faces long-term fiscal pressures. While most states have requirements related to balancing their budgets, deficits can arise because the planned annual revenues are not generated at the expected rate, demand for services exceeds planned expenditures, or both, resulting in a near-term operating deficit. This report updates GAO's state and local fiscal model to simulate the fiscal outlook for the state and local government sector. This includes identifying the components of state and local expenditures likely to contribute to the sector's fiscal pressures. In addition, this report identifies considerations related to federal policy and other factors that could contribute to uncertainties in the state and local government sector's long-term fiscal outlook. GAO's model uses the Bureau of Economic Analysis's National Income and Product Accounts as the primary data source and presents the results in the aggregate for the state and local sector as a whole. The model shows the level of receipts and expenditures for the sector until 2067, based on current and historical spending and revenue patterns. In addition, the model assumes that the current set of policies in place across state and local government remains constant to show a simulated long-term outlook. GAO's simulations suggest that the state and local government sector will likely face an increasing difference between revenues and expenditures during the next 50 years as reflected by the operating balance--a measure of the sector's ability to cover its current expenditures out of its current receipts. While both expenditures and revenues are projected to increase as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), a difference between the two is projected to persist because expenditures are expected to grow faster than revenues throughout the simulation period. GAO's simulations also suggest that growth in the sector's overall spending is largely driven by health care expenditures--in particular, Medicaid spending and spending on health benefits for state and local government employees and retirees. These expenditures are projected to grow as a share of GDP during the simulation period. GAO's simulations also suggest that revenues from personal income taxes and federal grants to states and localities will increase during the simulation period. However, revenues will grow more slowly than expenditures such that the sector faces a declining fiscal outlook. GAO also identified federal policy changes that could affect the state and local government sector's fiscal outlook. For example, the effects of the recently-enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will likely depend on how states incorporate the Act into their state income tax rules.

From October 2013 to March 2017, five VA medical centers reviewed 148 providers for clinical care concerns but failed to document 46% of these reviews. Additionally, the VA medical centers did not initiate reviews of 16 providers for up to three months after concerns were raised. The report attributes these issues to inadequate documentation and timeliness requirements, as well as insufficient oversight by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Recommendations include requiring documentation of all reviews, establishing timeliness requirements, and strengthening oversight by the VHA. The report also highlights instances where providers with significant clinical deficiencies were not reported to the NPDB or state licensing boards, potentially allowing them to continue practicing elsewhere. The VA concurred with the recommendations and plans to implement changes. The report underscores the importance of robust oversight mechanisms to ensure patient safety and accountability in healthcare delivery. Key evidence includes documentation gaps and delays in conducting reviews, as well as examples of unreported providers who continued to practice.

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (VAMC) officials are responsible for reviewing the clinical care delivered by their privileged providers—physicians and dentists who are approved to independently perform specific services—after concerns are raised. The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care. For example, GAO found that after one VAMC failed to report to the NPDB or SLBs a provider who resigned to avoid an adverse privileging action, a non-VA hospital in the same city took an adverse privileging action against that same provider for the same reason 2 years later."], "length": 13615}

Anecdotal reporting and certain analyses suggest that businesses and consumers are increasingly eschewing cash payments in favor of electronic payment methods. Such trends have led analysts and policymakers to examine the possibility that the use and acceptance of cash will significantly decline in coming years and to consider the effects of such an evolution. Cash is still a common and widely accepted payment system in the United States. Cash's advantages include its simplicity and robustness as a payment system that requires no ancillary technologies. In addition, it provides privacy in transactions and protection from cyber threats or financial institution failures. However, using cash involves costs to businesses and consumers who pay fees to obtain, manage, and protect cash and exposes its users to loss through misplacement, theft, or accidental destruction of physical currency. Cash also concurrently generates government revenues through \"profits\" earned by producing it and by acting as interest-free liabilities to the Federal Reserve (in contrast to reserve balances on which the Federal Reserve pays interest), while reducing government revenues by facilitating some tax avoidance. The relative advantages and costs of various payment methods will largely determine whether and to what degree electronic payment systems will displace cash. Traditional noncash payment systems (such as credit and debit cards and interbank clearing systems) involving intermediaries such as banks and central banks address some of the shortcomings of cash payments. These systems can execute payments over physical distance, allow businesses and consumers to avoid some of the costs and risks of using cash, and are run by generally trusted and closely regulated intermediaries. However, the maintenance and operation of legacy noncash systems involve their own costs, and the intermediaries charge fees to recoup those costs and earn profits. The time it takes to finalize certain transactions—including crediting customer accounts for check or electronic deposits—can lead to consumers incurring additional costs. In addition, these systems involve cybersecurity risks and generally require customers to divulge their private personal information to gain system access, which raises privacy concerns. To date, the migration away from cash has largely been in favor of traditional noncash payment systems; however, some observers predict new alternative systems will play a larger role in the future. Such alternative systems aim to address some of the inefficiencies and risks of traditional noncash systems, but face obstacles to achieving that aim and involve costs of their own. Private systems using distributed ledger technology, such as cryptocurrencies, may not serve the main functions of money well and face challenges to widespread acceptance and technological scalability. These systems also raise concerns among certain observers related to whether these systems could facilitate crime, provide inadequate protections to consumers, and may adversely affect governments' ability to implement or transmit monetary policy. The potential for increased payment efficiency from these systems is promising enough that certain central banks have investigated the possibility of issuing government-backed, electronic-only currencies—called central bank digital currencies (CBDCs)—in such a way that the benefits of certain alternative payment systems could be realized with appropriately mitigated risk. How CBDCs would be created and function are still matters of speculation at this time, and the possibility of their introduction raises questions about the appropriate role of a central bank in the financial system and the economy. If the relative benefits and costs of cash and the various other payment methods evolve in such a way that cash is significantly displaced as a commonly accepted form of payment, that evolution could have a number of effects, both positive and negative, on the economy and society. Proponents of reducing cash usage (or even eliminating it all together and becoming a cashless society) argue that doing so will generate important benefits, including potentially improved efficiency of the payment system, a reduction of crime, and less constrained monetary policy. Proponents of maintaining cash as a payment option argue that significant reductions in cash usage and acceptance would further marginalize people with limited access to the financial system, increase the financial system's vulnerability to cyberattack, and reduce personal privacy. Based on their assessment of the magnitude of these benefits and costs and the likelihood that market forces will displace cash as a payment system, policymakers may choose to encourage or discourage this trend."], "length": 14436}

{"pred": " \n\nThe passage discusses the approach federal agencies take to manage radiation exposure and the research conducted on the health effects of low-dose radiation. Key federal agencies, including the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of Energy (DOE), and Food and Drug Administration (FDA), rely on scientific advisory bodies' recommendations, particularly the linear no-threshold model, to set dose limits for radiation exposure. These limits are below the level considered low dose by the National Academies' 2006 report on radiation and human health. The passage highlights that while there is uncertainty regarding the health effects of very low doses of radiation, federal agencies continue to follow the linear no-threshold model due to the lack of convincing evidence suggesting otherwise. The passage also notes that federal agencies have allocated $209.6 million from 2012 to 2016 for research on the health effects of low-dose radiation, with DOE and NIH accounting for the majority of the funding. Despite this, the agencies did not use a collaborative mechanism to address overall research priorities in this area. The passage concludes by recommending that the Secretary of Energy lead the development of a mechanism for interagency collaboration to determine roles and responsibilities for addressing priorities related to research on the health effects of low-dose radiation. This recommendation stems from the belief that such a mechanism could help reduce uncertainty in predicting cancer risk from low-dose radiation and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of research efforts. The passage emphasizes the importance of collaboration among federal agencies to address shared research priorities in this critical area. The key evidence presented includes the allocation of funds for research, the reliance on the linear no-threshold model, and the lack of a collaborative mechanism among agencies. The unique point made is the recommendation for interagency collaboration to address research priorities, which could lead to more efficient and effective research efforts. The passage also notes that while there is uncertainty regarding the health effects of very low doses of radiation, federal agencies continue to follow the linear no-threshold model due to the lack of convincing evidence suggesting otherwise. This approach underscores the cautious and precautionary stance taken by federal agencies in managing radiation exposure. The passage highlights the need for continued research to better understand the health effects of low-dose radiation and the potential benefits of interagency collaboration in this field.

The Department of Energy (DOE), Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Food and Drug Administration generally used the advice of scientific advisory bodies to develop and apply radiation protection requirements and guidance for workers and the public in the radiation exposure settings that GAO reviewed. These settings were: (1) the operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants; (2) the cleanup of sites with radiological contamination; (3) the use of medical equipment that produces radiation; and (4) accidental or terrorism-related exposure to radiation. Specifically, the agencies relied on the advice of three scientific advisory bodies that supported the use of a model that assumes the risk of cancer increases with every incremental radiation exposure. Accordingly, the agencies have set regulatory dose limits and issued guidance to confine exposure to levels that reduce the risk of cancer, while recognizing that scientific uncertainties occur in estimating cancer risks from low-dose radiation. For example, NRC requires nuclear power plants to consider measures for limiting workers' exposure below NRC's regulatory dose limit, such as by using robots for maintenance work in radiation areas. GAO identified seven federal agencies that funded research on low-dose radiation's health effects. In fiscal years 2012 to 2016, DOE, NRC, EPA, and four other federal agencies obligated about $210 million for such research . Although the agencies have collaborated on individual projects on radiation's health effects, they have not established a collaborative mechanism to set research priorities. GAO's previous work has shown that federal agencies can use such mechanisms to implement interagency collaboration to develop and coordinate sound science policies. In the past, DOE took a leading role in this area because DOE provided stable funding and advocated for greater coordination on research on low-dose radiation's health effects. However, since fiscal year 2012, DOE has phased out funding for one of its main research programs in this area. This has created a void in coordination efforts among federal agencies, and no other agency has stepped forward to fill this void. Because of DOE's prior experience as a leader in this area of research and its research responsibility under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, it could play an important role in helping federal agencies establish a coordinating mechanism for low-dose radiation research.

TANF was created in the 1996 welfare reform law (P.L. 104-193). This report responds to some frequently asked questions about TANF; it does not describe TANF rules (see, instead, CRS Report RL32748, The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Block Grant: A Primer on TANF Financing and Federal Requirements, by Gene Falk). TANF Funding and Expenditures. TANF provides fixed funding for the 50 states, the District of Columbia, the territories, and American Indian tribes. The basic block grant totals $16.5 billion per year. States are also required in total to contribute, from their own funds, at least $10.3 billion annually under a maintenance-of-effort (MOE) requirement. Though TANF is best known for funding cash assistance payments for needy families with children, the block grant and MOE funds are used for a wide variety of benefits and activities. In FY2017, expenditures on basic assistance totaled $7.1 billion—23% of total federal TANF and MOE dollars. Basic assistance is often—but not exclusively—paid as cash. In addition to funding basic assistance, TANF also contributes funds for child care and services for children who have been, or are at risk of being, abused and neglected. Some states also count expenditures in prekindergarten programs toward the MOE requirement. The TANF Assistance Caseload. A total of 1.2 million families, composed of 3.1 million recipients, received TANF- or MOE-funded assistance in September 2018. The bulk of the \"recipients\" were children—2.3 million in that month. The assistance caseload is heterogeneous. The type of family once thought of as the \"typical\" assistance family—one with an unemployed adult recipient—accounted for 32% of all families on the rolls in FY2016. Additionally, 31% of cash assistance families had an employed adult, while 38% of all TANF families were \"child-only\" and had no adult recipient. Child-only families include those with disabled adults receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI), adults who are nonparents (e.g., grandparents, aunts, uncles) caring for children, and families consisting of citizen children and ineligible noncitizen parents. Cash Assistance Benefits. TANF cash benefit amounts are set by states. In July 2017, the maximum monthly benefit for a family of three ranged from $1,021 in New Hampshire to $170 in Mississippi. Only New Hampshire (at 60% of the federal poverty guidelines) had a maximum TANF cash assistance amount for this sized family in excess of 50% of poverty-level income. Work Requirements. TANF's main federal work requirement is actually a performance measure that applies to the states. States determine the work rules that apply to individual recipients. TANF law requires states to engage 50% of all families and 90% of two-parent families with work-eligible individuals in work activities, though these standards can be reduced by \"credits.\" Therefore, the effective standards states face are often less than the 50% or 90% targets, and vary by state. In FY2017, states achieved, on average, an all-family participation rate of 53.0% and a two-parent rate of 69.5%. In FY2017, two jurisdictions did not meet the all-family participation standard: Nevada and Guam. This is a reduction from FY2012, when 16 states did not meet that standard. In FY2017, nine jurisdictions did not meet the two-parent standard. States that do not meet work standards are at risk of being penalized by a reduction in their block grant."], "length": 12574}

Despite accruing $40.9 billion in revenues, only $18.9 billion has been appropriated, leaving an unappropriated balance of $22.0 billion. Since FY1998, the LWCF has funded three main purposes: federal land acquisition, state outdoor recreation grants, and other purposes. The largest share of funds ($11.4 billion) has gone to federal land acquisition, followed by state grants ($4.8 billion). Other purposes have received $2.7 billion, with the highest allocation in FY2001 at $456.0 million.

The fund also receives mandatory appropriations under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (GOMESA). The level of annual appropriations for the LWCF has varied since the origin of the fund in FY1965. The LWCF Act outlines uses of the fund for federal and state purposes. Of the total made available through appropriations or deposits under GOMESA, not less than 40% is to be used for \"federal purposes\" and not less than 40% is to be used to provide \"financial assistance to states.\" The act lists the federal purposes for which the President is to allot LWCF funds \"unless otherwise allotted in the appropriation Act making them available.\" These purposes primarily relate to acquisition of lands and waters (and interests therein) by the federal government. With regard to state purposes, the act authorizes a matching grant program to states for outdoor recreation purposes. Throughout the LWCF's history, appropriations acts typically have provided funds for land acquisition and outdoor recreational grants to states. Beginning in FY1998, appropriations also have been provided each year (except FY1999) to fund other purposes related to natural resources. The extent to which the LWCF should be used for purposes other than federal land acquisition and outdoor recreation grants to states, and which other purposes should be funded from the LWCF, continue to be the subject of legislation and debate in Congress. In the past few decades, Presidents have sought LWCF funds for a variety of other purposes. Congress chooses which if any of these requests to fund, and has chosen programs not sought by the President for a particular year. Among other programs, appropriations have been provided for facility maintenance of the land management agencies, ecosystem restoration, the Historic Preservation Fund, the Payments in Lieu of Taxes program, the Forest Legacy Program, State and Tribal Wildlife Grants (under the Fish and Wildlife Service), the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund, U.S. Geological Survey science and cooperative programs, and Bureau of Indian Affairs Indian Land and Water Claim Settlements.

The Government Accountability Office (GAO) surveyed federal managers in 2017 and found that only a few agencies had statistically significant improvements in their use of performance information. Data-driven reviews, which are required by the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA), have shown positive effects on progress towards agency goals and efficiency.

For example, as shown in the table below, GAO's survey found that managers whose programs were subject to data-driven reviews (regular reviews used to assess progress on select agency goals) to a greater extent reported statistically significantly greater use of performance information to make decisions. The Executive Branch has begun taking steps to improve the use of performance information within agencies and across the government. For example, In the President's Management Agenda and government-wide reform plan, released in March and June 2018 respectively, the administration acknowledged the need to do more, and announced a goal, among other actions, to improve the use of data in federal decision making. However, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and others responsible for this goal have yet to fully develop action plans to hold agencies accountable for achieving it. The Performance Improvement Council (PIC), which is chaired by OMB, has undertaken efforts to improve the use of performance information by, for example, creating a working group on agency performance reviews. But it has not yet taken a systematic approach to identify and share proven practices that led to, or challenges that may be hampering, increased use of performance information by managers. GAO's survey results identified agencies that may have insights into such practices and challenges. More fully developing action plans for the new goal, and identifying and sharing proven practices and challenges, could help ensure the Executive Branch takes further steps to improve the use of performance information by managers within agencies and across the federal government. To improve the use of performance information within agencies and across the federal government, GAO recommends that OMB work with (1) fellow goal leaders to more fully develop action plans for the new goal to improve the use of data and (2) the PIC to prioritize efforts to identify and share proven practices and challenges. OMB had no comments on this report."], "length": 14245}

{"pred": " \nThe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers failed to properly document and timely conduct reviews of providers' clinical care after concerns were raised about their care. From October 2013 to March 2017, out of 148 providers reviewed, documentation was missing for almost half of the required reviews. The VA medical centers also did not always initiate reviews promptly, with some taking up to multiple years to start. Two main factors contributed to these issues: the VA's policy did not require documentation of all types of reviews and did not establish timeliness requirements for initiating reviews. Additionally, the VA's oversight of these reviews was inadequate. The VA medical centers also failed to report nine providers to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) and state licensing boards as required, despite documenting significant clinical deficiencies. This was due to a combination of VA medical center officials' unfamiliarity with or misinterpretation of VHA policies and the VA's failure to require network oversight of NPDB and state licensing board reporting. These failures led to providers who provided substandard care at one VA medical center potentially obtaining privileges at another VA medical center or at hospitals outside of VA's health care system. The VA agreed to address these issues by requiring documentation of all reviews, establishing timeliness requirements, and strengthening oversight through network-level processes. The VA also plans to include oversight of timely reporting to the NPDB and state licensing boards in the standard audit tool used by the networks. These measures aim to improve the VA's ability to ensure that providers who provide substandard care are appropriately managed and reported. The VA's failure to properly document and timely conduct reviews of providers' clinical care and to report providers to the NPDB and state licensing boards as required raises concerns about the quality of care provided to veterans and the VA's accountability for ensuring that substandard care providers are appropriately managed. The VA's inadequate oversight and policy requirements contribute to these issues, highlighting the need for stronger oversight and clearer policy guidelines. The VA's failure to report providers to the NPDB and state licensing boards also facilitates the potential for substandard care providers to obtain privileges at other VA medical centers or hospitals outside of VA's health care system, further compromising the quality of care for veterans.

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (VAMC) officials are responsible for reviewing the clinical care delivered by their privileged providers—physicians and dentists who are approved to independently perform specific services—after concerns are raised. The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care. For example, GAO found that after one VAMC failed to report to the NPDB or SLBs a provider who resigned to avoid an adverse privileging action, a non-VA hospital in the same city took an adverse privileging action against that same provider for the same reason 2 years later."], "length": 13762}
{"pred": " \n\nThe patent describes a method to improve the aqueous solubility and bioavailability of the platinum antitumor complex, bis-acetato-ammine-dichloro-cyclohexylamine-platinum (IV), known as JM216. The primary issue addressed is the poor water-solubility of JM216, which leads to reduced bioavailability and pharmacokinetic variability when administered orally. The inventors discovered that by converting JM216 to an amorphous state through grinding or milling with β-cyclodextrin or certain polymers (gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidinone, or hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose), the solubility of JM216 can be significantly enhanced. Specifically, the amorphous form of JM216 showed a doubling of aqueous solubility compared to the bulk drug form. The patent also discloses a suppository formulation for rectal administration, which utilizes a water-soluble polyethylene glycol (PEG) base and incorporates certain fatty acids (caproic acid, caprylic acid, capric acid, or oleic acid) to further enhance absorption. Surface active agents like Tween 80 or pluronic F68 can also be added to improve the suppository's effectiveness. The optimal formulation includes amorphous JM216, a PEG base, and a fatty acid, with the fatty acid content ranging from 0.5 to 10% (w/w) and the surface active agent content ranging from 0.5 to 7% (w/w). The patent emphasizes that these formulations offer improved bioavailability and reduced side effects compared to oral administration, making them suitable for patients who cannot tolerate oral dosing. Key evidence supporting these claims comes from in vitro drug absorption studies using excised rat rectum, which demonstrated significant absorption rates for the formulated suppositories. The patent highlights the importance of using a water-soluble PEG base and incorporating specific fatty acids to achieve optimal absorption properties. Unique aspects of the invention include the use of amorphous JM216 and the combination of PEG base with fatty acids and surface active agents to create highly effective suppository formulations.

{"pred": " \n\nThis passage discusses the Department of Defense's (DOD) defense lab enterprise, which comprises 63 labs, warfare centers, and engineering centers across the Army, Navy, and Air Force. These labs employ about 50,000 federally employed scientists and engineers to support warfighter needs and develop transformative capabilities. The labs are managed within the military service chain of command and receive funding from the DOD's research, development, test, and evaluation budget, which is divided into seven budget activity categories. The passage highlights the varying funding models used by the military services, with the Air Force and Army relying on mission funding or customer funding, while the Navy operates under the Navy Working Capital Fund. Additionally, the passage explains that DOD sponsors other entities, such as FFRDCs and UARCs, to provide technology development services. The passage concludes by discussing four legislative authorities provided to DOD lab directors to foster innovation and efficiency, including the Laboratory Initiated Research Authority, Direct Hire Authority, Laboratory Enhancement Pilot Program, and Micro-purchase Authority. It notes that while most labs have used these authorities, their usage has sometimes been limited due to various obstacles, such as DOD legal and policy restrictions and stakeholder concerns. The passage also provides details on the usage of these authorities by the labs, including the percentage of funds obligated and the types of projects funded. Finally, the passage outlines the challenges faced by DOD labs in utilizing these authorities, such as limitations on infrastructure funding and inconsistent application of direct hire authority policies. The key evidence presented includes spending data on the use of the laboratory initiated research authority and direct hire data from each of the military services. Unique points include the detailed description of the various funding models and authorities provided to DOD labs, as well as the challenges faced in implementing these authorities. The passage emphasizes the importance of overcoming these obstacles to fully leverage the potential of DOD labs in fostering innovation and efficiency. The passage also highlights the need for DOD to assess and potentially remove barriers to the more effective use of these authorities. The passage concludes by providing recommendations to DOD leadership to address these challenges. The passage also includes a detailed methodology section outlining the scope and approach of the review, including the selection of laboratories for the survey, the data collection methods, and the interviews conducted with officials responsible for the management, execution, and oversight of DOD's science and technology enterprise. The passage also includes a discussion of the governance models used by DOD-sponsored federally funded research centers (FFRDCs) and university affiliated", "answers": ["Congress created several authorities that provide DOD research labs with ways to increase efficiency and foster innovation. Senate report 114-255 contained a provision for GAO to study governance models used by federal labs. This report evaluates DOD labs' use of authorities to foster innovation and efficiency. GAO selected four authorities that recent work on best practices for science and technology management and expedited defense lab hiring have shown to be the most crucial for supporting innovation; administered a survey to 44 lab directors to gain insight into their use of the authorities; interviewed key lab officials and contractors; and reviewed relevant policies and guidance. Congress has provided the Department of Defense's (DOD) research labs with several authorities to enhance management and operations. Four authorities that GAO examined provide lab directors with greater ability to make their own decisions regarding the funding of projects, hiring, lab management, and purchasing of equipment or services. 1. Laboratory initiated research authority. This authority, as implemented, provides labs with a means to fund new science and technology projects that they consider a priority. Labs may use a percentage of all funds available to the lab and are permitted to charge customers of the lab a percentage fee of the costs for activities performed by the lab for the customer. 2. Direct hire authority. This authority enables labs to compete with private industry for high-quality talent. For example, it provides for streamlined hiring of applicants with relevant advanced degrees, or students enrolled in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics programs. 3. Laboratory enhancement pilot program authority. This authority generally allows lab directors to propose alternative methods that might lead to more effective lab management, and waive certain policies or procedures that might affect implementation of these methods. 4. Micro-purchase authority. This authority raises the threshold for small purchases for DOD research lab activities from $3,500 to $10,000 to facilitate acquisitions. While labs have used these authorities, their use has sometimes been limited, particularly with the laboratory initiated research authority. DOD lab directors at Air Force, Navy, and Army cited several obstacles that impede wider use of that authority, specifically: Air Force: Financial management officials at the Air Force stated that the service's accounting system does not currently have an automated capability to transfer the allowable percentage fee of costs to a central account at the Air Force Research Laboratory. This lack of capability, officials noted, creates a significant administrative burden related to charging these fees. Navy: In fiscal year 2017, Navy labs invested $7.3 million in lab infrastructure projects, compared to $32.9 million and $53.7 million at the Air Force and Army, respectively. Navy lab officials told us that they were restricted in their use of infrastructure funds available under the laboratory initiated research authority due to a lack of clear guidance as to whether and how to use this authority within the Capital Investment Program of the Navy Working Capital Fund. Army: The Army requires its labs to use a similar percentage of funds from two sources: (1) what it refers to as directly appropriated funds and (2) funds labs charge for customer activities. Some Army lab directors reported assessing a lower rate on customer funds than allowed so as not to drive customers away. The labs then generally charge a lower than desired rate on their directly appropriated funds, which further constrains the total funding available to them. GAO is making three recommendations to enhance DOD's use of laboratory initiated research authority, including that the Air Force assess potential accounting system improvements, the Navy clarify how labs can use the authority for infrastructure improvements, and the Army assess its policy to determine whether changes are needed to remove disincentives for labs to use the authority. DOD concurred with the recommendations."], "length": 14000}

The passage also mentions that the VAIP process assumes all future growth in services will be provided directly through VA facilities, which is inaccurate given that VA purchases care from non-VA providers. Additionally, the passage outlines key elements from the DOD BRAC process that could be adapted for VA, including establishing goals, criteria, estimating costs and savings, organizing an appropriate structure, developing a common analytical framework, ensuring accountability through oversight mechanisms, and involving the audit community. The passage concludes by noting that some BRAC recommendations required sustained senior leadership attention and coordination among stakeholders, and that the large number and interdependence of actions presented challenges during implementation. Key evidence includes statistics on the number of vacant or mostly vacant buildings and the number of historic buildings held by VA, as well as the estimated cost of the VAIP process. Unique points include the suggestion that VA should address the limitations of its planning processes and the emphasis on the importance of stakeholder engagement and coordination in implementing BRAC-like processes. The passage also highlights the complexity of interdependent recommendations and the need for regular updates on implementation challenges and progress. The VA's facility inventory includes 430 vacant or mostly vacant buildings that are, on average, more than 60 years old, and an additional 784 buildings that are underutilized. The VA holds 2,957 historic buildings, which adds to the complexity of converting or disposing of them. The VAIP process is estimated to cost $108 million when fully complete, but its facility master plans assume all future growth in services will be provided directly through VA facilities, which is not accurate given that VA can provide care through its medical facilities or purchase health care services from non-VA providers. The passage suggests that VA should address the limitations of its planning processes and engage stakeholders effectively to align its facilities with the needs of veterans. The DOD BRAC process, which has been successful in transforming military infrastructure, could serve as a model for VA to adapt its own processes for aligning facilities and services. The passage emphasizes the importance of sustained senior leadership and coordination among stakeholders in implementing BRAC-like processes", "answers": ["VA operates one of the largest health care systems in the United States, utilizing more than 6,000 federally owned and 1,500 leased buildings. DOD has repeatedly applied the BRAC process to reduce the amount of unneeded property that it owns and leases and to save billions of dollars that could be applied to higher priority defense needs. This statement is based on GAO's April 2017 report related to VA facility alignment ( GAO-17-349 ) and numerous GAO reports related to the BRAC process as summarized in a June 2011 testimony ( GAO-11-704T ) and a March 2012 testimony ( GAO-12-513T ). This statement addresses (1) the factors that affect VA's facility alignment and the extent to which VA's capital-planning process facilitates the alignment of facilities with the veterans' population, and (2) the key elements and challenges affecting DOD and the Commission in BRAC 2005. Detailed information on our scope and methodologies for this work can be found in these published products, cited throughout this testimony. Geographic shifts in the veterans' population, changes in health care delivery, aging infrastructure, and limited stakeholder involvement affect the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) efforts to align its services and real property portfolio to meet the needs of veterans. For example, a shift over time from inpatient to outpatient care will likely result in underutilized space once used for inpatient care. Further, the historic status of some VA facilities adds to the complexity of converting or disposing of them. In such instances, it is often difficult and costly for VA to modernize, renovate, and retrofit these older facilities. GAO reported that two of the planning processes VA uses to align its facilities—VA's Strategic Capital Investment Planning (SCIP) and the VA Integrated Planning (VAIP)—have limitations that undermine VA's efforts to achieve its goals. Specifically: VA relies on the SCIP process to plan and prioritize capital projects, but VA routinely asks its facility planners to submit their next year's planned project narratives before knowing if their previous submissions have been funded. The overlapping budget cycle, which is outside of VA's control, combined with other SCIP limitations—including subjective narratives, long time frames, and restricted access to information—make it difficult for VA to rely on SCIP to accurately identify the capital necessary to address its service and infrastructure gaps. VA concurred that it needs to address SCIP limitations that are within its control, as GAO recommended; VA has made some progress in implementing the recommendation has made some progress in implementing the recommendation.\\ The VAIP process is estimated to cost $108 million and to produce market-level service delivery plans and facility master plans. However, the VAIP master plans incorrectly assume that all future growth in services will be provided directly through VA facilities without considering alternatives, such as purchasing care from the community. GAO recommended that VA consider discontinuing the VAIP facility master plans pending an assessment of their value as a facility-planning tool. VA agreed with the recommendation and is implementing it while pursuing a national realignment strategy.. Key elements of the Department of Defense's (DOD) 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process could benefit VA's asset and infrastructure review. The key elements included: (1) establishing goals for the process, (2) developing criteria for evaluating closures and realignments, and (3) establishing an organizational structure to develop closure and realignment options. GAO identified key challenges that affected DOD's implementation of BRAC 2005 and the results achieved; these challenges would need to be addressed if VA is to successfully apply the process. These challenges included: (1) large, complex recommendations required sustained senior leadership's attention and a high level of coordination among many stakeholders, and (2) the large number of actions that depend on each other for successful implementation. In the April 2017 report, GAO made recommendations related to capital planning and stakeholder involvement.

{"pred": " \n\nThe testimony discusses the challenges faced by the U.S. Navy in rebuilding its readiness, particularly after significant mishaps in 2017 that resulted in the loss of 17 sailors' lives and serious damage to Navy ships. The Navy has identified 111 recommendations to improve surface fleet readiness, with 78 (70%) implemented as of November 2018. However, the Navy continues to struggle with maintenance challenges, delayed ship maintenance, and insufficient crew manning. The testimony highlights that the Navy's readiness recovery is hampered by enduring maintenance and manning challenges, and that these issues will likely be exacerbated as the Navy seeks to expand its fleet by 25%. The testimony also notes that the Marine Corps has made progress in improving ground force readiness but faces challenges in aviation unit readiness. The Department of Defense (DOD) has developed a Readiness Recovery Framework to guide the services' efforts and plans to regularly assess, validate, and monitor readiness recovery. The testimony concludes with 25 specific recommendations to the Navy and the Marine Corps and an additional 20 recommendations to various other DOD components to assist these services in rebuilding the readiness of their forces and in modernizing for the future. Key evidence includes data showing that 30% of Navy maintenance was completed on time from 2012-2018, leading to over 27,000 days of ship delays. The testimony also cites workforce challenges at naval shipyards, including hiring and training personnel, and the need to improve management of shipyard investments. The testimony emphasizes the importance of addressing these challenges to ensure the Navy's ability to rebuild readiness and prepare for future threats. Unique points include the Navy's efforts to ensure surface ship crews are certified before deployment and the Marine Corps' plans to maximize amphibious training opportunities. The testimony also highlights the significant cost implications of maintenance delays, estimating that the Navy has spent $1.5 billion in fiscal year 2018 constant dollars to support attack submarines that are delayed in completing maintenance at the shipyards. The testimony concludes by noting that the Navy's readiness recovery is a complex and ongoing process that requires sustained management attention and the implementation of the recommended actions. The testimony also notes that the F-35 program faces sustainment challenges, including reliability and maintainability issues, and that the Department of Defense (DOD) needs to address these challenges to meet its aircraft availability goals and effectively deploy to support operations.

The Navy and Marine Corps are working to rebuild the readiness of their forces while growing and modernizing their aging fleet of ships and aircraft. However, achieving readiness recovery goals will take years as both services continue to be challenged to rebuild readiness amid continued operational demands. This statement provides information on current and future readiness challenges facing (1) the Navy ship and submarine fleet and (2) Navy and Marine Corps aviation. GAO also discusses prior recommendations on Navy and Marine Corps readiness and progress to address them. This statement is based on previously published work since 2015 related to Navy and Marine Corps readiness challenges, including shipyard workforce and capital investment, ship crewing, weapon system sustainment, the fighter pilot workforce, and modernizing force structure. GAO conducted site visits to the Pacific fleet in November 2018 and analyzed updated data, as appropriate. The Navy has taken steps to address training shortfalls in the surface fleet, but faces persistent maintenance and personnel challenges as it seeks to rebuild ship and submarine readiness. While the Navy has corrective actions underway, they will take years to implement. Following ship collisions in 2017, the Navy has taken steps to ensure its crews are trained to standards prior to deployment and made significant progress in those efforts. However, the Navy has struggled to complete ship maintenance—with only 30 percent of maintenance completed on time since fiscal year 2012—leading to thousands of days that ships were unavailable for training and operations (see figure). Additionally, manning shortfalls and experience gaps continue to contribute to high sailor workload and are likely to continue through at least fiscal year 2021. The Navy has developed a plan to improve shipyards and is re-examining its ship manning, among other actions; however, these positive steps have not yet fully addressed GAO's recommendations. Looking to the future, the Navy has indicated that it wants to grow its fleet to meet demands. However, the costs of such growth are not yet known and would likely require resourcing well above currently planned levels. Navy and Marine Corps aircraft availability has been limited due to numerous challenges (see figure). Specifically, the seven aircraft GAO reviewed have generally experienced decreasing availability since fiscal year 2011 and did not meet availability goals in fiscal years 2017 and 2018. The F-35—the future of naval aviation—also has not met availability goals due to part shortages and poor sustainment planning. In September 2018, the Department of Defense established aggressive targets for aircraft availability. While the Navy and Marine Corps are taking actions to improve aircraft availability, including addressing GAO's recommendations, aviation readiness will take many years to recover. GAO has made a total of 45 recommendations in the prior work described in this statement. The Department of Defense concurred with most of them, and has many actions underway, but has not yet fully implemented any.

{"pred": " \n\nPassage 1 discusses the federal government's use of fees, fines, and penalties as sources of revenue, highlighting the complexity of tracking and reporting these collections. The government receives significant sums from these sources, with over $350 billion collected in fiscal year 2017. Fees are charges for services or goods provided by the government, while fines and penalties are imposed for violations. The passage notes that these collections can be categorized into three types: offsetting collections, offsetting receipts, and governmental receipts, each with varying degrees of congressional oversight. The Digital Accountability and Transparency Act (DATA Act) and the Government Performance and Results Modernization Act (GPRAMA) aim to improve transparency and oversight by requiring more detailed reporting of federal spending and program information. However, the current reporting mechanisms do not provide a comprehensive, government-wide total of fees, fines, and penalties, nor do they offer the level of detail needed for effective oversight. The passage concludes by recommending that OMB make more disaggregated data on fees, fines, and penalties publicly available, including by agency, to enhance transparency and support congressional oversight. Key evidence includes the lack of a single, government-wide total for fees, fines, and penalties, and the absence of clear data on the extent to which these collections are used for specific programs. Unique points include the potential for inaccuracies in the government-wide totals of fees due to the designation criteria used by OMB and the need for regular reviews of these designations to ensure accuracy. The passage also highlights the challenges in defining and reporting fee, fine, and penalty data across agencies, emphasizing the importance of standardization and consistency. The DATA Act and GPRAMA are presented as potential models for improving transparency and data reporting, but the passage notes that implementing these changes would require significant resources and time. The overall argument is that while current efforts are insufficient, there is a strong case for improving the reporting and transparency of fees, fines, and penalties to better inform congressional oversight and decision-making. The main conclusion is that more detailed, accessible, and consistent data on these collections are needed to support effective oversight and improve government accountability. The key evidence includes the current limitations in reporting and the potential benefits of improved transparency. The unique points include the challenges in defining and reporting these data elements and the need for regular reviews of the fee designation criteria. The passage also emphasizes the importance of linking fee, fine, and penalty data with other government-wide data reporting efforts to enhance transparency and facilitate oversight. The recommendations focus on making more disaggregated data publicly", "answers": ["Congress has authorized federal agencies to collect hundreds of billions of dollars annually in fees, fines, and penalties. These collections can fund a variety of programs, including programs related to national security, and the protection of natural resources. Data on collections are important for congressional oversight and to provide transparency in agencies' use of federal resources. GAO was asked to review the availability of government-wide data on fees, fines, and penalties. This report examines (1) the extent to which data on collections of fees, fines, and penalties are publically available and useful for the purpose of congressional oversight; and (2) the benefits and challenges to government-wide reporting of fees, fines, and penalties. GAO assessed government-wide fee, fine, and penalty data against criteria for availability and usefulness based on multiple sources, including prior GAO work and input from staff of selected congressional committees. GAO interviewed OMB staff, Treasury officials, and representatives of organizations with expertise in federal budget issues and reviewed prior GAO work to identify benefits and challenges of reporting these data. There are no comprehensive, government-wide data at the level of detail that identifies specific fees, fines, or penalties. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) report data that include these collections at the budget account level, which generally covers a set of agency activities or programs. OMB and Treasury also report some summary data for budgeting and financial management purposes. In the Budget of the U.S. Government , for example, OMB data showed government-wide fees totaled just over $335 billion in fiscal year 2017. These reports, however, are not designed to inventory or analyze fee, fine, or penalty collections and have significant limitations for that purpose. Although OMB collects more disaggregated data on fees, fines, and penalties, it does not make the data publicly available. OMB uses the disaggregated data in its OMB MAX database—such as the agency and account—to compile reported totals, such as the government-wide fees total in the Budget of the U.S. Government . Until OMB makes more disaggregated data publicly available, Congress has limited information on collections by agency to inform oversight and decision-making. OMB's government-wide total of fees includes collections that are not fees and excludes some fee collections. The total includes all collections for accounts in which fees make up at least half of the account's collections and excludes all others. OMB does not direct agencies to regularly review and update the accounts included in the total. Therefore, if accounts' makeups change such that fee collections drop below, or rise above, the 50 percent threshold, accounts may have incorrect fee designations and the total may be inaccurate. Further, OMB does not disclose the limitation that the total may exclude some fees and include other collections that are not fees. As a result, some users of the data are likely unaware of the potential for the total fees to be overestimated or underestimated. Further, no source of government-wide data consistently reports data elements on fees, fines, and penalties that could help inform congressional oversight. Generally, congressional staff told us that additional data, such as amounts of specific penalties, would increase transparency and facilitate oversight. These data could help Congress identify trends in collections and significant changes that could be an indication of an agency's performance. While reporting government-wide fee, fine, and penalty data provides benefits, there are trade-offs in terms of the time and federal resources it would take to develop and implement a process for agencies to report these data. The level of federal investment would vary depending on factors, such as the number of data elements included and the level of detail reported. Developing a comprehensive and accessible data source would provide greater benefits, but would likely be resource intensive. Alternatively, incorporating a small number of data elements that Congress identifies as most useful for oversight into ongoing government-wide reporting efforts could incrementally improve transparency and information for oversight and decision-making, with fewer resources. GAO is making four recommendations to enhance OMB reporting on fees, fines, and penalties, including making disaggregated data publically available, updating instructions to federal agencies to review accounts designated as containing fees, and disclosing limitations in data reported.

{"pred": " \n\nPassage 1 discusses the competitive products of the United States Postal Service (USPS) and the challenges in ensuring accurate scanning of these products. USPS has seen significant growth in its competitive products, with revenue increasing from 10% to 28% of total mail revenues between fiscal years 2008 and 2017. The growth is attributed to the rise of e-commerce. Despite this growth, USPS faces increased competition from other delivery providers, particularly in the first- and last-mile delivery services. USPS employs a complex system of scanning to track the movement of competitive products, involving multiple scans at various stages of the delivery process. However, the system is not without flaws, as instances of missed or inaccurate scans still occur. USPS has not adopted a formal set of internal control standards for its operational activities, which may contribute to inconsistencies in scanning procedures and practices. The report recommends that USPS identify and adopt a set of internal control standards, improve the communication of standard operating procedures, and create standard operating procedures for managers to address inaccurate scans and use available reports effectively. USPS has agreed to conduct a cost study to determine the feasibility of adopting such standards. The passage highlights the importance of accurate scanning for USPS's competitiveness and the need for standardized procedures and controls to mitigate scanning errors. Key evidence includes the high scanning rate of competitive products, the impact of missed or inaccurate scans on revenue collection, and the lack of detailed and up-to-date standard operating procedures. Unique points include the reliance on stand-up talks and meetings for training and communication, and the potential for new employees to contribute to scanning errors due to lack of training. The report also notes that while USPS has a high scanning rate, some missed and inaccurate scans still occur, affecting millions of competitive products. The adoption of internal control standards could enhance USPS's efforts to improve operational internal controls for scanning competitive products. The report emphasizes the need for consistent standard operating procedures and clear communication of responsibilities to ensure accurate scanning and timely resolution of scanning issues. The lack of such standards and procedures may lead to inefficiencies and errors in the scanning process. The report concludes by recommending that USPS take steps to address these issues to improve its competitive position in the market. The key evidence includes the instances of missed or inaccurate scans, the lack of detailed standard operating procedures, and the reliance on stand-up talks and meetings for training and communication. The unique points include the potential for new employees to contribute to scanning errors due to lack of training and the need for consistent procedures to ensure accurate scanning. The report also highlights", "answers": ["USPS's competitive products have become increasingly important, comprising about 28 percent of USPS's total revenue. USPS scans these packages at various points throughout the postal network. When scans are inaccurate or missing, questions are raised about the veracity of USPS's data on scanning performance and can lead to customer complaints. GAO was asked to review USPS's scanning policies and procedures. In this report, GAO (1) describes USPS's scanning performance and (2) examines how USPS ensures accurate scanning. GAO reviewed USPS's policies and procedures and assessed them against internal control standards; interviewed officials from USPS and five high-volume mailers; and conducted site visits to six post offices in two USPS districts that represented a range of volume, number of routes, and performance. Mail products over which the United States Postal Service (USPS) does not exercise market dominance, such as many of its packages, are called competitive products. These items are scanned throughout the mail delivery system to track their progress (see figure). USPS data show that these products are almost always scanned. For example, USPS data showed that for the first three quarters of fiscal year 2018; all but one of USPS's 67 districts met their scanning goals. Additionally, mailers that account for a high volume of USPS's competitive products told GAO that they believed USPS was generally scanning products correctly. However, a small percentage of missed or inaccurate scans occur. For example, a report from one USPS district showed that for one week, 0.73 percent of the products delivered were missing a scan and that for the fiscal year to date almost 155,000 competitive products were missing a delivery scan. USPS has designed and implemented procedures and activities to help ensure accurate scanning, but some limitations could contribute to scanning errors. For example, USPS has not based its operational procedures for scanning on any internal control standards. USPS officials said the procedures were based on USPS's unique responsibilities, management experience, and sound business practices, but the officials could not identify specific standards or a framework that they followed as the basis for the procedures. USPS officials said they did not believe any internal controls standards applied to these procedures. By not basing procedures on standards, USPS may miss opportunities to improve how it achieves its mission to scan and measure the performance of competitive products. Additionally, USPS's scanning procedure documents, such as for outlining specific delivery scanning steps, are not always consistent, and USPS relies on more informal methods, such as meetings with employees to communicate changes. Thus, employees may not have accurate procedures available to them. Finally, USPS lacks procedures to help managers identify and address incorrect scans, address customer complaints or otherwise address scanning irregularities. For example, USPS's guidance for managers is limited to a list of bullet-points that do not detail the steps managers should follow to resolve scanning irregularities. In addition, this list has not been updated since 2005. Without consistent or detailed procedures, USPS's employees and managers may not scan items accurately or find information needed to resolve scanning issues—a situation that could hinder USPS's ability to reduce inaccurate or missing scans for these important mail products. GAO recommends that USPS: (1) identify and adopt internal control standards for its operational activities such as for scanning of competitive products; (2) improve the communication of procedures for scanning competitive products; and, (3) create procedures for supervisors on how to address inaccurate scans and resolve scanning issues. USPS agreed to explore addressing the first recommendation and agreed with the other two recommendations."], "length": 14278}

{"pred": " \n\nThe passage discusses the history and evolution of emergency powers in the United States, primarily focusing on presidential emergency powers. It begins by defining an emergency as an unforeseen combination of circumstances that require immediate action. The passage traces the origins of emergency powers back to the Continental Congress and the Constitutional Convention, noting that these powers have evolved significantly over time, becoming increasingly rooted in statutory law rather than relying solely on constitutional authority. Key events, such as President Lincoln's actions during the Civil War, illustrate the tension between presidential discretion and congressional oversight. The passage highlights the National Emergencies Act of 1976, which aimed to regulate the declaration and use of national emergencies, requiring presidential accountability and congressional oversight. The act established a procedure for declaring national emergencies and provided mechanisms for terminating them. The passage concludes by noting that while the National Emergencies Act has been in place for decades, it has not been revisited by congressional overseers, suggesting a need for further reforms and improvements in the regulation of emergency powers. The unique aspect of the passage is its comprehensive overview of the development and regulation of emergency powers, emphasizing the shift towards statutory law and the importance of balancing executive discretion with legislative oversight. The key evidence includes historical examples, such as Lincoln's actions, and the legislative measures taken to regulate these powers, such as the National Emergencies Act. The passage also draws on the views of political theorists, like John Locke, to contextualize the exercise of emergency powers within a broader framework of governance. The innovative point is the emphasis on the evolving nature of emergency powers and the need for ongoing legislative scrutiny to ensure they are used appropriately. The passage also notes anomalies in the activation of emergency powers, such as the suspension of wage requirements for Hurricane Katrina without declaring a national emergency, highlighting the flexibility and sometimes unconventional use of these powers. The summary ends by noting that while the National Emergencies Act has been in place for decades, it has not been revisited by congressional overseers, indicating a potential gap in current regulatory frameworks. The passage underscores the dynamic nature of emergency powers and the ongoing challenge of balancing executive authority with democratic accountability. The summary focuses on the historical context, the evolution of emergency powers, the role of statutory law, and the need for continuous legislative oversight.

Such powers may be stated explicitly or implied by the Constitution, assumed by the Chief Executive to be permissible constitutionally, or inferred from or specified by statute. Through legislation, Congress has made a great many delegations of authority in this regard over the past 230 years. There are, however, limits and restraints upon the President in his exercise of emergency powers. With the exception of the habeas corpus clause, the Constitution makes no allowance for the suspension of any of its provisions during a national emergency. Disputes over the constitutionality or legality of the exercise of emergency powers are judicially reviewable.

House Report Number 3128 included a provision for GAO to assess the risks of DHS using IBC in connection with its modernization efforts. This report examines (1) the extent to which DHS and the TRIO components followed best practices in analyzing alternatives, and the key factors, metrics, and processes used in their choice of a modernized financial management system; (2) the extent to which DHS managed the risks of using IBC for its TRIO project consistent with risk management best practices; and (3) the key factors and challenges that have impacted the TRIO project and DHS's plans for completing remaining key priorities. GAO interviewed key officials, reviewed relevant documents, and determined whether DHS followed best practices identified by GAO as necessary characteristics of a reliable, high-quality AOA process and other risk management best practices. The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) TRIO project represents a key effort to address long-standing financial management system deficiencies. During 2012 and 2013, the TRIO components—U.S. Coast Guard (Coast Guard), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO)—each completed an alternatives analysis (AA) to determine a preferred alternative for modernizing its financial management system. GAO found that DNDO's AA substantially met the four characteristics—well-documented, comprehensive, unbiased, and credible—that GAO previously identified for a reliable, high-quality analysis of alternatives (AOA) process. However, Coast Guard's and TSA's AAs did not fully or substantially meet three of these characteristics, and DHS guidance for conducting AAs did not substantially incorporate certain best practices, such as identifying significant risks and mitigation strategies and performing an independent review to help validate the AOA process. Based on these analyses and other factors, the TRIO components determined that migrating to a federal shared service provider (SSP) represented the best alternative, and in 2014, DHS selected the Department of the Interior's Interior Business Center (IBC) as the federal SSP for the project. However, because Coast Guard's and TSA's AAs did not fully or substantially reflect all of the characteristics noted above, they are at increased risk that the alternative selected may not achieve mission needs. DHS also did not fully follow best practices for managing project risks related to its use of IBC on the TRIO project. Specifically, DHS followed three of seven risk management best practices, such as determining risk sources and categories and establishing a risk management strategy. However, it did not fully follow four best practices for defining risk parameters, identifying risks, developing risk mitigation plans, and implementing these plans largely because its guidance did not sufficiently address these best practices. For example, although DHS created joint teams with IBC and provided additional resources to IBC to help address risk mitigation concerns, it did not always develop sufficiently detailed risk mitigation plans that also included contingency plans for selected critical risks. As a result, although IBC's capacity and experience for migrating large agencies the size of Coast Guard and TSA was identified as a risk in July 2014, a contingency plan working group to address this concern was not established until January 2017. By not fully following risk management best practices, DHS is at increased risk that potential problems may not be identified or properly mitigated. DHS, IBC, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and other federal oversight agencies identified various challenges that have impacted the TRIO project and contributed to a 2-year delay in the implementation of Coast Guard's and TSA's modernized solutions. These challenges include the lack of sufficient resources, aggressive schedule, complex requirements, increased costs, and project management and communication concerns. To help address these challenges, DHS and IBC established review teams and have taken other steps to assess potential mitigating steps. In May 2017, DHS determined that migrating the solution from IBC to a DHS data center represented the best option and initiated discovery efforts to further assess this as its path forward for the TRIO project. GAO recommends that DHS more fully follow best practices for conducting an AOA process and managing risks.

The fund is authorized to receive $900 million annually, primarily from oil and gas leases on the Outer Continental Shelf, but actual appropriations vary widely. Since its inception, less than half of the accrued funds have been appropriated, leaving an unappropriated balance of approximately $22 billion. The fund traditionally supports federal land acquisition and state outdoor recreation grants, but has also been used for other purposes, such as maintenance of federal land management agencies and ecosystem restoration. From FY1998 to FY2019, $2.7 billion was appropriated for other purposes, with the Forest Legacy Program and Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund receiving the largest shares. The LWCF's flexibility allows presidents to seek funding for diverse natural resource-related programs, but Congress ultimately decides which requests to fund. The fund's balance and the variation in annual appropriations highlight the need for consistent funding to achieve its dual goals of outdoor recreation and conservation. The LWCF has been used for a variety of natural resource-related programs, including facility maintenance, ecosystem restoration, and endangered species conservation, but in recent years, funding has been primarily directed towards the Forest Legacy Program and Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund. The unappropriated balance of $22 billion underscores the potential for greater investment in conservation and outdoor recreation, but also highlights the challenges of securing consistent funding for the LWCF. The fund's flexibility allows for diverse uses, but Congress's discretion in allocating funds means that the LWCF's impact on conservation and recreation can vary significantly from year to year. The LWCF's history demonstrates the importance of stable funding to achieve its dual goals of enhancing outdoor recreation and conserving natural resources. The fund's balance and the variation in annual appropriations underscore the need for consistent funding to ensure its effectiveness in achieving these goals. The LWCF's ability to fund a range of natural resource-related programs, from land acquisition to endangered species conservation, highlights its potential to make significant contributions to conservation and recreation. However, the lack of consistent funding and the variability in annual appropriations suggest that the fund's impact can be inconsistent and limited.

The fund also receives mandatory appropriations under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (GOMESA). The level of annual appropriations for the LWCF has varied since the origin of the fund in FY1965. The LWCF Act outlines uses of the fund for federal and state purposes. Of the total made available through appropriations or deposits under GOMESA, not less than 40% is to be used for \"federal purposes\" and not less than 40% is to be used to provide \"financial assistance to states.\" The act lists the federal purposes for which the President is to allot LWCF funds \"unless otherwise allotted in the appropriation Act making them available.\" These purposes primarily relate to acquisition of lands and waters (and interests therein) by the federal government. With regard to state purposes, the act authorizes a matching grant program to states for outdoor recreation purposes. Throughout the LWCF's history, appropriations acts typically have provided funds for land acquisition and outdoor recreational grants to states. Beginning in FY1998, appropriations also have been provided each year (except FY1999) to fund other purposes related to natural resources. The extent to which the LWCF should be used for purposes other than federal land acquisition and outdoor recreation grants to states, and which other purposes should be funded from the LWCF, continue to be the subject of legislation and debate in Congress. In the past few decades, Presidents have sought LWCF funds for a variety of other purposes. Congress chooses which if any of these requests to fund, and has chosen programs not sought by the President for a particular year. Among other programs, appropriations have been provided for facility maintenance of the land management agencies, ecosystem restoration, the Historic Preservation Fund, the Payments in Lieu of Taxes program, the Forest Legacy Program, State and Tribal Wildlife Grants (under the Fish and Wildlife Service), the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund, U.S. Geological Survey science and cooperative programs, and Bureau of Indian Affairs Indian Land and Water Claim Settlements. Since FY1998, a total of $2.7 billion has been appropriated for other purposes, of a total LWCF appropriation of $18.9 billion over the history of the fund. The Fish and Wildlife Service and the Forest Service have received the largest shares of the total appropriations for other purposes, about $1.4 billion (53%) and $1.0.billion (38%), respectively, from FY1998 to FY2019. Several agencies shared the remaining $0.2 billion (9%) of the appropriations. Both the dollar amounts and the percentages of annual LWCF appropriations for other purposes have varied widely since FY1998. The dollar amounts have ranged from $0 in FY1999 to $456.0 million in FY2001. The percentage of annual funds provided for other purposes ranged from 0% in FY1999 to a high of 59% in both FY2006 and FY2007. In some years, the appropriation for other purposes was significantly less than the Administration requested. For instance, for FY2008, the George W.

In February 2017, GAO found that both contractors had made progress, but their schedules were under mounting pressure. The contractors were originally required to provide NASA all the evidence it needed to certify that their systems met its requirements by 2017. A House report accompanying H.R. 5393 included a provision for GAO to review the progress of NASA's human exploration programs. This report examines the Commercial Crew Program, including (1) the extent to which the contractors have made progress towards certification and (2) how NASA's certification process addresses safety of the contractors' crew transportation systems. GAO analyzed contracts, schedules, and other documentation and spoke with officials from NASA, the Commercial Crew Program, Boeing, SpaceX, and two of NASA's independent review bodies that provide oversight. Both of the Commercial Crew Program's contractors, Boeing and Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX), are making progress finalizing designs and building hardware for their crew transportation systems, but both contractors continue to delay their certification milestone (see figure). Certification is the process that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will use to ensure that each contractor's system meets its requirements for human spaceflight for the Commercial Crew Program. Further delays are likely as the Commercial Crew Program's schedule risk analysis shows that the certification milestone is likely to slip. The analysis identifies a range for each contractor, with an earliest and latest possible completion date, as well as an average. The average certification date was December 2019 for Boeing and January 2020 for SpaceX, according to the program's April 2018 analysis. Since the Space Shuttle was retired in 2011, the United States has been relying on Russia to carry astronauts to and from the International Space Station (ISS). Additional delays could result in a gap in U.S. access to the space station as NASA has contracted for seats on the Russian Soyuz spacecraft only through November 2019. NASA is considering potential options, but it does not have a contingency plan for ensuring uninterrupted U.S. access. NASA's certification process addresses the safety of the contractors' crew transportation systems through several mechanisms, but there are factors that complicate the process. One of these factors is the loss of crew metric that was put in place to capture the probability of death or permanent disability to an astronaut. NASA has not identified a consistent approach for how to assess loss of crew. As a result, officials across NASA have multiple ways of assessing the metric that may yield different results. Consequently, the risk tolerance level that NASA is accepting with loss of crew varies based upon which entity is presenting the results of its assessment. Federal internal controls state that management should define risk tolerances so they are clear and measurable. Without a consistent approach for assessing the metric, the agency as a whole may not clearly capture or document its risk tolerance with respect to loss of crew. GAO is making five recommendations, including that NASA develop a contingency plan for ensuring a U.S. presence on the ISS and clarify how it will determine its risk tolerance for loss of crew. NASA concurred with three recommendations; partially concurred on the recommendation related to loss of crew; and non-concurred with a recommendation to report its schedule analysis to Congress.

This report assesses (1) the considerations NASA took into account when updating the project's cost and schedule commitments and (2) the extent to which NASA has taken steps to improve oversight and performance of JWST, among other issues. GAO reviewed relevant NASA policies, analyzed NASA and contractor data, and interviewed NASA and contractor officials. In June 2018, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) revised the cost and schedule commitments for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to reflect known technical challenges, as well as provide additional time to address unanticipated challenges. For example, the revised launch readiness date of March 2021 included 5.5 months to address a design issue for the cover of the sunshield (see image). The purpose of the sunshield is to protect the telescope's mirrors and instruments from the sun's heat. NASA found that hardware on the cover came loose during testing in April 2018. The new cost estimate of $9.7 billion is driven by the schedule extension, which requires keeping the contractor's workforce on board longer than expected. Before the project enters its final phase of integration and test, it must conduct a review to determine if it can launch within its cost and schedule commitments. As part of this review, the project is not required to update its joint cost and schedule confidence level analysis—an analysis that provides the probability the project can meet its cost and schedule commitments—but government and industry cost and schedule experts have found it is a best practice to do so. Such analysis would provide NASA officials with better information to support decisions on allocating resources, especially in light of the project's recent cost and schedule growth. NASA has taken steps to improve oversight and performance of JWST, and identified the JWST project manager as responsible for monitoring the continued implementation of these changes.

As part of its ongoing work on SNAP E&T programs, GAO analyzed E&T expenditures and participation data from fiscal years 2007 through 2016, the most recent data available; reviewed relevant research from USDA; and interviewed USDA and selected state and local officials. The prior work discussed in this testimony is based on four GAO products on E&T programs (GAO-03-388), improper payments (GAO-16-708T), recipient fraud (GAO-14-641), and retailer trafficking (GAO-07-53). Information on the scope and methodology of our prior work is available in each product. Overseen by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and administered by states, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Employment and Training (E&T) programs served about 0.5 percent of the approximately 43.5 million SNAP recipients in an average month of fiscal year 2016, according to the most recent USDA data available. These programs are generally designed to help SNAP recipients increase their ability to obtain regular employment through services such as job search and training. Some recipients may be required to participate. According to USDA, about 14 percent of SNAP recipients were subject to work requirements in an average month of fiscal year 2016, while others, such as children and the elderly, were generally exempt from these requirements. States have flexibility in how they design their E&T programs. Over the last several years, states have 1) increasingly moved away from programs that mandate participation, 2) focused on serving able-bodied adults without dependents whose benefits are generally time-limited unless they comply with work requirements, and 3) partnered with state and local organizations to deliver services. USDA has taken steps to increase support and oversight of SNAP E&T since 2014, including collecting new data on participant outcomes from states. GAO has ongoing work reviewing SNAP E&T programs, including USDA oversight. USDA and the states partner to address issues that affect program integrity, including improper payments and fraud, and USDA has taken some steps to address challenges in these areas, but issues remain. Improper Payments. In 2016, GAO reviewed SNAP improper payment rates and found that states' adoption of program flexibilities and changes in federal SNAP policy in the previous decade, as well as improper payment rate calculation methods, likely affected these rates. Although USDA reported improper payment estimates for SNAP in previous years, USDA did not report an estimate for benefits paid in fiscal years 2015 or 2016 due to data quality issues in some states. USDA has since been working with the states to improve improper payment estimates for the fiscal year 2017 review. Recipient Fraud. In 2014, GAO made recommendations to USDA to address challenges states faced in combatting recipient fraud. For example, GAO found that USDA's guidance on the use of transaction data to uncover potential trafficking lacked specificity and recommended USDA develop additional guidance. Since then, USDA has provided technical assistance to some states, including on the use of data analytics. GAO has ongoing work reviewing states' use of data analytics to identify SNAP recipient fraud. Retailer Trafficking. In 2006, GAO identified several ways in which SNAP was vulnerable to retailer trafficking—a practice involving the exchange of benefits for cash or non-food items. For example, USDA had not conducted analyses to identify high-risk retailers and target its resources. Since then, USDA has established risk levels for retailers based on various factors. GAO has ongoing work assessing how USDA prevents, detects, and responds to retailer trafficking and reviewing the usefulness of USDA's estimates of the extent of SNAP retailer trafficking. GAO is not making new recommendations. USDA generally concurred with GAO's prior recommendations."], "length": 12328}
{"pred": " \n\nThe Government Accountability Office (GAO) reviewed the clinical care reviews and reporting practices of five VA medical centers from October 2013 to March 2017. Key findings include:\n\n1. Documentation issues: Almost half of the 148 providers' clinical care reviews conducted by the VA medical centers lacked proper documentation, particularly for focused professional practice evaluations (FPPEs) for cause and retrospective reviews. Additionally, reviews were delayed for 16 providers for extended periods, sometimes multiple years, after concerns were raised about their care.\n\n2. Policy gaps: VHA policy does not mandate documentation for all types of reviews and does not specify timeliness requirements for initiating reviews. Consequently, VA medical centers often fail to document and timely conduct these reviews, leading to insufficient information for decision-making regarding providers' privileges.\n\n3. Reporting deficiencies: Only one of nine providers who faced adverse privileging actions or resigned during the review period was reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) and state licensing boards as required by VHA policy. Delays in reporting to these entities ranged from 100 to over 500 days, and some providers were not reported due to misunderstandings of VHA policies or lack of oversight.\n\n4. Recommendations: The GAO recommends that VHA require documentation of all reviews, establish timeliness requirements, and strengthen oversight by networks to ensure compliance with these requirements. VHA concurred with these recommendations and plans to implement changes.\n\nThe GAO's findings highlight significant gaps in the VA's oversight and reporting mechanisms, which can lead to substandard care and potential patient harm. The recommendations aim to improve accountability and ensure that providers with serious deficiencies are appropriately identified and restricted from practicing. The report underscores the importance of clear policies, robust documentation, and effective oversight in maintaining high standards of care within the VA system. The unique aspect of the report lies in its detailed examination of both documentation and reporting practices, revealing systemic issues that extend beyond individual cases. The findings also emphasize the critical role of timely and accurate reporting in preventing the continuation of substandard care by providers across different facilities. The report's comprehensive approach provides valuable insights into the challenges facing the VA in ensuring quality healthcare delivery.

The VA medical centers failed to conduct required focused professional practice evaluations (FPPEs) for cause for 26 providers and retrospective reviews for 8 providers. Reviews were also delayed for 16 providers. The VA lacks oversight mechanisms to ensure timely and thorough reviews of providers' clinical care. Additionally, the VA did not report nine providers to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) and state licensing boards as required, despite documenting significant clinical deficiencies. The VA also failed to report four contract providers who were terminated for clinical deficiencies. The VA's failure to report providers to the NPDB and state licensing boards allows substandard care providers to obtain privileges at other VA medical centers or hospitals outside the VA system. The GAO recommends that the VA require documentation of all reviews, establish timeliness requirements, and strengthen oversight to ensure providers are reported to the NPDB and state licensing boards. The VA concurred with these recommendations and plans to implement changes. The key evidence includes documentation gaps, delayed reviews, and instances of providers not being reported despite documented deficiencies. Unique points include the lack of oversight by the VA and the potential for substandard care providers to continue practicing elsewhere. The VA's failure to report providers to the NPDB and state licensing boards poses a risk to patient safety by allowing substandard care providers to continue practicing.

Since 1977, there have been 20 funding gaps, with the majority occurring between 1977 and 1995. Funding gaps can range from 1 to 34 days, and the most recent ones in FY1996, FY2014, FY2018, and FY2019 resulted in widespread shutdowns. The Civiletti opinions from 1980 clarified that the Antideficiency Act generally prohibits federal agencies from incurring obligations or expenditures without appropriations, except for activities involving the safety of human life or the protection of property. Funding gaps can occur at the start of the fiscal year or any time a CR expires without immediate enactment of a new CR or regular appropriations act. The enactment of automatic continuing resolutions (ACRs) has been proposed to prevent funding gaps, but none have been enacted permanently. Key evidence includes the historical frequency and duration of funding gaps, the impact on federal employees, and the guidance provided by the Civiletti opinions. Unique points include the distinction between funding gaps and shutdowns, and the potential for short-term CRs to mitigate the effects of funding gaps. The passage highlights the importance of timely enactment of appropriations to avoid disruptions in government operations. Funding gaps have significant impacts on federal operations, leading to shutdowns and furloughs, especially in recent years. The Civiletti opinions clarify the limitations imposed by the Antideficiency Act, emphasizing the need for specific statutory authorization for certain activities during funding gaps. The passage also notes the challenges in preventing funding gaps, despite proposals for automatic continuing resolutions, and underscores the need for effective budgeting processes to ensure continuous government operations.

Exceptions are made under the act, including for activities involving \"the safety of human life or the protection of property.\" The interval during the fiscal year when appropriations for a particular project or activity are not enacted into law, either in the form of a regular appropriations act or a continuing resolution (CR), is referred to as a funding gap or funding lapse. Although funding gaps may occur at the start of the fiscal year, they may also occur any time a CR expires and another CR (or the regular appropriations bill) is not enacted immediately thereafter. Multiple funding gaps may occur within a fiscal year. When a funding gap occurs, federal agencies are generally required to begin a shutdown of the affected projects and activities, which includes the prompt furlough of non-excepted personnel. The general practice of the federal government after the shutdown has ended has been to retroactively pay furloughed employees for the time they missed, as well as employees who were required to come to work. Although a shutdown may be the result of a funding gap, the two events should be distinguished. This is because a funding gap may result in a total shutdown of all affected projects or activities in some instances but not others. For example, when funding gaps are of a short duration, agencies may not have enough time to complete a shutdown of affected projects and activities before funding is restored. In addition, the Office of Management and Budget has previously indicated that a shutdown of agency operations within the first day of the funding gap may be postponed if a resolution appears to be imminent. Since FY1977, 20 funding gaps occurred, ranging in duration from 1 day to 34 full days. These funding gaps are listed in Table 1. About half of these funding gaps were brief (i.e., three days or less in duration). Notably, many of the funding gaps do not appear to have resulted in a \"shutdown.\" Prior to the issuance of the opinions in 1980 and early 1981 by then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti, while agencies tended to curtail some operations in response to a funding gap, they often \"continued to operate during periods of expired funding.\" In addition, some of the funding gaps after the Civiletti opinions did not result in a completion of shutdown operations due to both the funding gap's short duration and an expectation that appropriations would soon be enacted. Some of the funding gaps during this period, however, did have a broader impact on affected government operations, even if only for a matter of hours. Two funding gaps occurred in FY1996, amounting to 5 days and 21 days. The chronology of regular and continuing appropriations enacted during FY1996 is illustrated in Figure 1. At the beginning of FY2014 (October 1, 2013), none of the regular appropriations bills had been enacted, so a government-wide funding gap occurred. It concluded on October 17, 2013, after lasting 16 full days. During FY2018, there was a funding gap when a CR covering all of the regular appropriations bills expired on January 19, 2018. It concluded on January 22, 2018, after lasting two full days. The most recent funding gap occurred during FY2019, when a CR covering federal agencies and activities funded in 7 of the 12 regular appropriations bills expired on December 21, 2018. It concluded on January 25, 2019, after lasting 34 full days.

{"pred": " \n\nPassage 1 discusses the relationship between radiation dose and health effects, particularly focusing on low-dose radiation. The passage highlights that higher radiation doses lead to quicker and more severe health impacts, such as acute radiation syndrome, characterized by symptoms ranging from nausea to death within days or weeks. For low-dose radiation, defined as below 100 mSv, the exact cancer risk is uncertain due to limited data, especially when extrapolating from acute exposure scenarios like the atomic bomb survivors in Japan. Despite this uncertainty, regulatory bodies like the National Academies and the International Commission on Radiological Protection advocate for the linear no-threshold model, which assumes a proportional increase in cancer risk with radiation exposure. This model influences federal regulations, setting stringent limits on radiation exposure for both the public and workers. The passage also notes that while there is a consensus on the need for caution, the scientific community acknowledges the challenges in accurately estimating cancer risks from very low doses. Additionally, the passage mentions that federal agencies have allocated funding for research on low-dose radiation health effects, though the amount has decreased over recent years. The report concludes by recommending that the Department of Energy (DOE) lead the development of a collaborative mechanism for interagency research to address shared priorities in low-dose radiation health effects, emphasizing the potential for reducing uncertainty in predicting cancer risks. Key evidence includes data from various studies and the decreasing trend in research funding.

The Department of Energy (DOE), Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Food and Drug Administration generally used the advice of scientific advisory bodies to develop and apply radiation protection requirements and guidance for workers and the public in the radiation exposure settings that GAO reviewed. These settings were: (1) the operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants; (2) the cleanup of sites with radiological contamination; (3) the use of medical equipment that produces radiation; and (4) accidental or terrorism-related exposure to radiation. Specifically, the agencies relied on the advice of three scientific advisory bodies that supported the use of a model that assumes the risk of cancer increases with every incremental radiation exposure. Accordingly, the agencies have set regulatory dose limits and issued guidance to confine exposure to levels that reduce the risk of cancer, while recognizing that scientific uncertainties occur in estimating cancer risks from low-dose radiation. For example, NRC requires nuclear power plants to consider measures for limiting workers' exposure below NRC's regulatory dose limit, such as by using robots for maintenance work in radiation areas. GAO identified seven federal agencies that funded research on low-dose radiation's health effects. In fiscal years 2012 to 2016, DOE, NRC, EPA, and four other federal agencies obligated about $210 million for such research . Although the agencies have collaborated on individual projects on radiation's health effects, they have not established a collaborative mechanism to set research priorities. GAO's previous work has shown that federal agencies can use such mechanisms to implement interagency collaboration to develop and coordinate sound science policies. In the past, DOE took a leading role in this area because DOE provided stable funding and advocated for greater coordination on research on low-dose radiation's health effects. However, since fiscal year 2012, DOE has phased out funding for one of its main research programs in this area. This has created a void in coordination efforts among federal agencies, and no other agency has stepped forward to fill this void. Because of DOE's prior experience as a leader in this area of research and its research responsibility under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, it could play an important role in helping federal agencies establish a coordinating mechanism for low-dose radiation research.

Key benefits include cost savings, faster on-orbit capability, increased deterrence and resilience, and continual technology upgrades. Challenges include logistical issues such as size, weight, and power constraints, aligning development and acquisition timelines, and concerns over control and cybersecurity. The DOD's Hosted Payload Office (HPO) facilitates these arrangements by providing tools and expertise. Despite these challenges, the HPO has helped DOD achieve significant cost savings and rapid deployment of payloads. However, DOD lacks comprehensive data on the costs and benefits of commercially hosted payloads, leading to resistance among acquisition officials. Recommendations call for DOD to require programs using hosted payloads to share cost and technical data with a central office to improve decision-making and mitigate logistical challenges. The passage highlights the potential of commercially hosted payloads for DOD but emphasizes the need for better data and knowledge sharing to fully realize their benefits. The HPO plays a crucial role in facilitating these arrangements, but DOD needs to centralize and consolidate knowledge to overcome resistance and make informed decisions. The passage concludes by noting that DOD's experience and data are still limited, and centralizing knowledge could help position DOD to make reasoned, evidence-based decisions on the use of hosted payloads. The HPO's efforts to develop tools and share lessons learned are important steps towards overcoming logistical challenges and realizing the potential benefits of commercially hosted payloads. The passage also notes that while DOD has seen cost savings and rapid deployment with commercially hosted payloads, the lack of comprehensive data and knowledge sharing remains a barrier to wider adoption.

The H", "answers": ["Each year, DOD spends billions of dollars to develop, produce, and field large, complex satellites. For such satellite systems, a single adversary attack or on-orbit failure can result in the loss of billions of dollars of investment and significant loss of vital capabilities. As DOD plans new space systems and addresses an increasingly contested space environment, it has the opportunity to consider different acquisition approaches. One such approach is to integrate a government sensor or payload onto a commercial host satellite. House Armed Services Committee report 115-200, accompanying a bill for the Fiscal Year 2018 National Defense Authorization Act, included a provision for GAO to review DOD's use of commercially hosted payloads. This report (1) determines the extent to which DOD uses commercially hosted payloads and (2) describes and assesses factors that affect their use. GAO reviewed DOD policies, documentation, and planning documents, and interviewed a wide range of DOD and civil government officials, and commercial stakeholders. GAO and others have found that using commercial satellites to host government sensors or communications packages—called payloads—may be one way DOD can achieve on-orbit capability faster and more affordably. Using hosted payloads may also help facilitate a proliferation of payloads on orbit, making it more difficult for an adversary to defeat a capability. Since 2009, DOD has used three commercially hosted payloads, with three more missions planned or underway through 2022 (see figure below). DOD estimates that it has achieved cost savings of several hundred million dollars from using commercially hosted payloads to date, and expects to realize additional savings and deliver faster capabilities on orbit from planned missions. Cost savings can result from sharing development, launch, and ground system costs with the commercial host company. Among the factors that affect DOD's use of hosted payloads are a perception among some DOD officials that matching government payloads to commercial satellites is too difficult; and limited, fragmented knowledge on how to mitigate various challenges GAO found that further opportunities to use hosted payloads may emerge as DOD plans new and follow-on space systems in the coming years. However, DOD's knowledge on using hosted payloads is fragmented, in part because programs are not required to share information. In 2011, the Air Force created a Hosted Payload Office to provide expertise and other tools to facilitate matching government payloads with commercial hosts. However, GAO found that DOD programs using hosted payloads are not required and generally do not provide cost and technical data, or lessons learned, to the Hosted Payload Office, or another central office for analysis. Requiring programs that use hosted payloads agency-wide to provide this information to a central location would better position DOD to make informed decisions when considering acquisition approaches for upcoming space system designs. GAO recommends that DOD require programs using commercially hosted payloads to contribute resulting data to a central location. In implementing this recommendation, DOD should assess whether the Air Force's Hosted Payload Office is the appropriate location to collect and analyze the data. DOD concurred with the recommendation."], "length": 14510}

Key points include the significant role of SMCRA in regulating coal mining activities, particularly regarding financial assurances for reclamation. The act mandates that mine operators secure financial assurances to cover the cost of reclamation, which can be in the form of surety bonds, collateral bonds, self-bonds, or alternative bonding systems like bond pools. The passage highlights the challenges faced by regulatory authorities, such as the difficulty in assessing the financial health of operators, especially those with complex corporate structures, and the risk associated with self-bonding due to recent bankruptcies of major coal companies. Additionally, the passage notes that unanticipated reclamation costs, such as those related to long-term water pollution, pose significant risks. The text also mentions the importance of periodic reviews and inspections to ensure compliance with SMCRA and the financial adequacy of reclamation plans. Despite these measures, the passage concludes that the current system faces challenges, particularly with self-bonding, and suggests that Congress should consider amending SMCRA to eliminate the use of self-bonding as a type of financial assurance for coal mine reclamation. The key evidence includes statistics on the amount of financial assurances held by regulatory authorities and examples of cases where financial assurances were insufficient to cover reclamation costs.

SMCRA requires coal mine operators to reclaim lands that were disturbed during mining and to submit a financial assurance in an amount sufficient to ensure that adequate funds will be available to complete reclamation if the operator does not do so. Recent coal company bankruptcies have drawn attention to whether financial assurances obtained by OSMRE and state agencies will be adequate to reclaim land once coal mining operations have ceased. GAO was asked to review management of financial assurances for coal mine reclamation. This report describes, among other things, the amounts and types of financial assurances held for coal mine reclamation in 2017 and the challenges that OSMRE and state agencies face in managing these financial assurances. GAO collected and analyzed data from OSMRE and 23 state agencies; reviewed federal laws, regulations, and directives; and interviewed OSMRE and state agency officials and representatives from organizations associated with the mining and financial assurance industries and environmental organizations. State agencies and the Department of the Interior's Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE) reported holding approximately $10.2 billion in surety bonds (guaranteed by a third party), collateral bonds (guaranteed by a tangible asset, such as a certificate of deposit), and self-bonds (guaranteed on the basis of a coal operator's own finances) as financial assurances for coal mine reclamation. OSMRE and state agencies face several challenges in managing financial assurances, according to the stakeholders GAO interviewed. Specifically, Obtaining additional financial assurances from operators for unanticipated reclamation costs, such as long-term treatment for water pollution, can be difficult. Determining the financial stability of surety companies has been challenging in certain instances. Self-bonding presents a risk to the government because it is difficult to (1) ascertain the financial health of an operator, (2) determine whether the operator qualifies for self-bonding, and (3) obtain a replacement for existing self-bonds when an operator no longer qualifies. In addition, some stakeholders said that the risk from self-bonding is greater now than when the practice was first authorized under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA). GAO's previous work examining environmental cleanup found that the financial risk to government and the amount of oversight needed for self-bonds are relatively high compared to other forms of financial assurances. GAO also previously reviewed federal financial assurance requirements for various energy and mineral extraction sectors and found that coal mining is the only one where self-bonding was allowed. However, because SMCRA explicitly allows states to decide whether to accept self-bonds, eliminating the risk that self-bonds pose to the federal government and states would require SMCRA be amended. GAO recommends that Congress consider amending SMCRA to eliminate self-bonding. Interior neither agreed nor disagreed with GAO's recommendation."], "length": 14275}

CMS is responsible for assuring that expenditures—reported quarterly by states—are consistent with Medicaid requirements and matched with the correct amount of federal funds. CMS's review of reported expenditures has become increasingly complex due to variation in states' Medicaid programs and an increasing number of different matching rates. GAO was asked to examine CMS's oversight of state-reported Medicaid expenditures. In this report, GAO examined how CMS assures that (1) expenditures are supported and consistent with requirements; and (2) the correct federal matching rates were applied to expenditures subject to a higher match. GAO also examined the financial impact of resolved errors. GAO reviewed documentation for the most recently completed quarterly reviews by 3 of CMS's 10 regional offices for six states that varied by Medicaid program expenditures and design. GAO also reviewed policies, procedures, and data on resolved errors; and interviewed CMS and state officials. GAO assessed CMS's oversight processes against federal standards for internal control. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), which oversees Medicaid, has various review processes in place to assure that expenditures reported by states are supported and consistent with Medicaid requirements. The agency also has processes to review that the correct federal matching rates were applied to expenditures receiving a higher than standard federal matching rate, which can include certain types of services and populations. These processes collectively have had a considerable federal financial benefit, with CMS resolving errors that reduced federal spending by over $5.1 billion in fiscal years 2014 through 2017. However, GAO identified weaknesses in how CMS targets its resources to address risks when reviewing whether expenditures are supported and consistent with requirements. CMS devotes similar levels of staff resources to review expenditures despite differing levels of risk across states. For example, the number of staff reviewing California's expenditures—which represent 15 percent of federal Medicaid spending—is similar to the number reviewing Arkansas' expenditures, which represents 1 percent of federal Medicaid spending. CMS cancelled in-depth financial management reviews in 17 out of 51 instances over the last 5 years. These reviews target expenditures considered by CMS to be at risk of not meeting program requirements. CMS told GAO that resource constraints contributed to both weaknesses. However, the agency has not completed a comprehensive assessment of risk to (1) determine whether oversight resources are adequate and (2) focus on the most significant areas of risk. Absent such an assessment, CMS is missing an opportunity to identify errors in reported expenditures that could result in substantial savings to the Medicaid program. GAO also found limitations in CMS's processes for reviewing expenditures that receive a higher federal matching rate. Internal guidance for examining variances in these expenditures was unclear, and not all reviewers in the three CMS regional offices GAO reviewed were investigating significant variances in quarter-to-quarter expenditures. Review procedures for expenditures for individuals newly eligible for Medicaid under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act were not tailored to different risk levels among states. For example, in its reviews of a sample of claims for this population, CMS reviewed claims for the same number of enrollees—30—in California as for Arkansas, even though California had 10 times the number of newly eligible enrollees as Arkansas. Without clear internal guidance and better targeting of risks in its review procedures for expenditures receiving higher matching rates, CMS may overpay states.

This report examines the extent to which (1) each Service provides family support and (2) the Services monitor and DOD evaluates assignment coordination and family support. GAO analyzed DOD and Service-specific EFMP guidance and documents; analyzed fiscal year 2016 EFMP data (the most recent available); visited seven military installations, selected for their large numbers of military-connected students; and interviewed officials responsible for implementing each Service's EFMP, as well as officials in OSN that administer DOD's EFM policy. The support provided to families with special needs through the Department of Defense's (DOD) Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP) varies widely for each branch of Military Service. Federal law requires DOD's Office of Special Needs (OSN) to develop a uniform policy that includes requirements for (1) developing and updating a services plan for each family with special needs and (2) resources, such as staffing, to ensure an appropriate number of family support providers. OSN has developed such a policy, but DOD relies on each Service to determine its compliance with the policy. However, Army and Navy officials said they have not received feedback from OSN about the extent to which their Service-specific guidance complies. Federal internal control standards call for developing clear policies to achieve agency goals. In addition, DOD's most recent annual reports to Congress do not indicate the extent to which each Service provides services plans or allocates sufficient resources for family support providers. According to GAO's analysis, the Military Services have developed relatively few services plans, and there is wide variation in the number of family support providers employed, which raises questions about potential gaps in services for families with special needs (see table). Each Service uses various mechanisms to monitor how servicemembers are assigned to installations (assignment coordination) and obtain family support, but DOD has not established common performance measures to assess these activities. DOD has taken steps to better support families with special needs, according to the DOD officials GAO interviewed. For example, DOD established a working group to identify gaps in services. However, OSN officials said that DOD lacks common performance measures for assignment coordination and family support because the Services have not reached consensus on what those measures should be. In addition, OSN does not have a process to systematically evaluate the results of the Services' monitoring activities. Federal internal control standards call for assessing performance over time and evaluating the results of monitoring activities. Without establishing common performance measures and assessing monitoring activities, DOD will be unable to fully determine the effect of its efforts to better support families with special needs and the adequacy of the Services' EFMPs as required by federal law.

House Report Number 3128 included a provision for GAO to assess the risks of DHS using IBC in connection with its modernization efforts. This report examines (1) the extent to which DHS and the TRIO components followed best practices in analyzing alternatives, and the key factors, metrics, and processes used in their choice of a modernized financial management system; (2) the extent to which DHS managed the risks of using IBC for its TRIO project consistent with risk management best practices; and (3) the key factors and challenges that have impacted the TRIO project and DHS's plans for completing remaining key priorities. GAO interviewed key officials, reviewed relevant documents, and determined whether DHS followed best practices identified by GAO as necessary characteristics of a reliable, high-quality AOA process and other risk management best practices. The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) TRIO project represents a key effort to address long-standing financial management system deficiencies. During 2012 and 2013, the TRIO components—U.S. Coast Guard (Coast Guard), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO)—each completed an alternatives analysis (AA) to determine a preferred alternative for modernizing its financial management system. GAO found that DNDO's AA substantially met the four characteristics—well-documented, comprehensive, unbiased, and credible—that GAO previously identified for a reliable, high-quality analysis of alternatives (AOA) process. However, Coast Guard's and TSA's AAs did not fully or substantially meet three of these characteristics, and DHS guidance for conducting AAs did not substantially incorporate certain best practices, such as identifying significant risks and mitigation strategies and performing an independent review to help validate the AOA process. Based on these analyses and other factors, the TRIO components determined that migrating to a federal shared service provider (SSP) represented the best alternative, and in 2014, DHS selected the Department of the Interior's Interior Business Center (IBC) as the federal SSP for the project. However, because Coast Guard's and TSA's AAs did not fully or substantially reflect all of the characteristics noted above, they are at increased risk that the alternative selected may not achieve mission needs. DHS also did not fully follow best practices for managing project risks related to its use of IBC on the TRIO project. Specifically, DHS followed three of seven risk management best practices, such as determining risk sources and categories and establishing a risk management strategy. However, it did not fully follow four best practices for defining risk parameters, identifying risks, developing risk mitigation plans, and implementing these plans largely because its guidance did not sufficiently address these best practices. For example, although DHS created joint teams with IBC and provided additional resources to IBC to help address risk mitigation concerns, it did not always develop sufficiently detailed risk mitigation plans that also included contingency plans for selected critical risks. As a result, although IBC's capacity and experience for migrating large agencies the size of Coast Guard and TSA was identified as a risk in July 2014, a contingency plan working group to address this concern was not established until January 2017. By not fully following risk management best practices, DHS is at increased risk that potential problems may not be identified or properly mitigated. DHS, IBC, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and other federal oversight agencies identified various challenges that have impacted the TRIO project and contributed to a 2-year delay in the implementation of Coast Guard's and TSA's modernized solutions. These challenges include the lack of sufficient resources, aggressive schedule, complex requirements, increased costs, and project management and communication concerns. To help address these challenges, DHS and IBC established review teams and have taken other steps to assess potential mitigating steps. In May 2017, DHS determined that migrating the solution from IBC to a DHS data center represented the best option and initiated discovery efforts to further assess this as its path forward for the TRIO project. GAO recommends that DHS more fully follow best practices for conducting an AOA process and managing risks.

{"pred": " \n\nThe GAO report in Passage 1 highlights significant deficiencies in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA)'s oversight and documentation of reviews of providers' clinical care. From October 2013 to March 2017, five VA medical centers conducted reviews for 148 providers but lacked documentation for almost half of these reviews. Specifically, the report found that 26 providers were not reviewed properly for cause, and 21 providers were never reviewed at all. Additionally, 8 providers were not reviewed retrospectively, and 12 providers had no documentation of any type of review. The report also noted that reviews were often delayed, with some taking up to multiple years to initiate. These issues stem from a lack of VHA policy requiring documentation of all reviews and inadequate oversight by VHA networks. The report recommends that VHA require documentation of all reviews, establish timeliness requirements, and strengthen oversight. The report further reveals that despite significant clinical deficiencies, only one of nine providers required to be reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) was actually reported, and none were reported to state licensing boards as required. This failure to report providers who provide substandard care allows them to continue practicing at other VA facilities or in the broader healthcare system, potentially harming patients. The report concludes that VHA's failure to report providers to the NPDB and state licensing boards undermines patient safety and violates federal policy. The GAO recommends that VHA require its networks to establish a process for overseeing VA medical centers to ensure timely reporting to the NPDB and state licensing boards. The report underscores the critical importance of robust oversight and documentation in ensuring patient safety and adherence to federal regulations. The key evidence includes the lack of documentation for 148 provider reviews, the failure to report providers to the NPDB and state licensing boards, and the resulting potential for substandard care providers to continue practicing. Unique points include the recommendation for VHA to strengthen its oversight and the emphasis on the importance of timely and thorough documentation in provider reviews. The report also highlights the broader implications of these deficiencies for patient safety and the integrity of the VA healthcare system. The summary focuses on the main findings, key evidence, and unique recommendations of the report, providing a concise overview of the critical issues and their significance.

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (VAMC) officials are responsible for reviewing the clinical care delivered by their privileged providers—physicians and dentists who are approved to independently perform specific services—after concerns are raised. The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care. For example, GAO found that after one VAMC failed to report to the NPDB or SLBs a provider who resigned to avoid an adverse privileging action, a non-VA hospital in the same city took an adverse privileging action against that same provider for the same reason 2 years later."], "length": 13937}

Three space telescope projects are the key enablers for NASA to achieve its astrophysics' science goals, which include seeking to understand the universe. In its fiscal year 2018 budget request, NASA asked for about $697 million for these three projects, which represents over 50 percent of NASA's budget for its astrophysics' major projects. In total, these projects represent an expected investment of at least $12.4 billion. This statement reflects preliminary observations on (1) the current status and cost of NASA's major telescope projects and (2) lessons learned that can be applied to NASA's management of its telescope projects. This statement is based on ongoing work on JWST and ongoing work on the status of NASA's major projects. Both reports are planned to be published in Spring 2018. This statement is also based on past GAO reports on JWST and NASA's acquisitions of major projects, and NASA input. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) current portfolio of major space telescopes includes three projects that vary in cost, complexity, and phase of the acquisition life cycle. GAO's ongoing work indicates that these projects are each making progress in line with their phase of the acquisition cycle but also face some challenges. For example, the current launch date for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) project reflects a 57-60-month delay from the project's original schedule. GAO's preliminary observations indicate this project still has significant integration and testing to complete, with very little schedule reserve remaining to account for delays. Therefore, additional delays beyond the delay of up to 8 months recently announced are likely, and funding available under the $8 billion Congressional cost cap for formulation and development may be inadequate. There are a number of lessons learned from its acquisitions that NASA could consider to increase the likelihood of successful outcomes for its telescope projects, as well as for its larger portfolio of projects, such as its human spaceflight projects. For example, twice in the history of the JWST program, independent reviews found that the program was not holding adequate cost and schedule reserves. GAO has found that NASA has not applied this lesson learned to all of its large projects, and similar outcomes to JWST have started to emerge. For example, NASA did not incorporate this lesson with its human spaceflight programs. In July 2016 and April 2017, GAO found that these programs were holding inadequate levels of cost and schedule reserves to cover unexpected cost increases or delays. In April 2017, GAO recommended that NASA reassess the date of the programs' first test flight. NASA concurred and, in November 2017, announced a launch delay of up to 19 months.

The SBA administers numerous programs to support small businesses, including the 8(a) program for disadvantaged businesses, HUBZone program for businesses in underutilized zones, and SDVOSB and WOSB programs for service-disabled veterans and women-owned businesses. The SBA also oversees the small business goaling program and subcontracting plans. While these programs have bipartisan support, critics argue they may not effectively promote small business opportunities or economic diversity.

One way in which Congress has exercised this authority is by adopting measures to promote contracting and subcontracting between \"small businesses\" and federal agencies. These measures, among other things, declare a congressional policy of ensuring that a \"fair proportion\" of federal contract and subcontract dollars is awarded to small businesses; establish government-wide and agency-specific goals for the percentage of federal contract and subcontract dollars awarded to small businesses; establish an annual Small Business Goaling Report to measure progress in meeting these goals; generally require federal agencies, under specified circumstances, to reserve contracts that have an anticipated value greater than the micro-purchase threshold (currently $10,000), but not greater than the simplified acquisition threshold (currently $250,000) exclusively for small businesses; authorize federal agencies, under specified circumstances, to set aside contracts that have an anticipated value greater than the simplified acquisition threshold exclusively for small businesses; authorize federal agencies to make sole source awards to small businesses when the award could not otherwise be made (e.g., only a single source is available, under urgent and compelling circumstances); authorize federal agencies to set aside contracts for, or grant other contracting preference to, specific types of small businesses (e.g., 8(a) small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, women-owned small businesses (WOSBs) and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSBs)); and task the Small Business Administration (SBA) and other federal procurement officers with reviewing and restructuring proposed procurements to maximize opportunities for small business participation. Small business contracting programs generally have strong bipartisan support. However, that does not mean that these programs face no opposition, or that issues have not been raised concerning the impact and operations of specific programs. For example, small business advocates note that implementing regulations in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) narrow the reach (and impact) of some small business contracting preferences by excluding specific types of contracts, such as those listed in the Federal Supply Schedules, from FAR requirements pertaining to small business contracting. Advocates want the federal government to enact policies that reduce or eliminate such exclusions. Critics have questioned some of these programs' effectiveness, in terms of both promoting small business opportunities to win federal contracts and promoting a more diversified, robust economy. Many observers judge the relative success or failure of federal efforts to enhance small business contracting opportunities by whether federal government and individual federal agencies meet the predetermined procurement goals in the annual Small Business Goaling Report. In recent years, the federal government has generally succeeded in meeting the government-wide goals of awarding 23% of the total value of all small business eligible prime contract awards to small businesses, 5% to small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs), and 3% to SDVOSBs. It has had difficulty meeting the goals of 5% to WOSBs and 3% to HUBZone small businesses. The Small Business Goaling Report is the most convenient measure available to compare federal small business contracting performance over time, but it has limitations. For example, the SBA excludes some contracts from the report in its determination of what is \"small business eligible\" and some federal procurement activities are not included because they are not recorded in the Federal Procurement Data System—Next Generation.

The act aimed to create a competitive environment for the U.S. commercial space launch industry while minimizing taxpayer costs. FAA evaluates the Maximum Liability Protection (MPL) for each launch or reentry license, considering the number of potential casualties, the cost of those casualties, and property damage. Since 2012, FAA has revised its MPL methodology, adopting the risk profile method and reducing the factor used to estimate property damage. However, FAA has not fully addressed the Commercial Space Launch Act's (CSLCA) mandates, including ensuring a balanced risk between launch companies and the federal government, analyzing the cost impact of the updated methodology, consulting with the commercial space sector and insurance providers, and establishing guidance on the most appropriate methods for each launch. Key weaknesses in the MPL methodology, such as the outdated cost of a casualty and the method of estimating property damage, remain unaddressed. Despite these revisions, FAA has not reevaluated the probability thresholds used to allocate risk, consulted with relevant stakeholders, or prioritized updating the cost of a casualty. Recommendations include reevaluating probability thresholds, analyzing cost impacts, consulting with stakeholders, and establishing guidance for the most appropriate methods to use for each launch. These actions are crucial for ensuring the validity of the MPL methodology and maintaining a balanced risk between launch companies and the federal government. The report concludes that FAA needs to prioritize these recommendations to effectively manage financial exposure and support the commercial space industry.

This arrangement requires space launch companies to have a specific amount of insurance to cover these damages. The government is potentially liable for damages above that amount, up to a cap GAO estimated to be $3.1 billion in 2017, subject to appropriations in advance. CSLCA, enacted in 2015, directed the Department of Transportation, of which FAA is a part, to evaluate its MPL methodology and, if necessary, develop a plan to update that methodology. The act also included a provision requiring GAO to assess FAA's evaluation and any actions needed to update the methodology. This report discusses the extent to which (1) FAA's evaluation report addresses the requirements in CSLCA and (2) FAA has addressed previously identified weaknesses in the MPL methodology. GAO reviewed documents and interviewed FAA on its loss methodology evaluation and actions to address weaknesses. The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) report evaluating its maximum probable loss (MPL) methodology did not fully address the evaluation and consultation requirements specified by the U.S. Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act (CSLCA). Balance of Risk. CSLCA required FAA to include ensuring that the federal government is not exposed to greater indemnification costs and that launch companies are not required to purchase more insurance coverage than necessary as a result of FAA's MPL methodology. FAA said that it ensured this balance by improving its methodology, but it did not reevaluate its probability thresholds after revising its methodology. These thresholds are used to divide the risk of loss between launch companies and the government. Impact on Costs. The act required FAA to consider the costs to both the industry and the federal government of implementing an updated methodology. FAA's report discussed the impact on indirect costs, such as data collection, but did not discuss direct costs: insurance premiums for launch companies and indemnification liability for the federal government. Consultation. The act also required FAA to consult with the commercial space sector and insurance providers in evaluating its MPL methodology in accordance with the preceding requirements. While the agency consulted with some stakeholders, these consultations were limited in scope. FAA officials said they have not been able to take the actions needed to fully satisfy the mandated elements because of issues such as resource limitations and the lack of available data. However, by not resolving these issues, FAA lacks assurance that launch companies are not purchasing more insurance than needed or that the federal government is not being exposed to greater indemnification costs than expected. FAA has addressed two of three previously identified weaknesses in its MPL methodology but has not yet dealt with the remaining weakness. Specifically, the agency has revised its methodology for estimating the number of potential casualties for a launch and changed the factor it uses to derive estimated property damage from estimated casualties. However, FAA has not updated the amount used for the cost of an individual casualty. GAO recommended in a March 2017 report (GAO-17-366) that FAA update this amount. Not doing so could understate the amount of insurance launch companies are required to purchase, exposing the federal government to excess risk. GAO also determined that while FAA has two tools and methods it can use in making its MPL estimates, it does not have guidance on determining which are most appropriate for a given launch scenario. For example, one tool is more comprehensive but also labor intensive to use, while the other is inappropriate for certain launch scenarios and could result in misleading MPL amounts. Officials said they have begun to create such guidance but do not have an estimated completion date. Without such guidance, FAA cannot ensure that the most appropriate MPL methodology is used for each launch. FAA should fully address mandated requirements in evaluating its MPL—probability thresholds, direct costs, and stakeholder consultations— and establish an estimated completion date for developing guidance on tools and methods to use for specific launch scenarios.

{"pred": " \n\nThe Navy has experienced significant mishaps and challenges in recent years, including four major incidents resulting in 17 sailor fatalities and extensive ship damage. These mishaps are partly attributed to the Navy's increased deployment lengths and reduced training and maintenance periods to meet operational demands. The Navy has also seen a decrease in the number of ships while maintaining a roughly constant number of deployed ships, leading to higher operational tempo and stress on crews. Additionally, the Navy has assigned more ships to overseas homeports, which has resulted in higher operational costs and reduced training and maintenance opportunities. The Navy's efforts to improve readiness through the optimized fleet response plan have faced challenges, such as delayed maintenance and workforce inexperience.

Three of these incidents involved ships homeported in Japan. In response to these incidents, the Chief of Naval Operations ordered an operational pause for all fleets worldwide, and the Vice Chief of Naval Operations directed a comprehensive review of surface fleet operations, stating that these tragic incidents are not limited occurrences but part of a disturbing trend in mishaps involving U.S. ships. This statement provides information on the effects of homeporting ships overseas, reducing crew size on ships, and not completing maintenance on time on the readiness of the Navy and summarizes GAO recommendations to address the Navy's maintenance, training, and other challenges. In preparing this statement, GAO relied on work it has published since 2015 related to the readiness of ships homeported overseas, sailor training and workload issues, maintenance challenges, and other issues. GAO updated this information, as appropriate, based on Navy data. GAO's prior work shows that the Navy has increased deployment lengths, shortened training periods, and reduced or deferred maintenance to meet high operational demands, which has resulted in declining ship conditions and a worsening trend in overall readiness. The Navy has stated that high demand for presence has put pressure on a fleet that is stretched thin across the globe. Some of the concerns that GAO has highlighted include: Degraded readiness of ships homeported overseas: Since 2006, the Navy has doubled the number of ships based overseas. Overseas basing provides additional forward presence and rapid crisis response, but GAO found in May 2015 that there were no dedicated training periods built into the operational schedules of the cruisers and destroyers based in Japan. As a result, the crews of these ships did not have all of their needed training and certifications. Based on updated data, GAO found that, as of June 2017, 37 percent of the warfare certifications for cruiser and destroyer crews based in Japan—including certifications for seamanship—had expired. This represents more than a fivefold increase in the percentage of expired warfare certifications for these ships since GAO's May 2015 report. The Navy has made plans to revise operational schedules to provide dedicated training time for overseas-based ships, but this schedule has not yet been implemented. Crew size reductions contribute to sailor overwork and safety risks: GAO found in May 2017 that reductions to crew sizes the Navy made in the early 2000s were not analytically supported and may now be creating safety risks. The Navy has reversed some of those changes but continues to use a workweek standard that does not reflect the actual time sailors spend working and does not account for in-port workload—both of which have contributed to some sailors working over 100 hours a week. Inability to complete maintenance on time: Navy recovery from persistently low readiness levels is premised on adherence to maintenance schedules. However, in May 2016, GAO found that the Navy was having difficulty completing maintenance on time. Based on updated data, GAO found that, in fiscal years 2011 through 2016, maintenance overruns on 107 of 169 surface ships (63 percent) resulted in 6,603 lost operational days (i.e., the ships were not available for training and operations). Looking to the future, the Navy wants to grow its fleet by as much as 30 percent but continues to face challenges with manning, training, and maintaining its existing fleet. These readiness problems need to be addressed and will require the Navy to implement GAO's recommendations—particularly in the areas of assessing the risks associated with overseas basing, reassessing sailor workload and the factors used to size ship crews, managing investments to modernize and improve the efficiency of the naval shipyards, and applying sound planning and sustained management attention to its readiness rebuilding efforts. In addition, continued congressional oversight will be needed to ensure that the Navy demonstrates progress in addressing its maintenance, training, and other challenges. GAO made 14 recommendations in prior work cited in this statement. The Department of Defense generally concurred with all of them but has implemented only 1.

The act authorizes funding for three programs: Basic Center Program (BCP), Transitional Living Program (TLP), and Street Outreach Program (SOP). Key statistics show that over 36,000 youth were identified as homeless in the 2018 PIT count, and Voices of Youth Count estimated that approximately 700,000 youth aged 13 to 17 and 3.5 million young adults aged 18 to 25 experienced homelessness within a one-year period. The report highlights that family conflict is a major reason for youth homelessness, with LGBTQ youth being disproportionately affected. The Runaway and Homeless Youth Program has evolved over time, with the most recent emphasis on ending youth homelessness through coordinated efforts by federal agencies like the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness. Funding for the program has increased, with notable increases in FY2017 and FY2018. The BCP, TLP, and SOP provide essential services such as shelter, counseling, and outreach to help these youth transition to stable living situations. The report also notes challenges in accurately counting the number of homeless and runaway youth due to their mobility and reluctance to disclose their status. Innovative approaches, such as the Rural Host Homes Demonstration Project and the Transitional Living Program Special Population Demonstration project, aim to address the unique needs of rural and LGBTQ youth. Overall, the passage underscores the ongoing need for comprehensive support systems to assist runaway and homeless youth in achieving stability and independence.

The summary also", "answers": ["This report discusses runaway and homeless youth, and the federal response to support this population. There is no single definition of the terms \"runaway youth\" or \"homeless youth.\" However, both groups of youth share the risk of not having adequate shelter and other provisions, and may engage in harmful behaviors while away from a permanent home. Youth most often cite family conflict as the major reason for their homelessness or episodes of running away. A youth's sexual orientation, sexual activity, school problems, and substance abuse are associated with family discord. The precise number of homeless and runaway youth is unknown due to their residential mobility and overlap among the populations. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is supporting data collection efforts, known as Voices of Youth Count, to better determine the number of homeless youth. The 2017 study found that approximately 700,000 youth ages 13 to 17 and 3.5 million young adults ages 18 to 25 experienced homelessness within a 12-month period because they were sleeping in places not meant for habitation, in shelters, or with others while lacking alternative living arrangements. From the early 20th century through the 1960s, the needs of runaway and homeless youth were handled locally through the child welfare agency, juvenile justice courts, or both. The 1970s marked a shift toward federal oversight of programs that help youth who had run afoul of the law, including those who committed status offenses (i.e., a noncriminal act that is considered a violation of the law because of the youth's age). The Runaway Youth Act of 1974 was enacted as Title III of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (P.L. 93-415) to assist runaways through services specifically for this population. The act was amended over time to include homeless youth. It authorizes funding for services carried out under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Program (RHYP), which is administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The program was most recently authorized through FY2020 by the Juvenile Justice Reform Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-385). This law did not make other changes to the RHYP statute. Funding is discretionary, meaning provided through the appropriations process. FY2019 appropriations are $127.4 million. The RHYP program is made up of three components: the Basic Center Program (BCP), Transitional Living Program (TLP), and Street Outreach Program (SOP). The BCP provides temporary shelter, counseling, and after care services to runaway and homeless youth under age 18 and their families. In FY2017, the program served 23,288 youth, and in FY2018 it funded 280 BCP shelters (most recent figures available). The TLP is targeted to older youth ages 16 through 22 (and sometimes an older age). In FY2017, the TLP program served 3,517 youth, and in FY2018 it funded 299 grantees (most recent figures available). Youth who use the TLP receive longer-term housing with supportive services. The SOP provides education, treatment, counseling, and referrals for runaway, homeless, and street youth who have been subjected to, or are at risk of being subjected to, sexual abuse, sex exploitation, and trafficking. In FY2017, the SOP grantees made contact with 24,366 youth. The RHYP is a part of larger federal efforts to end youth homelessness through the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH). The USICH is a coordinating body made up of multiple federal agencies committed to addressing homelessness. The USICH's Opening Doors plan to end homelessness includes strategies for ending youth homelessness by 2020, including through collecting better data and supporting evidence-based practices to improve youth outcomes. Voices of Youth Count is continuing to report on characteristics of homeless youth. In addition to the RHYP, there are other federal supports to address youth homelessness. HUD's Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program is funding a range of housing options for youth, in selected urban and rural communities. Other federal programs have enabled homeless youth to access services, including those related to education and family violence."], "length": 13934}

Key areas for potential gains include better managing fragmentation in printing and reproduction services, reducing overlap in procuring print devices, meeting goals to reduce the number of print devices, and consolidating locations that provide mission specialty printing. The DOD has not adequately assessed the effectiveness of DLA Document Services' single manager role or the best approach to obtaining print devices. Additionally, the DOD's budget materials inaccurately represent the scope of its document services mission, lacking detail on print device procurement and electronic content management. Recommendations include assessing the single manager role, evaluating the cost-effectiveness of print device procurement, implementing controls to monitor print device reductions, assigning responsibility for implementing the memorandum on optimizing IT device usage, gathering data on workload revenue, and improving the accuracy of budgetary and financial information reporting. The DOD partially concurred with some recommendations and provided technical comments, but the core issues remain unresolved. The report highlights the need for more transparent and accurate financial reporting to support informed decision-making and efficiency improvements in document services. The DOD is taking steps towards efficiency but faces challenges in fully realizing potential savings and ensuring accountability in document services management. The report identifies specific areas for improvement and recommends actions to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of DOD's document services.

DLA Document Services has key DOD-wide responsibilities for (1) printing and reproduction, (2) print device procurement, and (3) electronic content management (e.g., digital document repositories). Other DOD components, including the military services, also maintain some document services capabilities at various locations. House Report 115-200 accompanying a bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2018 included a provision for GAO to examine DOD's document services. This report evaluates (1) the progress DOD has made in achieving efficiencies in its document services and opportunities, if any, to achieve further efficiencies, and (2) the extent to which DOD reports accurate financial information about its document services to key stakeholders. GAO reviewed documents and interviewed officials regarding DOD's efficiency initiatives, including DLA Document Services' transformation plan; reviewed print device procurement contracts and pricing information; and analyzed DOD budget data for fiscal years 2012 through 2016. The Department of Defense (DOD) has taken steps to achieve efficiencies in its document services, including implementing a transformation plan to consolidate existing Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Document Services facilities. However, GAO identified four areas where further gains may be possible: Managing fragmentation in printing and reproduction services. DOD has designated DLA Document Services as the single manager for printing and reproduction services, but DOD customers, citing concerns with DLA's services, have also obtained these services directly from the Government Publishing Office and via in-house print facilities (see fig.). DOD has not assessed DLA's performance in this role or whether additional efficiencies may be possible in light of DLA's transformation plan. Reducing overlap in procuring print devices. GAO found that DOD components used at least four different contract sources to acquire print devices. DOD has not assessed which acquisition approach represents the best value; doing so might better position DOD to further reduce its costs. Meeting goals to reduce the number of print devices. DOD and the military services have not demonstrated that they achieved established goals for reducing the number of print devices. Additional controls and assignment of oversight responsibilities to monitor progress could better enable DOD to achieve its cost savings goals, estimated to be millions of dollars annually. Consolidating DLA facilities. DLA is closing or consolidating 74 of its 112 facilities in the United States. However, GAO found that for four of seven types of specialty services, DLA plans to retain facilities that are responsible for less than 5 percent of the total revenue for each of those specialties, which suggests that further consolidations are possible. DOD includes the cost of non-printing activities, such as the purchase of advertising time for recruiting, within its budget materials for printing and reproduction. It does not include costs to acquire print devices and for electronic content management. As a result, DOD and the Congress lack the oversight into total document services costs needed to make informed decisions. GAO is making six recommendations, including that DOD evaluate options to achieve additional cost savings and other efficiencies in its document services and report more accurate budget data.

{"pred": " \n\nThe Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) establishes minimum wage and overtime pay requirements for most private and public sector employees, except those in executive, administrative, and professional (EAP) positions, who are exempt from overtime pay. The Department of Labor (DOL) defines and delimits the EAP exemptions through regulations. To qualify for the EAP exemption, an employee must meet three criteria: a predetermined and fixed salary, performing executive, administrative, or professional duties, and earning above a certain salary threshold. The salary threshold has been updated nine times since the FLSA's enactment in 1938. The 2019 proposed rule aims to increase the salary level test from $455 per week to $679 per week, and the annual salary threshold for highly compensated employees (HCE) from $100,000 to $147,414. The proposed rule would also allow up to 10% of the standard salary level to be comprised of nondiscretionary bonuses, incentives, and commissions. The 2019 proposed rule would implement a commitment by DOL to update the EAP salary level thresholds every four years. The rule is expected to affect approximately 4.9 million workers, with about 1.3 million becoming newly entitled to overtime pay and an additional 3.6 million receiving strengthened overtime protections. The current 2016 final rule, which was invalidated, was projected to affect approximately 13.1 million workers. The proposed rule would expand overtime coverage to EAP employees through a higher salary level threshold rather than through additional classes of employees. The 2019 proposed rule would also establish a 20th percentile of weekly earnings in the lowest-wage Census region and a 90th percentile of annual earnings nationally as the standard and HCE salary levels, respectively, starting in 2020. The proposed rule would require documentation of all reviews of providers' clinical care after concerns have been raised and establish a timeliness requirement for initiating such reviews. VHA policy does not require VA medical centers to document all types of reviews of providers' clinical care, including retrospective reviews, and VHA has not established a timeliness requirement for initiating reviews of providers' clinical care.

Among other protections, the FLSA establishes that covered nonexempt employees must be compensated at one-and-a-half times their regular rate of pay for each hour worked over 40 hours in a workweek. The FLSA also establishes certain exemptions from its general labor market standards. One of the major exemptions to the overtime provisions in the FLSA is for bona fide \"executive, administrative, and professional\" employees (the \"EAP\" or \"white collar\" exemptions). The FLSA grants authority to the Secretary of Labor to define and delimit the EAP exemption \"from time to time.\" To qualify for this exemption from the FLSA's overtime pay requirement, an employee must be salaried (the \"salary basis\" test); perform specified executive, administrative, or professional duties (the \"duties\" test); and earn above an established salary level threshold (the \"salary level\" test). In March 2019, the Secretary of Labor published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to make changes to the EAP exemptions. The 2019 proposed rule would become effective around January 2020. The major changes in the 2019 proposed rule include increasing the standard salary level threshold from the previous level of $455 per week to $679 per week and committing the Department of Labor (DOL) to updating the EAP exemptions every four years through the rulemaking process. The 2019 proposed rule does not change the duties and responsibilities that employees must perform to be exempt. Thus, the 2019 proposed rule would affect EAP employees at salary levels between $455 and $679 per week in 2020.

About half of the people who reported misusing prescription drugs in 2015 received them from a friend or relative. One way to help prevent this kind of diversion and potential misuse is by providing secure and convenient ways to dispose of unused, unneeded, or expired prescription medications. The Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010 authorizes pharmacies and other entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances to also collect unused prescription drugs for disposal. In 2014, DEA finalized regulations for the implementation of the Act, establishing a voluntary process for eligible entities to become authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs using disposal bins. GAO was asked to review participation among authorized collectors that maintain disposal bins. In this report GAO describes (1) participation rates among entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs and (2) factors that affect participation. GAO analyzed the most currently available DEA data from April 2017 on entities eligible to participate and those participating as authorized collectors. GAO also conducted interviews with DEA officials and a nongeneralizable sample of 11 stakeholder organizations selected to illustrate different types of authorized collectors and long-term care facilities. GAO is not making any recommendations. DEA provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. GAO found that about 3 percent of pharmacies and other entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs for disposal have volunteered to do so. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) authorizes these entities to dispose of unused drugs to help reduce their potential misuse. Analysis of DEA data shows that as of April 2017, 2,233 of the 89,550 (2.49 percent) eligible entities—that is, certain entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances—had registered with DEA to use disposal bins to collect unused prescription drugs. Most—about 81 percent—of the authorized collectors were pharmacies, followed by hospitals or clinics. GAO also found that participation rates varied by state, though in 44 states less than 5 percent of the state's pharmacies and other eligible entities had registered to become authorized collectors. Stakeholders cited several factors that may explain why relatively few pharmacies and other eligible entities have registered with DEA as authorized collectors of unused drugs. Most notably, stakeholders representing authorized collectors told GAO that because participation is voluntary, the cost associated with maintaining a disposal bin—which includes purchasing and installing the bin according to DEA requirements and paying for the destruction of its contents—is an important factor to weigh against potential benefits.

{"pred": " \n\nThe Holman rule, established in 1835, delineates the separation of general legislation from appropriations in the U.S. House of Representatives. Initially, it prohibited any legislative provisions in appropriation bills unless they reduced expenditures. Over time, the rule evolved to permit retrenchments that reduce the number and salary of federal officials, compensation of persons paid from the Treasury, or the amounts of money covered in an appropriation bill. The rule was restructured in 1983 to allow only retrenchments reducing amounts of money covered by the bill. In the 115th Congress, a separate order was adopted to broaden the scope of the Holman rule, permitting reductions in the number and salary of federal officials or compensation of persons paid from the Treasury. This order was not adopted in the 116th Congress, reverting to prior precedents. The Holman rule is intended to limit legislative provisions in appropriation bills to those that reduce expenditures, and it is not meant to expand the scope of the bill. Key evidence includes historical precedents and the text of the Holman rule and the separate order. Unique points include the incremental narrowing of the rule's application and the potential for broader legislative provisions under the 115th Congress order.

These medals, first awarded by the Continental Congress in the late 1700s, are now granted by Congress to honor individuals and groups for their achievements in various fields such as military service, humanitarian efforts, and cultural contributions. There are no permanent statutory provisions specifically relating to the creation of Congressional Gold Medals, and each award is made on an ad hoc basis through legislative action. The process for considering legislation varies between the House and Senate, with no formal rules governing the number of medals that can be awarded in a given year. Key considerations for Members of Congress when deciding to introduce gold medal legislation include selecting appropriate honorees, specifying design elements, and ensuring the medal's placement after it is awarded. The tradition of awarding Congressional Gold Medals continues to be an important way for Congress to express public gratitude and honor significant historical events and achievements. The number of gold medals awarded has increased significantly in recent decades, with an average of nearly twenty medals issued annually in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. The process for awarding these medals involves consultations with the Citizens Coinage Advisory Commission and the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts to ensure the design reflects the significance of the honorees. The flexibility in awarding these medals allows Congress to recognize a wide range of individuals and groups, from military heroes to cultural icons, ensuring that the highest civilian honors are reserved for those who have made exceptional contributions to the nation. The key evidence supporting these conclusions includes historical data on the number of medals awarded, the process for selecting honorees, and the role of advisory commissions in the design process.

Since 1776, this award, which initially was bestowed on military leaders, has also been given to such diverse individuals as Sir Winston Churchill and Bob Hope, George Washington and Robert Frost, Joe Louis and Mother Teresa of Calcutta. Congressional gold medal legislation generally has a specific format. Once a gold medal is authorized, it follows a specific process for design, minting, and awarding. This process includes consultation and recommendations by the Citizens Coinage Advisory Commission (CCAC) and the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts (CFA), pursuant to any statutory instructions, before the Secretary of the Treasury makes the final decision on a gold medal's design. Once the medal has been struck, a ceremony will often be scheduled to formally award the medal to the recipient. In recent years, the number of gold medals awarded has increased, and some have expressed interest in examining the gold medal awarding process. Should Congress want to make such changes, several individual and institutional options might be available. The individual options include decisions made by Members of Congress as to what individual or groups might be honored; potential specification of gold medal design elements; and where gold medals for groups might be housed once the award is made.

Additionally, reviews for 12 providers were not documented at all. Timeliness was also an issue, with 16 providers not having reviews initiated for 3 months to multiple years after concerns were raised. The VA medical centers did not consistently follow VHA policy, which does not require documentation of all types of reviews and lacks timeliness requirements. Network oversight was inadequate, with no routine oversight of reviews. The VA medical centers also failed to report nine providers to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) and state licensing boards as required, despite documenting significant clinical deficiencies. Reporting delays were common, taking over 500 days in some cases. The VA medical centers did not report providers to the NPDB or state licensing boards due to misinterpretations of VHA policy and a lack of network oversight. This led to providers with substandard care continuing to provide care at other VA medical centers or outside of VA's health care system. The GAO recommends that VHA require documentation of all reviews, establish timeliness requirements, and strengthen network oversight to ensure proper reporting to the NPDB and state licensing boards. The VA concurred with these recommendations and plans to revise policy and update the audit tool to address these issues.

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (VAMC) officials are responsible for reviewing the clinical care delivered by their privileged providers—physicians and dentists who are approved to independently perform specific services—after concerns are raised. The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care. For example, GAO found that after one VAMC failed to report to the NPDB or SLBs a provider who resigned to avoid an adverse privileging action, a non-VA hospital in the same city took an adverse privileging action against that same provider for the same reason 2 years later."], "length": 13647}

These munitions have been used by various countries in conflicts, causing significant civilian casualties due to their imprecise dispersion and high failure rates. The text outlines the challenges associated with cluster munitions, including their inability to discriminate between military and civilian targets, the difficulty in detecting unexploded submunitions, and the long-term hazards they pose. The passage also reviews the international efforts to regulate or ban cluster munitions, noting that while some countries have signed the Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM), the United States has not. The U.S. maintains that cluster munitions are essential for military operations and have clear military utility, although it has set a goal of reducing the failure rate to less than 1% of submunitions. The passage concludes by discussing the implications of the U.S. policy on cluster munitions for future military operations and international relations. Key evidence includes failure rate estimates ranging from 2% to 30%, and the high number of unexploded submunitions remaining in conflict zones. Innovative points include the development of \"smart\" or sensor-fuzed submunitions designed to reduce the residual hazard, and the debate over whether cluster munitions are still relevant in an era of precision weapons. The U.S. policy allows for the use of cluster munitions in extreme situations, provided they meet the 1% failure rate standard, and emphasizes the importance of minimizing civilian harm while maintaining military effectiveness. The policy also highlights the ongoing efforts to develop and field new cluster munitions that meet the 1% standard. The passage suggests that the U.S. policy reversal on cluster munitions may have implications for future military treaty initiatives and international perceptions of U.S. military practices. The Consolidated Appropriations Acts impose restrictions on the provision of military assistance for cluster munitions, requiring that submunitions result in no more than 1% unexploded ordnance. The U.S. policy on cluster munitions is subject to annual review and assessment, and the military departments are tasked with planning for the availability of cluster munitions and ensuring their operational quality and reliability. The policy also emphasizes the need to record and retain information on the use of cluster munitions to facilitate the removal or destruction of unexploded submunitions.

Although it may not play the same type of leading political or military role in the Arab world as it has in the past, Egypt may retain some \"soft power\" by virtue of its history, media, and culture. Cairo plays host both to the 22-member Arab League and Al Azhar University, which claims to be the oldest continuously operating university in the world and has symbolic importance as a leading source of Islamic scholarship. Additionally, Egypt's 1979 peace treaty with Israel remains one of the most significant diplomatic achievements for the promotion of Arab-Israeli peace. While people-to-people relations remain cold, the Israeli and Egyptian governments have increased their cooperation against Islamist militants and instability in the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza Strip.

{"pred": " \n\nThe passage discusses the effects of radiation exposure and the approach taken by federal agencies to protect public health. Higher radiation doses can cause immediate effects and increase the risk of cancer, while lower doses pose more uncertain risks. Federal agencies, such as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of Energy (DOE), and Food and Drug Administration (FDA), rely on scientific advisory bodies to set radiation protection standards. These standards are based on the linear no-threshold model, which assumes a proportional increase in cancer risk with radiation exposure. The passage notes that while there is limited data on the effects of low-dose radiation, agencies continue to use this model due to the lack of evidence suggesting benefits or safety at low levels. Funding for research on low-dose radiation has decreased over recent years, and the passage recommends that the Department of Energy (DOE) lead the development of a collaborative mechanism to address research priorities in this area. Despite uncertainties, federal agencies adhere to the principle of minimizing radiation exposure as much as reasonably achievable. The summary highlights the reliance on scientific models for radiation protection, the challenges in quantifying low-dose effects, and the need for continued research and collaboration among agencies. Key evidence includes the use of the linear no-threshold model and the decreasing funding for low-dose radiation research. Unique points include the continued adherence to the linear no-threshold model despite limited data and the recommendation for interagency collaboration to address research priorities. The passage also mentions the specific dose limits set by federal agencies for different groups, such as the general public and nuclear power plant workers, and the principle of keeping radiation exposure as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA). The summary concludes by noting the ongoing efforts to balance scientific uncertainty with protective measures and the importance of continued research to refine these approaches. The passage emphasizes the importance of adhering to scientific models and the need for collaborative research efforts to address uncertainties in low-dose radiation effects. The summary captures the main arguments, key evidence, and unique points from the passage. \n\nSummary of Passage 2:\n\nThe passage details issues with the review and reporting of clinical care by providers at five selected VA medical centers. The centers lacked documentation for nearly half of the required reviews and did not initiate reviews in a timely manner. VHA policy does not mandate documentation for all types of reviews and lacks timeliness requirements. Network oversight is inadequate, leading to insufficient reporting to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) and state licensing boards. The passage recommends that VHA require documentation of all", "answers": ["This testimony summarizes the information contained in GAO's September 2017 report, entitled Low-Dose Radiation: Interagency Collaboration on Planning Research Could Improve Information on Health Effects ( GAO-17-546 ). The Department of Energy (DOE), Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Food and Drug Administration generally used the advice of scientific advisory bodies to develop and apply radiation protection requirements and guidance for workers and the public in the radiation exposure settings that GAO reviewed. These settings were: (1) the operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants; (2) the cleanup of sites with radiological contamination; (3) the use of medical equipment that produces radiation; and (4) accidental or terrorism-related exposure to radiation. Specifically, the agencies relied on the advice of three scientific advisory bodies that supported the use of a model that assumes the risk of cancer increases with every incremental radiation exposure. Accordingly, the agencies have set regulatory dose limits and issued guidance to confine exposure to levels that reduce the risk of cancer, while recognizing that scientific uncertainties occur in estimating cancer risks from low-dose radiation. For example, NRC requires nuclear power plants to consider measures for limiting workers' exposure below NRC's regulatory dose limit, such as by using robots for maintenance work in radiation areas. GAO identified seven federal agencies that funded research on low-dose radiation's health effects. In fiscal years 2012 to 2016, DOE, NRC, EPA, and four other federal agencies obligated about $210 million for such research . Although the agencies have collaborated on individual projects on radiation's health effects, they have not established a collaborative mechanism to set research priorities. GAO's previous work has shown that federal agencies can use such mechanisms to implement interagency collaboration to develop and coordinate sound science policies. In the past, DOE took a leading role in this area because DOE provided stable funding and advocated for greater coordination on research on low-dose radiation's health effects. However, since fiscal year 2012, DOE has phased out funding for one of its main research programs in this area. This has created a void in coordination efforts among federal agencies, and no other agency has stepped forward to fill this void. Because of DOE's prior experience as a leader in this area of research and its research responsibility under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, it could play an important role in helping federal agencies establish a coordinating mechanism for low-dose radiation research.

It operates in areas with school closures, including summer vacation periods and certain other times for areas affected by natural disasters. The program's federal expenditures increased from 2007 to 2016, with a slight decrease in 2015-2016. The SFSP is managed by the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) at the federal level and state agencies at the state level. The program faces challenges such as limited meal site availability, particularly in rural areas, and low participation in non-area eligible regions. Flexibilities and alternative delivery models like mobile meal delivery are used to address these challenges. Despite efforts, the reliability of estimates of children's participation in the SFSP remains questionable due to inconsistencies in data collection methods. Other federal programs, such as the Seamless Summer Option and Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer for Children, also provide meals to low-income children during the summer. Challenges in program administration, including limited state agency staffing and administrative burdens, are also discussed.

In the last decade, federal expenditures for SFSP have increased as the program has expanded, according to USDA data. GAO was asked to review the SFSP. This report examines (1) what is known about SFSP participation, (2) other programs that help feed low-income children over the summer, and (3) challenges, if any, in providing summer meals to children and the extent to which USDA provides assistance to address these challenges. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed USDA's SFSP data for fiscal years 2007 through 2016; surveyed state agencies responsible for administering the SFSP in 50 states and the District of Columbia; visited a nongeneralizable group of 3 states and 30 meal sites, selected based on Census data on child poverty rates and urban and rural locations; analyzed meal site data from the 3 states; and interviewed USDA, state and national organization officials, and SFSP providers, including sponsors and site operators. Nationwide, the total number of meals served to children in low-income areas through the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) increased from 113 to 149 million (about 32 percent) from fiscal year 2007 through 2016. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) directs states to use the number of meals served, along with other data, to estimate the number of children participating in the SFSP. However, participation estimates have been calculated inconsistently from state to state and year to year. In 2017, USDA took steps to improve the consistency of participation estimates, noting they are critical for informing program implementation and strategic planning. However, GAO determined that the method USDA directs states to use will continue to provide unreliable estimates of participation, hindering USDA's ability to use them for these purposes. Other federal and nonfederal programs help feed low-income children over the summer to some extent, according to states GAO surveyed and SFSP providers and others GAO interviewed. For example, in July 2016, USDA data indicate about 26 million meals were served through a separate federal program that allows school meal providers to serve summer meals. Some children also received summer meals through nonfederal programs operated by faith-based organizations and foodbanks, though GAO's state survey and interviews with providers and national organizations indicate the reach of such efforts is limited. States and SFSP providers reported challenges with meal sites, participation, and program administration; USDA has taken steps to address these areas. Specifically, in GAO's survey, a majority of states reported challenges with availability and awareness of meal sites, as well as limited program participation and administrative capacity. National, state, and local officials have taken steps to address these issues, such as increasing outreach and offering activities to attract participation. In addition, 17 states in GAO's survey and providers in the states GAO visited reported a challenge with ensuring meal sites are in safe locations. To address this safety issue, USDA has granted some states and sponsors flexibility from the requirement that children consume meals on-site. However, USDA has not broadly communicated the circumstances it considers when granting this flexibility. Further, some states and sponsors that have requested this flexibility reported difficulty obtaining data to show these circumstances exist, hampering their ability to ensure safe meal delivery. GAO is making four recommendations, including that USDA improve estimates of children's participation in SFSP and communicate the circumstances it considers when granting flexibilities to ensure safe meal delivery.

Other DOD components, including the military services, also maintain some document services capabilities at various locations. House Report 115-200 accompanying a bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2018 included a provision for GAO to examine DOD's document services. This report evaluates (1) the progress DOD has made in achieving efficiencies in its document services and opportunities, if any, to achieve further efficiencies, and (2) the extent to which DOD reports accurate financial information about its document services to key stakeholders. GAO reviewed documents and interviewed officials regarding DOD's efficiency initiatives, including DLA Document Services' transformation plan; reviewed print device procurement contracts and pricing information; and analyzed DOD budget data for fiscal years 2012 through 2016. The Department of Defense (DOD) has taken steps to achieve efficiencies in its document services, including implementing a transformation plan to consolidate existing Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Document Services facilities. However, GAO identified four areas where further gains may be possible: Managing fragmentation in printing and reproduction services. DOD has designated DLA Document Services as the single manager for printing and reproduction services, but DOD customers, citing concerns with DLA's services, have also obtained these services directly from the Government Publishing Office and via in-house print facilities (see fig.). DOD has not assessed DLA's performance in this role or whether additional efficiencies may be possible in light of DLA's transformation plan. Reducing overlap in procuring print devices. GAO found that DOD components used at least four different contract sources to acquire print devices. DOD has not assessed which acquisition approach represents the best value; doing so might better position DOD to further reduce its costs. Meeting goals to reduce the number of print devices. DOD and the military services have not demonstrated that they achieved established goals for reducing the number of print devices. Additional controls and assignment of oversight responsibilities to monitor progress could better enable DOD to achieve its cost savings goals, estimated to be millions of dollars annually. Consolidating DLA facilities. DLA is closing or consolidating 74 of its 112 facilities in the United States. However, GAO found that for four of seven types of specialty services, DLA plans to retain facilities that are responsible for less than 5 percent of the total revenue for each of those specialties, which suggests that further consolidations are possible. DOD includes the cost of non-printing activities, such as the purchase of advertising time for recruiting, within its budget materials for printing and reproduction.

Much of this assistance is provided in areas plagued by conflict or other issues that increase the risk of financial crimes. The World Bank and others have reported that humanitarian assistance organizations face challenges in accessing banking services that could affect project implementation. GAO was asked to review the possible effects of decreased banking access for nonprofit organizations on the delivery of U.S. humanitarian assistance. In this report, GAO examines (1) the extent to which State and USAID partners experienced banking access challenges, (2) USAID partners' reporting on such challenges, and (3) actions U.S. agencies have taken to help address such challenges. GAO selected four high-risk countries—Syria, Somalia, Haiti, and Kenya—based on factors such as their inclusion in multiple financial risk-related indices, and selected a non-generalizable sample of 18 projects in those countries. GAO reviewed documentation and interviewed U.S. officials and the 18 partners for the selected projects. Implementing partners (partners) for 7 of 18 Department of State (State) and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) humanitarian assistance projects that GAO selected noted encountering banking access challenges, such as delays or denials in transferring funds overseas. Of those 7 projects, 1 partner told us that banking access challenges adversely affected its project and 2 additional partners told us that the challenges had the potential for adverse effects. Moreover, the majority of partners (15 out of 18) for the 18 projects noted experiencing banking access challenges on their global portfolio of projects over the previous 5 years. USAID's partners' written reports do not capture potential risks posed by banking access challenges because USAID generally does not require most partners to report in writing any challenges that do not affect implementation. Six of the 7 projects that encountered challenges were USAID-funded. Of those 6 USAID projects, 5 partners told us that these challenges did not rise to the threshold of affecting project implementation that would necessitate reporting, and 1 did not report challenges although its project was adversely affected. Additionally, GAO's review of about 1,300 USAID partner reports found that the few instances where challenges were mentioned lacked sufficient detail for GAO to determine their type, severity, or origin. Without information on banking access challenges that pose potential risks to project implementation, USAID is not aware of the full extent of risks to achieving its objectives. The Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and State have taken various actions to help address banking access challenges encountered by nonprofit organizations (NPO), but USAID's efforts have been limited. Treasury's efforts have focused on engagement between NPOs and U.S. agencies, while State has issued guidance on the topic to its embassies and designated an office to focus on these issues. In contrast, USAID lacks a comparable office, and NPOs stated that it is difficult to find USAID staff to engage with on this topic. Further, GAO found that awareness of specific challenges was generally limited to USAID staff directly overseeing the project. Without communicating these challenges to relevant parties, USAID may not be aware of all risks to agency objectives and may not be able to effectively engage with external entities on efforts to address these challenges. GAO recommends that USAID should take steps to (1) collect information on banking access challenges experienced by USAID's partners and (2) communicate that information both within USAID and with external entities, such as other U.S. agencies and partners. USAID concurred with our recommendations."], "length": 12093}

The VA medical centers did not always conduct reviews in a timely manner, and VHA policy did not require documentation of all types of reviews or establish timeliness requirements. VHA's inadequate oversight of the reviews contributed to the problem. The VA medical centers also failed to report nine providers to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) and state licensing boards as required, due to misinterpretation of VHA policies and lack of network oversight. This led to providers with substandard care remaining eligible to provide care at other VA medical centers or outside of VA's health care system. Recommendations were made for VHA to require documentation of all reviews, establish timeliness requirements, and strengthen oversight to ensure compliance with policies. The VA concurred with the recommendations and plans to implement them. Key evidence included documentation showing that reviews were not conducted and providers were not reported as required, and interviews with VA officials. Unique points included the lack of network oversight and the potential for providers with substandard care to obtain privileges at other facilities. The VA's failure to report providers to the NPDB and state licensing boards facilitated this issue. The GAO recommended that VHA require networks to establish a process for overseeing VA medical centers to ensure timely reporting to the NPDB and state licensing boards.

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (VAMC) officials are responsible for reviewing the clinical care delivered by their privileged providers—physicians and dentists who are approved to independently perform specific services—after concerns are raised. The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care. For example, GAO found that after one VAMC failed to report to the NPDB or SLBs a provider who resigned to avoid an adverse privileging action, a non-VA hospital in the same city took an adverse privileging action against that same provider for the same reason 2 years later."], "length": 13187}
{"pred": " \n\nThe federal government operates four regional power marketing administrations (PMAs): Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), Southeastern Power Administration (SEPA), Southwestern Power Administration (SWPA), and Western Area Power Administration (WAPA). Each PMA markets electricity from federal dams and has unique characteristics and challenges. BPA, the first PMA, is self-financed and markets power from 31 federal hydropower facilities in the Pacific Northwest. SEPA, the smallest PMA, markets power from 22 Corps-operated facilities and faces an overcapacity issue. SWPA, serving six states, manages nearly 1,400 miles of transmission lines and uses alternative financing to minimize congressional appropriations. WAPA, the largest PMA, serves 15 western states and has been working on transmission development needs. Recent challenges include drought affecting hydropower generation and proposals to sell transmission assets, which could impact the lowest possible rates and statutory preferences for public or cooperative utilities. Key evidence includes financial data and projections, and legal provisions regulating the PMAs' operations. Unique points include the potential for WAPA to join a Regional Transmission Organization and the Trump Administration's proposal to sell federal transmission assets. The PMAs' roles and challenges highlight the complex interplay between federal power generation and distribution, environmental concerns, and economic considerations. The proposals to sell transmission assets raise questions about the federal government's role in power distribution and the potential for increased private sector involvement.

Each PMA operates in a distinct geographic area. Congressional interest in the PMAs has included diverse issues such as rate setting, cost and compliance associated with the Endangered Species Act (ESA; P.L. 93-205; 16 U.S.C. §§1531 et seq.), and questions of privatization of these federal agencies. In general, the PMAs came into being because of the government's need to dispose of electric power produced by dams constructed largely for irrigation, flood control, or other purposes, and to achieve small community and farm electrification—that is, providing service to customers whom it would not have been profitable for a private utility to serve. With minor exceptions, these agencies market the electric power produced by federal dams constructed, owned, and operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) and the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR). By statute, PMAs must give preference to public utility districts and cooperatives (e.g., \"preference customers\"), and sell their power at cost-based rates set at the lowest possible rate consistent with sound business principles. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulates PMA rates to ensure that they are set high enough to repay the U.S. Treasury for the portion of federal facility costs allocated to hydropower beneficiaries. With energy and capacity markets changing in the western United States (especially with the growing need to integrate increasing amounts of variable renewable sources), and the development of the Energy Imbalance Market in the West, BPA and WAPA may have to adapt their plans with regard to generation needs and how transmission systems are developed. In 2018, the Trump Administration proposed to sell the transmission assets (lines, towers, substations, and/or rights of way) owned and operated by the federal Power Marketing Administrations. The proposal suggested that \"eliminating or reducing\" the federal government's role in owning and operating transmission assets, and increasing the private sector's role, would \"encourage a more efficient allocation of economic resources and mitigate unnecessary risk to taxpayers.\" The resulting PMA entities would then contract with other utilities to provide transmission services for the delivery of federal power, similar to what SEPA does currently. Reportedly, the proposed sale of PMA assets was dropped after opposition to the plan emerged from stakeholders. Under Section 208 of the Urgent Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1986 (P.L. 99-349), the executive branch is prohibited from spending funds to study or draft proposals to transfer from federal control any portion of the assets of the PMAs unless specifically authorized by Congress. Environmental, fishing, and tribal advocates have sued the federal government over concerns that operating rules for hydropower dams on the Columbia and Snake Rivers (i.e., the National Marine Fisheries Service Biological Opinion) are inadequate to ensure survival of species threatened or endangered under the ESA. In 2016, a federal judge overturned a previous management plan for the dams, finding that it would not be sufficient to protect salmon runs, and ordered a new management plan that could include removing the dams. However, in 2018, President Trump issued a Presidential Memorandum accelerating the process for a new management plan, requiring the biological opinion to be ready by 2020. Since FY2011, power revenues associated with the PMAs have been classified as discretionary offsetting receipts (i.e., receipts that are available for spending by the PMAs), thus the agencies are sometimes noted as having a \"net-zero\" spending authority. Only the capital expenses of WAPA and SWPA require appropriations from Congress."], "length": 13908}

Key findings include that almost half of the required reviews were not documented, and in some cases, reviews were not conducted at all. Specifically, focused professional practice evaluations (FPPEs) for cause were lacking for 26 providers, and retrospective reviews for 8 providers. Additionally, reviews were delayed for 16 providers for up to multiple years. The report attributes these issues to insufficient documentation requirements and inadequate oversight by VHA. Recommendations include requiring documentation of all reviews, establishing timeliness requirements, and strengthening oversight by networks. The report also highlights that only one of nine providers required to be reported to the NPDB was actually reported, and that reporting to state licensing boards was delayed in some cases. This led to concerns about providers with substandard care obtaining privileges at other facilities. Recommendations to address this include requiring networks to oversee timely reporting to the NPDB and state licensing boards. The report concludes that VHA lacks reasonable assurance that all providers with clinical deficiencies are appropriately reported and that this can facilitate substandard care providers obtaining privileges at other facilities. The report provides detailed evidence and examples to support these findings and recommendations. The report emphasizes the importance of proper documentation and timely reviews for ensuring patient safety and maintaining high standards of care. The report also notes that misinterpretations of VHA policies by VA medical center officials contributed to the lack of reporting. The report recommends that VHA strengthen its oversight to ensure compliance with policies and to prevent substandard care providers from obtaining privileges at other facilities. The report concludes that VHA must take action to address these issues to protect veterans and maintain the integrity of the VA healthcare system.

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (VAMC) officials are responsible for reviewing the clinical care delivered by their privileged providers—physicians and dentists who are approved to independently perform specific services—after concerns are raised. The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care. For example, GAO found that after one VAMC failed to report to the NPDB or SLBs a provider who resigned to avoid an adverse privileging action, a non-VA hospital in the same city took an adverse privileging action against that same provider for the same reason 2 years later."], "length": 12336}

These gaps can range from a single day to multiple weeks and significantly disrupt government operations. The Antideficiency Act generally prohibits the obligation or expenditure of federal funds without appropriations, leading agencies to cease operations and furlough non-excepted personnel during funding gaps. The Civiletti opinions, issued in 1980 and 1981, clarified that agencies can incur obligations for the safety of human life or the protection of property but generally cannot continue operations. Historical data from FY1977 to FY2019 shows that funding gaps have led to substantial disruptions, particularly in recent years. The passage provides detailed accounts of specific funding gaps, their impacts, and resolutions. Innovative solutions, such as automatic continuing resolutions, have been proposed but not enacted. Key evidence includes the frequency and duration of funding gaps, the impact", "answers": ["The Antideficiency Act (31 U.S.C. 1341-1342, 1511-1519) generally bars the obligation of funds in the absence of appropriations. Exceptions are made under the act, including for activities involving \"the safety of human life or the protection of property.\" The interval during the fiscal year when appropriations for a particular project or activity are not enacted into law, either in the form of a regular appropriations act or a continuing resolution (CR), is referred to as a funding gap or funding lapse. Although funding gaps may occur at the start of the fiscal year, they may also occur any time a CR expires and another CR (or the regular appropriations bill) is not enacted immediately thereafter. Multiple funding gaps may occur within a fiscal year. When a funding gap occurs, federal agencies are generally required to begin a shutdown of the affected projects and activities, which includes the prompt furlough of non-excepted personnel. The general practice of the federal government after the shutdown has ended has been to retroactively pay furloughed employees for the time they missed, as well as employees who were required to come to work. Although a shutdown may be the result of a funding gap, the two events should be distinguished. This is because a funding gap may result in a total shutdown of all affected projects or activities in some instances but not others. For example, when funding gaps are of a short duration, agencies may not have enough time to complete a shutdown of affected projects and activities before funding is restored. In addition, the Office of Management and Budget has previously indicated that a shutdown of agency operations within the first day of the funding gap may be postponed if a resolution appears to be imminent. Since FY1977, 20 funding gaps occurred, ranging in duration from 1 day to 34 full days. These funding gaps are listed in Table 1. About half of these funding gaps were brief (i.e., three days or less in duration). Notably, many of the funding gaps do not appear to have resulted in a \"shutdown.\" Prior to the issuance of the opinions in 1980 and early 1981 by then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti, while agencies tended to curtail some operations in response to a funding gap, they often \"continued to operate during periods of expired funding.\" In addition, some of the funding gaps after the Civiletti opinions did not result in a completion of shutdown operations due to both the funding gap's short duration and an expectation that appropriations would soon be enacted. Some of the funding gaps during this period, however, did have a broader impact on affected government operations, even if only for a matter of hours. Two funding gaps occurred in FY1996, amounting to 5 days and 21 days. The chronology of regular and continuing appropriations enacted during FY1996 is illustrated in Figure 1. At the beginning of FY2014 (October 1, 2013), none of the regular appropriations bills had been enacted, so a government-wide funding gap occurred. It concluded on October 17, 2013, after lasting 16 full days. During FY2018, there was a funding gap when a CR covering all of the regular appropriations bills expired on January 19, 2018. It concluded on January 22, 2018, after lasting two full days. The most recent funding gap occurred during FY2019, when a CR covering federal agencies and activities funded in 7 of the 12 regular appropriations bills expired on December 21, 2018. It concluded on January 25, 2019, after lasting 34 full days.

{"pred": " \n\nThe passage discusses the implementation of the CHIP-IN Act, which allows for the use of private donations to fund VA construction projects. Key factors driving the initiative included the VA's need for expedient construction methods and the desire to test innovative approaches to addressing infrastructure needs. The Omaha donor group secured a donation agreement for an ambulatory care center, resulting in potential cost and time savings. However, the pilot faces challenges such as the reliance on large philanthropic donations, limited donor pool, and the need for more marketing and philanthropic development expertise. Additionally, the pilot lacks clear objectives, an assessment methodology, and an evaluation plan, which could hinder VA's ability to scale the program or provide information to Congress about its results. Recommendations were made for VA to define clear objectives, develop an assessment methodology and evaluation plan, and document roles and responsibilities for the CHIP-IN steering committee. The passage highlights the importance of structured pilot design to ensure successful implementation and scalability. Key evidence includes the potential cost savings of $34 million for the Omaha project and the need for a dedicated implementation team. Unique points include the emphasis on stakeholder communication and the potential for private sector practices to enhance VA construction projects. The passage concludes by emphasizing the need for a strengthened pilot design to support VA and Congress in making informed decisions about the program's future. The main argument is that while the CHIP-IN pilot has shown potential benefits, it requires improvements in design and implementation to achieve its full potential.

The Communities Helping Invest through Property and Improvements Needed for Veterans Act of 2016 (CHIP-IN Act) authorized VA to accept donated real property—such as buildings or facility construction or improvements—through a pilot program. VA has initiated one project in Omaha, Nebraska, through a partnership with a donor group. VA can accept up to five donations through the pilot program, which is authorized through 2021. The CHIP-IN Act includes a provision for GAO to report on donation agreements. This report (1) examines the extent to which the VA's pilot design aligns with leading practices and (2) discusses what VA has learned from the pilot to date. GAO reviewed VA documents, including plans for the pilot program, and visited the Omaha pilot project. GAO interviewed VA officials, the Omaha donor group, and three non-federal entities that responded to VA's request seeking donors. GAO compared implementation of VA's pilot to leading practices for pilot design, organizational transformation, and cross-functional teams. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is conducting a pilot program, called CHIP-IN, that allows VA to partner with non-federal entities and accept real property donations from them as a way to help address VA's infrastructure needs. Although VA signed its first project agreement under the program in April 2017, VA has not yet established a framework for effective design of the pilot program. Specifically, VA's pilot program design is not aligned with four of five leading practices for designing a well-developed and documented pilot program. VA has begun to implement one leading practice by improving its efforts to communicate with relevant stakeholders, such as including external stakeholders in key meetings. However, the VA offices involved have not agreed upon and documented clear, measurable objectives for the pilot program, which is a leading practice. Further, VA has not developed an assessment methodology or an evaluation plan that would help inform decisions about whether or how the pilot approach could be expanded. While VA officials said they intend to develop these items as tasks for the newly formed CHIP-IN steering committee, they have no timeline for doing so. Without clear objectives and assessment and evaluation plans, VA and Congress may have difficulty determining whether the pilot approach is an effective way to help address VA's infrastructure needs. To date, the CHIP-IN pilot suggests that donation partnerships could improve construction projects, but identifying donors and establishing a team for the pilot program have presented challenges. Officials from VA and the donor group for the first pilot project—an ambulatory care center in Omaha, Nebraska—said they are completing the project faster than if it had been a standard federal construction project, while achieving potential cost savings by using private sector practices. However, VA officials said it is challenging to find partners to make large donations with no financial return, and VA's lack of marketing and philanthropic development experience exacerbates that challenge. VA and the donor group agreed that a dedicated team of individuals with relevant expertise could facilitate the pilot's implementation. The new CHIP-IN steering committee could serve this purpose, but it lacks documented roles and responsibilities. Establishing a team with clear roles and responsibilities and identifying both available and needed staff resources could assist VA in partnering with additional donors and creating new opportunities to meet veterans' needs.

{"pred": " \n\nThe rise of e-commerce has transformed the market for counterfeit goods, shifting sales from underground markets to primary markets like e-commerce websites, corporate supply chains, and traditional retail stores. This transition has enabled counterfeiters to adopt new deceptive tactics, such as exploiting third-party online marketplaces and setting prices near those of authentic goods. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have observed a significant increase in the volume and variety of counterfeit goods, with a notable rise in express carrier and international mail shipments. The CBP's seizure data indicates a 38% increase in Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) seizures from 2012 to 2016, with China and Hong Kong being the primary sources. Counterfeit goods are now found in almost every industry, and the methods of importation have shifted towards smaller, more frequent shipments to evade detection. The risks associated with counterfeit goods extend beyond intellectual property infringement, as some items may pose health and safety hazards. While rights holders and e-commerce websites have taken steps to protect IP, such as maintaining IPR protection teams and removing counterfeit listings, the complexity of the online marketplace makes it challenging to identify and investigate individual cases. The CBP and ICE have engaged in various IPR enforcement activities, but limited evaluation of these efforts suggests a need for more systematic assessment to ensure resource allocation is optimized. The passage highlights the evolving nature of the counterfeit goods market and the challenges faced by law enforcement and the private sector in combating this issue. Key evidence includes CBP seizure data, the increasing sophistication of counterfeit goods, and the shift towards smaller, more frequent shipments. Unique points include the difficulty in distinguishing between legitimate and counterfeit goods due to the increasing sophistication of counterfeits and the need for enhanced information sharing between CBP, ICE, and the private sector to effectively combat the problem. The CBP and ICE have taken steps to collaborate more effectively, but there is room for improvement in terms of information sharing and evaluation of their enforcement activities. The passage concludes by recommending that the CBP assess what additional information would be beneficial to share with the private sector and take action to enhance information sharing where possible. The CBP concurred with this recommendation.

Changes in the market for counterfeit goods entering the United States pose new challenges for consumers, the private sector, and U.S. agencies that enforce intellectual property rights (IPR). Specifically, growth in e-commerce has contributed to a shift in the sale of counterfeit goods in the United States, with consumers increasingly purchasing goods online and counterfeiters producing a wider variety of goods that may be sold on websites alongside authentic products. For example, 20 of 47 items GAO purchased from third-party sellers on popular consumer websites were counterfeit, according to testing by the products' rights holders (see table), highlighting potential risks to consumers. The changes in the market for counterfeit goods can also pose challenges to the private sector—for example, the challenge of distinguishing counterfeit from authentic goods listed for sale online—and complicate the enforcement efforts of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). CBP and ICE engage in a number of activities to enhance IPR enforcement; however, while ICE has assessed some of its efforts, CBP has taken limited steps to do so. CBP's and ICE's IPR enforcement activities broadly include detecting imports of potentially IPR-infringing goods, conducting special operations at U.S. ports, engaging with international partners, and undertaking localized pilot programs or port-led initiatives. CBP and ICE have collected some performance data for each of the eight activities GAO reviewed, and ICE has taken some steps to understand the impact of its efforts. However, CBP has conducted limited evaluation of its efforts to enhance IPR enforcement. Consequently, CBP may lack information needed to ensure it is investing its resources in the most efficient and effective activities. CBP and ICE generally collaborate on IPR enforcement, but according to private sector representatives, restrictions on CBP's information sharing limit private sector enforcement efforts. GAO found that CBP and ICE have undertaken efforts that align with selected key practices for interagency collaboration, such as participating in developing a national IPR enforcement strategy and agreeing on roles and responsibilities. However, sharing additional information about seized items with rights-holding companies and e-commerce websites could improve enforcement, according to private sector representatives. CBP officials said they share information to the extent allowed under current regulations, but CBP has not completed an assessment of what, if any, additional information would be beneficial to share with private sector entities.

These reports must be publicly available and include details such as the client, lobbying issues, income, and expenses. The LDA defines a lobbyist as someone who engages in lobbying activities representing at least 20% of their time for a client. The Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House provide guidance and assistance to lobbyists, and the U.S. Attorney's Office (USAO) enforces compliance. From 2010 to 2017, most lobbyists provided documentation for income and expenses, with a notable increase in 2017. Challenges to compliance include confusion about rounding requirements, incomplete disclosures of covered positions, and difficulties in locating lobbyists who have left their firms. The USAO has sufficient resources to enforce the LDA but faces challenges in locating non-compliant lobbyists. The LDA requires lobbyists to disclose previously held covered positions, and in 2017, 15% of reports may not have properly disclosed these positions. The USAO tracks referrals and focuses on resolving \"responded but not compliant\" and \"no response/waiting for a response\" cases. The LDA also requires lobbyists to report political contributions semiannually, and in 2017, 12% of reports failed to disclose contributions. The USAO investigates chronic offenders and takes enforcement actions, including civil penalties.

This is GAO's 11th report under the provision. GAO reviewed a stratified random sample of 98 quarterly disclosure LD-2 reports filed for the third and fourth quarters of calendar year 2016 and the first and second quarters of calendar year 2017. GAO also reviewed two random samples totaling 160 LD-203 reports from year-end 2016 and midyear 2017. This methodology allowed GAO to generalize to the population of 45,818 disclosure reports with $5,000 or more in lobbying activity, and 30,594 reports of federal political campaign contributions. GAO also met with officials from USAO to obtain status updates on its efforts to focus resources on lobbyists who fail to comply. GAO is not making any recommendations in this report. GAO provided a draft of this report to the Department of Justice for review and comment. The Department of Justice provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. For the 2017 reporting period, most lobbyists provided documentation for key elements of their disclosure reports to demonstrate compliance with the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995, as amended (LDA). For lobbying disclosure (LD-2) reports and political contributions (LD-203) reports filed during the third and fourth quarter of 2016 and the first and second quarter of 2017, GAO estimates that 87 percent of lobbyists filed reports as required for the quarter in which they first registered; the figure below describes the filing process and enforcement; 99 percent of all lobbyists who filed (up from 83 percent in 2016) could provide documentation for income and expenses; and 93 percent filed year-end 2016 LD-203 reports as required. These findings are generally consistent with prior reports GAO issued for the 2010 through 2016 reporting periods. However, in recent years GAO's findings showed some variation in the estimated percentage of reports with supporting documentation. For example, an estimated increase in lobbyists who could document expenses is notable in 2017 and represents a statistically significant increase from 2016. As in GAO's other reports, some lobbyists were still unclear about the need to disclose certain previously held covered positions, such as paid congressional internships or certain executive agency positions. GAO estimates that 15 percent of all LD-2 reports may not have properly disclosed previously held covered positions. On the other hand, over the past several years of reporting on lobbying disclosure, GAO found that most lobbyists in the sample rated the terms associated with LD-2 reporting as “very easy” or “somewhat easy” to understand.

The Senate report also included a provision for GAO to assess DOD's report, which DOD submitted to Congress in April 2017. This report examines the extent to which DOD's report addressed the prescribed congressional elements. GAO reviewed DOD's report and compared it to the prescribed elements, examined documents relevant to DOD's cost estimating and comparison methodology, and interviewed DOD officials, including those in its Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation responsible for the calculations in DOD's report. In response to Congressional direction, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a report in April 2017 comparing the costs of federal civilian and service contractor personnel at select installations. The report addressed three out of four provision elements and partially addressed one, as discussed below. DOD concluded that neither federal civilians nor service contractors were predominately more or less expensive, with costs being dependent on position, location, and level of seniority. DOD noted that it used a non-probability based sample of personnel for its report, and the results are not generalizable. An assessment of performance of functions being performed by federal civilian and service contractor personnel at six military installations, with four being in the continental United States and two being outside the continental United States.

House Report Number 3128 included a provision for GAO to assess the risks of DHS using IBC in connection with its modernization efforts. This report examines (1) the extent to which DHS and the TRIO components followed best practices in analyzing alternatives, and the key factors, metrics, and processes used in their choice of a modernized financial management system; (2) the extent to which DHS managed the risks of using IBC for its TRIO project consistent with risk management best practices; and (3) the key factors and challenges that have impacted the TRIO project and DHS's plans for completing remaining key priorities. GAO interviewed key officials, reviewed relevant documents, and determined whether DHS followed best practices identified by GAO as necessary characteristics of a reliable, high-quality AOA process and other risk management best practices. The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) TRIO project represents a key effort to address long-standing financial management system deficiencies. During 2012 and 2013, the TRIO components—U.S. Coast Guard (Coast Guard), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO)—each completed an alternatives analysis (AA) to determine a preferred alternative for modernizing its financial management system. GAO found that DNDO's AA substantially met the four characteristics—well-documented, comprehensive, unbiased, and credible—that GAO previously identified for a reliable, high-quality analysis of alternatives (AOA) process. However, Coast Guard's and TSA's AAs did not fully or substantially meet three of these characteristics, and DHS guidance for conducting AAs did not substantially incorporate certain best practices, such as identifying significant risks and mitigation strategies and performing an independent review to help validate the AOA process. Based on these analyses and other factors, the TRIO components determined that migrating to a federal shared service provider (SSP) represented the best alternative, and in 2014, DHS selected the Department of the Interior's Interior Business Center (IBC) as the federal SSP for the project. However, because Coast Guard's and TSA's AAs did not fully or substantially reflect all of the characteristics noted above, they are at increased risk that the alternative selected may not achieve mission needs. DHS also did not fully follow best practices for managing project risks related to its use of IBC on the TRIO project. Specifically, DHS followed three of seven risk management best practices, such as determining risk sources and categories and establishing a risk management strategy. However, it did not fully follow four best practices for defining risk parameters, identifying risks, developing risk mitigation plans, and implementing these plans largely because its guidance did not sufficiently address these best practices. For example, although DHS created joint teams with IBC and provided additional resources to IBC to help address risk mitigation concerns, it did not always develop sufficiently detailed risk mitigation plans that also included contingency plans for selected critical risks. As a result, although IBC's capacity and experience for migrating large agencies the size of Coast Guard and TSA was identified as a risk in July 2014, a contingency plan working group to address this concern was not established until January 2017. By not fully following risk management best practices, DHS is at increased risk that potential problems may not be identified or properly mitigated. DHS, IBC, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and other federal oversight agencies identified various challenges that have impacted the TRIO project and contributed to a 2-year delay in the implementation of Coast Guard's and TSA's modernized solutions. These challenges include the lack of sufficient resources, aggressive schedule, complex requirements, increased costs, and project management and communication concerns. To help address these challenges, DHS and IBC established review teams and have taken other steps to assess potential mitigating steps.

AIP funding is distributed based on a formula that considers the number of passengers boarding at an airport, with larger airports receiving more funds. The trust fund, which finances AIP, relies on various aviation-related taxes. Since 1990, PFCs have been allowed to supplement AIP funding, particularly at larger airports. Airport bonds, often tax-exempt, are another significant source of funding. The federal government aims to balance capacity, safety, and noise reduction while addressing the varying needs of different airport sizes and types. Funding levels and distribution methods have evolved over time, with recent legislation providing increased funding and more flexibility for smaller airports. Key evidence includes the distribution of AIP grants by airport type and project, the growth in PFC collections, and the increasing reliance on airport bonds. Unique points include the requirement for large and medium hub airports to forgo a portion of their AIP funds when imposing PFCs, and the potential for airports to privatize under certain conditions. The legislative history of AIP funding shows a gradual evolution from local responsibility to federal support, with adjustments made to address changing needs and priorities. The most recent reauthorization of AIP in 2018 provided stable funding through 2023 and introduced new provisions to enhance flexibility and support for smaller airports.

Federal involvement is most consequential in AIP, PFCs, and tax-exempt financing. The AIP has been providing federal grants for airport development and planning since the passage of the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 (P.L. 97-248). AIP funding is usually spent on projects that support aircraft operations such as runways, taxiways, aprons, noise abatement, land purchase, and safety or emergency equipment. The funds obligated for AIP are drawn from the airport and airway trust fund, which is supported by a variety of user fees and fuel taxes. Different airports use different combinations of these sources depending on the individual airport's financial situation and the type of project being considered. Although smaller airports' individual grants are of much smaller dollar amounts than the grants going to large and medium hub airports, the smaller airports are much more dependent on AIP to meet their capital needs. This is particularly the case for noncommercial airports, which received over 25% of AIP grants distributed in FY2018. Larger airports are much more likely to issue tax-exempt bonds or finance capital projects with the proceeds of PFCs. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-254) provided annual AIP funding of $3.35 billion from the airport and airway trust fund for five years from FY2019 to FY2023. The act left the basic structure of AIP unchanged, but authorized supplemental annual funding of over $1 billion from the general fund to the AIP discretionary funds, starting with $1.02 billion in FY2019, and required at least 50% of the additional discretionary funds to be available to nonhub and small hub airports. The act included a provision permitting eligible projects at small airports (including those in the State Block Grant Program) to receive a 95% federal share of project costs (otherwise capped at 90%), if such projects are determined to be successive phases of a multiphase construction project that received a grant in FY2011. The 2018 reauthorization expanded the number of states that could participate in the State Block Grant Program from 10 to 20 and also expanded the existing airport privatization pilot program (now renamed the Airport Investment Partnership Program) to include more than 10 airports. The law included a provision that forbids states or local governments from levying or collecting taxes on a business at an airport that \"is not generally imposed on sales or services by that State, political subdivision, or authority unless wholly utilized for airport or aeronautical purposes.\" The airport improvement issues Congress generally faces in the context of FAA reauthorization include the following: Should airport development funding be increased or decreased? Should the $4.50 ceiling on PFCs be eliminated, raised, or kept as it is? Could AIP be restructured to address congestion at the busiest U.S. airports, or should a large share of AIP resources continue to go to noncommercial airports that lack other sources of funding? Should Congress set tighter limits on the purposes for which AIP and PFC funds may be spent?

The rule originated in 1835 to prevent delays in enacting appropriations due to the inclusion of non-appropriation-related legislation. Over time, the rule evolved to allow retrenchments—reductions in expenditures—by reducing the number and salary of federal officials, the compensation of individuals paid from the Treasury, or the amounts of money covered in an appropriation bill. The rule was restructured in 1983 to narrow its exception, allowing only retrenchments reducing amounts of money covered by the bill. In the 115th Congress, a separate order was adopted to further broaden the exception, permitting reductions in the number and salary of federal officials or the compensation of individuals paid from the Treasury. Key evidence includes precedents and rulings from the House, such as the allowance of proposals to reduce the number of employees or cap their salaries. Unique points include the incremental narrowing of the rule's application over time and the potential for broader legislative provisions under the revised 115th Congress order, subject to the requirement of germaneness.

One such circumstance allows for the inclusion of legislative language in general appropriations bills or amendments thereto for \"germane provisions that retrench expenditures by the reduction of amounts of money covered by the bill.\" This exception appears in clause 2(b) of House Rule XXI and is known as the Holman rule, after Representative William Holman of Indiana, who first proposed the exception in 1876. Since the period immediately after its initial adoption, the House has interpreted the Holman rule through precedents that have tended to incrementally narrow its application. Under current precedents, for a legislative provision or amendment to be in order, the legislative language in question must be both germane to other provisions in the measure and must produce a clear reduction of appropriations in that bill. In addition, the House adopted a separate order during the 115th Congress that provided for retrenchments of expenditures by a reduction of amounts of money covered by the bill to be construed as applying to: any provision or amendment that retrenches expenditures by— (1) the reduction of amounts of money in the bill; (2) the reduction of the number and salary of the officers of the United States; or (3) the reduction of the compensation of any person paid out of the Treasury of the United States.

{"pred": " \n\nThe Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) aimed to focus federal agencies on performance by requiring them to set long-term and annual goals and measure progress towards those goals. While GPRA laid a solid foundation for results-oriented management, the use of performance information by managers to make decisions aimed at improving results did not fully realize its benefits. The Government Performance and Results Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA) expanded and enhanced the statutory framework for federal performance management, emphasizing the use of performance information for policy and program decisions. Despite these efforts, the use of performance information by mid- and upper-level managers within agencies has not improved significantly since 2013. Data-driven reviews, which are required by GPRAMA, have shown positive effects on progress toward agency goals and efforts to improve operational efficiency. However, the diffusion of these processes and practices to lower levels within agencies remains limited. The President's Management Agenda (PMA) and the Leveraging Data as a Strategic Asset CAP goal present opportunities to further enhance the use of performance information across the federal government. Recommendations include directing the leaders of the Leveraging Data as a Strategic Asset CAP Goal to ensure future updates to the action plan provide additional details on improving the use of data more extensively within federal agencies, and prioritizing efforts to identify and share among agencies proven practices for increasing and challenges that hamper the use of performance information in decision making more extensively within agencies. The report also highlights the importance of systematic efforts to address the challenges and promote the use of performance information at lower levels within agencies. Key evidence includes survey results showing little change in the use of performance information by managers since 2013, and the positive effects of data-driven reviews on performance improvement. Unique points include the emphasis on the need for a government-wide approach to enhance the use of performance information and the recommendation to prioritize efforts to share proven practices and address challenges at lower levels within agencies. The report also notes that while some agencies have shown improvements, the overall government-wide use of performance information has not improved since 2013. The findings suggest that more targeted efforts are needed to ensure the use of performance information is extended to lower levels within agencies.

The benefit of collecting performance information is only fully realized when it is used by managers to make decisions aimed at improving results. GAO was asked to review agencies' use of performance information. This report assesses, among other things, the extent to which: (1) 24 agencies' reported use of performance information and related leading practices has changed since 2013 and (2) the Executive Branch has taken actions to enhance the use of performance information. To address the first objective, GAO analyzed results from its 2017 survey of federal managers, and compared them to 2013 results. The survey covered a stratified random sample of 4,395 managers from the 24 Chief Financial Officers Act agencies. The survey had a 67 percent response rate and results can be generalized to the population of managers government-wide and at each agency. For the second objective, GAO reviewed agency documents and interviewed staff from OMB and the PIC. Agencies' reported use of performance information to make decisions, and leading practices that can promote such use, generally has not improved since GAO's last survey of federal managers in 2013. However, GAO's survey results continue to point to certain practices that could help agencies improve managers' use of performance information. For example, as shown in the table below, GAO's survey found that managers whose programs were subject to data-driven reviews (regular reviews used to assess progress on select agency goals) to a greater extent reported statistically significantly greater use of performance information to make decisions. The Executive Branch has begun taking steps to improve the use of performance information within agencies and across the government. For example, In the President's Management Agenda and government-wide reform plan, released in March and June 2018 respectively, the administration acknowledged the need to do more, and announced a goal, among other actions, to improve the use of data in federal decision making. However, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and others responsible for this goal have yet to fully develop action plans to hold agencies accountable for achieving it. The Performance Improvement Council (PIC), which is chaired by OMB, has undertaken efforts to improve the use of performance information by, for example, creating a working group on agency performance reviews. But it has not yet taken a systematic approach to identify and share proven practices that led to, or challenges that may be hampering, increased use of performance information by managers. GAO's survey results identified agencies that may have insights into such practices and challenges. More fully developing action plans for the new goal, and identifying and sharing proven practices and challenges, could help ensure the Executive Branch takes further steps to improve the use of performance information by managers within agencies and across the federal government. To improve the use of performance information within agencies and across the federal government, GAO recommends that OMB work with (1) fellow goal leaders to more fully develop action plans for the new goal to improve the use of data and (2) the PIC to prioritize efforts to identify and share proven practices and challenges.

This statement discusses Coast Guard actions needed to (1) improve the quality of data used for program management and (2) improve the transparency of its data for reporting on mission performance and planning. This statement is based on relevant products GAO issued from June 2014 through December 2017 on Coast Guard strategic planning and management issues, as well as related recommendation follow-up conducted through February 2018. GAO reviewed applicable laws, regulations, policies and guidance. GAO also interviewed Coast Guard officials responsible for administering these programs and obtained information on how they used data to inform decisionmaking. GAO interviewed a range of stakeholders, including federal and industry officials. GAO's prior work recommended multiple actions to improve the Coast Guard's program management by improving the quality of data it uses to manage and report on its mission performance. Specifically, GAO recommended actions such as collecting more complete data and clarifying the data limitations to facilitate more effective program management. For example, in December 2017, GAO found that more information is needed to calculate vessel safety statistics that could enhance the Coast Guard's knowledge about accident, injury, and fatality trends involving commercial fishing vessels. Having more complete information could be useful to carrying out its marine safety mission, and GAO recommended, among other things, that the Coast Guard ensure that data collected during commercial fishing vessel incident investigations is accurately captured. In 2018, the Coast Guard reported taking initial steps to capture more accurate data. GAO's prior work also identified areas where the Coast Guard could improve the transparency of the data it uses for reporting on its mission performance as well its capital planning purposes. For example, in an October 2017 report on performance goals, GAO found the Coast Guard's Annual Performance Report (APR) has not been released publicly since 2011. Consequently, there has not been full visibility over performance across all of the Coast Guard's missions. Coast Guard officials stated that a decision by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) leadership to limit the number of performance goals shared publicly had deterred the Coast Guard from public release of its APR. GAO recommended that APRs be available on the Coast Guard's website; the Coast Guard plans to publicly release future APRs.

Changes in the market for counterfeit goods entering the United States pose new challenges for consumers, the private sector, and U.S. agencies that enforce intellectual property rights (IPR). Specifically, growth in e-commerce has contributed to a shift in the sale of counterfeit goods in the United States, with consumers increasingly purchasing goods online and counterfeiters producing a wider variety of goods that may be sold on websites alongside authentic products. For example, 20 of 47 items GAO purchased from third-party sellers on popular consumer websites were counterfeit, according to testing by the products' rights holders (see table), highlighting potential risks to consumers. The changes in the market for counterfeit goods can also pose challenges to the private sector—for example, the challenge of distinguishing counterfeit from authentic goods listed for sale online—and complicate the enforcement efforts of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). CBP and ICE engage in a number of activities to enhance IPR enforcement; however, while ICE has assessed some of its efforts, CBP has taken limited steps to do so. CBP's and ICE's IPR enforcement activities broadly include detecting imports of potentially IPR-infringing goods, conducting special operations at U.S. ports, engaging with international partners, and undertaking localized pilot programs or port-led initiatives. CBP and ICE have collected some performance data for each of the eight activities GAO reviewed, and ICE has taken some steps to understand the impact of its efforts. However, CBP has conducted limited evaluation of its efforts to enhance IPR enforcement.

{"pred": " \n\nThe GAO report examines the documentation and timeliness of reviews of providers' clinical care at five VA medical centers from October 2013 to March 2017. Key findings include that almost half of the required reviews were not documented, and some reviews were delayed for up to multiple years. The report identifies two main issues: insufficient documentation requirements and inadequate oversight by VHA. Specifically, VHA policy does not mandate documentation for all types of reviews and lacks a timeliness requirement for initiating reviews. Additionally, VHA's networks do not routinely oversee the reviews, leading to gaps in documentation and delays. The report recommends that VHA require documentation of all reviews, establish timeliness requirements, and strengthen oversight by networks. The report also highlights that nine providers were not reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards despite significant clinical deficiencies, and that VHA's failure to report providers appropriately facilitates their continued practice at other facilities. The report recommends that VHA require networks to establish processes for overseeing timely reporting to the NPDB and state licensing boards. The findings underscore the importance of robust documentation and timely review processes to ensure patient safety and maintain accountability in healthcare delivery.

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (VAMC) officials are responsible for reviewing the clinical care delivered by their privileged providers—physicians and dentists who are approved to independently perform specific services—after concerns are raised. The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care. For example, GAO found that after one VAMC failed to report to the NPDB or SLBs a provider who resigned to avoid an adverse privileging action, a non-VA hospital in the same city took an adverse privileging action against that same provider for the same reason 2 years later."], "length": 13835}

{"pred": " \n\nPassage 2 discusses the effects of radiation exposure and the approach taken by federal agencies to regulate it. Higher radiation doses can cause immediate health effects, while lower doses are harder to detect. Federal agencies, such as the NRC, EPA, DOE, and FDA, rely on scientific advisory bodies to set radiation protection requirements and guidance, using the linear no-threshold model, which assumes a proportional relationship between radiation exposure and cancer risk. The National Academies' 2006 report supports this model, and agencies adhere to dose limits below the level considered low dose by the National Academies. The ALARA principle is applied to minimize radiation exposure. The document also mentions that federal agencies have funded research on the health effects of low-dose radiation, but funding has decreased over the past five years. Despite this, agencies have collaborated on specific projects but not on overall research priorities. The GAO recommends that the Secretary of Energy lead the development of a mechanism for interagency collaboration to address shared research priorities in low-dose radiation health effects, but DOE disagrees with this recommendation. Key evidence includes the use of the linear no-threshold model, dose limits set by federal agencies, and the decrease in funding for low-dose radiation research. Unique points include the reliance on scientific advisory bodies and the ALARA principle, as well as the recommendation for interagency collaboration despite DOE's disagreement. The summary highlights the regulatory framework and research efforts related to low-dose radiation exposure. Funding reductions and the lack of a collaborative mechanism for research priorities are also emphasized. The GAO's recommendation for interagency collaboration is a significant point, as it addresses the need for coordinated efforts in this field.

Funding reductions and the reliance on scientific advisory bodies are critical aspects highlighted", "answers": ["This testimony summarizes the information contained in GAO's September 2017 report, entitled Low-Dose Radiation: Interagency Collaboration on Planning Research Could Improve Information on Health Effects ( GAO-17-546 ). The Department of Energy (DOE), Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Food and Drug Administration generally used the advice of scientific advisory bodies to develop and apply radiation protection requirements and guidance for workers and the public in the radiation exposure settings that GAO reviewed. These settings were: (1) the operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants; (2) the cleanup of sites with radiological contamination; (3) the use of medical equipment that produces radiation; and (4) accidental or terrorism-related exposure to radiation. Specifically, the agencies relied on the advice of three scientific advisory bodies that supported the use of a model that assumes the risk of cancer increases with every incremental radiation exposure. Accordingly, the agencies have set regulatory dose limits and issued guidance to confine exposure to levels that reduce the risk of cancer, while recognizing that scientific uncertainties occur in estimating cancer risks from low-dose radiation. For example, NRC requires nuclear power plants to consider measures for limiting workers' exposure below NRC's regulatory dose limit, such as by using robots for maintenance work in radiation areas. GAO identified seven federal agencies that funded research on low-dose radiation's health effects. In fiscal years 2012 to 2016, DOE, NRC, EPA, and four other federal agencies obligated about $210 million for such research . Although the agencies have collaborated on individual projects on radiation's health effects, they have not established a collaborative mechanism to set research priorities. GAO's previous work has shown that federal agencies can use such mechanisms to implement interagency collaboration to develop and coordinate sound science policies. In the past, DOE took a leading role in this area because DOE provided stable funding and advocated for greater coordination on research on low-dose radiation's health effects. However, since fiscal year 2012, DOE has phased out funding for one of its main research programs in this area. This has created a void in coordination efforts among federal agencies, and no other agency has stepped forward to fill this void. Because of DOE's prior experience as a leader in this area of research and its research responsibility under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, it could play an important role in helping federal agencies establish a coordinating mechanism for low-dose radiation research.

It begins with the early use of emergency powers by the Continental Congress and the Constitutional Convention, noting that the exercise of such powers was largely ad hoc and informal until the 20th century. The passage highlights the significant expansion of emergency powers during World War I and the subsequent establishment of the National Emergencies Act in 1976, which aimed to regulate and limit the use of emergency powers. Key evidence includes the identification of 470 provisions of federal law that delegate extraordinary authority to the executive in times of national emergency, and the historical context of emergency powers, such as President Lincoln's use of emergency powers during the Civil War. The passage concludes by noting that while the National Emergencies Act has been effective in regulating emergency powers, it has not been revisited by congressional overseers since its enactment. Additionally, the passage mentions an anomaly in the activation of emergency powers during the response to Hurricane Katrina, where the President bypassed the usual procedure of declaring a national emergency to activate certain authorities. The unique point made is the shift from ad hoc emergency powers to more formalized statutory delegations, and the ongoing tension between the executive and legislative branches over the scope and regulation of emergency powers. The summary ends by mentioning the current state of emergency powers and the potential for further reforms in the future.

Both the judiciary and Congress, as co-equal branches, can restrain the executive regarding emergency powers. So can public opinion. Since 1976, the President has been subject to certain procedural formalities in utilizing some statutorily delegated emergency authority. The National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. §§1601-1651) eliminated or modified some statutory grants of emergency authority, required the President to formally declare the existence of a national emergency and to specify what statutory authority activated by the declaration would be used, and provided Congress a means to countermand the President's declaration and the activated authority being sought.

The majority of this funding supports projects related to economic growth, infrastructure, health, education, and governance. Payments to Palestinian Authority (PA) creditors, including two Israeli fuel companies and a local Palestinian bank, account for a significant portion of the ESF assistance. USAID ensures that these payments do not support entities or individuals associated with terrorism by vetting each PA creditor annually. USAID also conducts external assessments of the PA's financial systems to ensure accountability and compliance with legislative requirements. Despite some weaknesses identified in the PA's financial systems, USAID concludes that the vetting process and additional mitigation steps minimize the risk of misuse of funds. The report highlights the importance of maintaining transparency and accountability in the use of US aid to the Palestinians. Key evidence includes detailed financial data on obligations and expenditures, as well as assessments and audits of the PA's financial systems. Unique points include the rationale for direct payments to creditors and the ongoing efforts to ensure compliance with legal and policy requirements. The report also notes that USAID does not plan to resume direct payments to the PA, preferring to make payments to creditors to enhance transparency and minimize the risk of misappropriation. The findings suggest that while challenges exist, USAID's approach to managing these funds is generally effective in achieving its goals.

According to the Department of State, this assistance to the Palestinians promotes U.S. economic and political foreign policy interests by supporting Middle East peace negotiations and financing economic stabilization programs. USAID is primarily responsible for administering ESF assistance to the West Bank and Gaza. Appropriations acts for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 included provisions for GAO to review the treatment, handling, and uses of funds provided through the ESF for assistance to the West Bank and Gaza. This report examines (1) the status of ESF assistance and projects provided to the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016, including project assistance and payments to PA creditors, and (2) the extent to which USAID conducted required vetting of PA creditors to ensure that this assistance would not support entities or individuals associated with terrorism and assessed PA ministries' capacity to use ESF assistance as intended. GAO reviewed relevant laws and regulations and USAID financial data, policies, procedures, and documents. GAO also interviewed USAID and State Department officials. As of March 2018, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) had allocated about $545 million of funding appropriated to the Economic Support Fund (ESF) for assistance in the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016. USAID obligated about $544 million (over 99 percent) and expended about $351 million (over 64 percent) of the total allocations. Project assistance accounted for approximately $399 million of the obligated funds, while payments to Palestinian Authority (PA) creditors accounted for $145 million (see figure). USAID's obligations for project assistance in the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 supported three development objectives—Economic Growth and Infrastructure ($239 million), Investing in the Next Generation ($107 million), and Governance and Civic Engagement (about $25 million). In fiscal years 2015 and 2016, USAID made payments directly to PA creditors—two Israeli fuel companies, to cover debts for petroleum purchases, and a local Palestinian bank, to pay off a line of credit used for PA medical referrals to six hospitals in the East Jerusalem Hospital network. USAID vetted PA creditors to ensure that the program assistance would not provide support to entities or individuals associated with terrorism and also conducted external assessments and financial audits of PA ministries of Health and Finance and Planning. USAID documentation showed that, as required, officials checked the vetting status of each PA creditor within 12 months before USAID signed its debt relief grant agreements with the PA. In addition, although USAID determined that it was not legally required to assess the PA Ministry of Health's medical referral services and the Ministry of Finance and Planning's petroleum procurement system, the agency commissioned external assessments of both ministries. These assessments found some weaknesses in both ministries' systems; however, USAID mission officials stated that these weaknesses did not affect USAID debt relief payments to the PA creditors. Nevertheless, USAID took additional steps to mitigate the identified weaknesses. For example, a USAID contractor worked with the Ministry of Health to update, revise, and approve guidelines for medical referrals. In addition, USAID commissioned financial audits of the debt relief grant agreements between USAID and the PA for direct payments to PA creditors in fiscal year 2015 and 2016.

The passage mentions that VA has 430 vacant or mostly vacant buildings averaging over 60 years old, and 784 underutilized buildings. Additionally, VA faces challenges in engaging stakeholders effectively, which can lead to adversarial relationships and hinder facility alignment efforts. The passage also examines the limitations of VA's Strategic Capital Investment Planning (SCIP) and VA Integrated Planning (VAIP) processes, noting that SCIP's subjective narratives, long timeframes, and restricted access to information undermine its effectiveness. VAIP's facility master plans assume all future growth in services will be provided directly through VA facilities, which is inaccurate given VA's use of non-VA providers. The passage concludes by suggesting that Congress should consider DOD's BRAC process as a model for VA's asset and infrastructure review, emphasizing the need for clear goals, criteria, cost estimates, and stakeholder involvement. Key evidence includes the number of vacant and underutilized buildings, the limitations of VA's planning processes, and the importance of stakeholder engagement. Unique points include the discontinuation of VAIP's facility master plans and the need for a national realignment strategy.

DOD has repeatedly applied the BRAC process to reduce the amount of unneeded property that it owns and leases and to save billions of dollars that could be applied to higher priority defense needs. This statement is based on GAO's April 2017 report related to VA facility alignment ( GAO-17-349 ) and numerous GAO reports related to the BRAC process as summarized in a June 2011 testimony ( GAO-11-704T ) and a March 2012 testimony ( GAO-12-513T ). This statement addresses (1) the factors that affect VA's facility alignment and the extent to which VA's capital-planning process facilitates the alignment of facilities with the veterans' population, and (2) the key elements and challenges affecting DOD and the Commission in BRAC 2005. Detailed information on our scope and methodologies for this work can be found in these published products, cited throughout this testimony. Geographic shifts in the veterans' population, changes in health care delivery, aging infrastructure, and limited stakeholder involvement affect the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) efforts to align its services and real property portfolio to meet the needs of veterans. For example, a shift over time from inpatient to outpatient care will likely result in underutilized space once used for inpatient care. Further, the historic status of some VA facilities adds to the complexity of converting or disposing of them. In such instances, it is often difficult and costly for VA to modernize, renovate, and retrofit these older facilities. GAO reported that two of the planning processes VA uses to align its facilities—VA's Strategic Capital Investment Planning (SCIP) and the VA Integrated Planning (VAIP)—have limitations that undermine VA's efforts to achieve its goals. Specifically: VA relies on the SCIP process to plan and prioritize capital projects, but VA routinely asks its facility planners to submit their next year's planned project narratives before knowing if their previous submissions have been funded. The overlapping budget cycle, which is outside of VA's control, combined with other SCIP limitations—including subjective narratives, long time frames, and restricted access to information—make it difficult for VA to rely on SCIP to accurately identify the capital necessary to address its service and infrastructure gaps. VA concurred that it needs to address SCIP limitations that are within its control, as GAO recommended; VA has made some progress in implementing the recommendation has made some progress in implementing the recommendation.\\ The VAIP process is estimated to cost $108 million and to produce market-level service delivery plans and facility master plans. However, the VAIP master plans incorrectly assume that all future growth in services will be provided directly through VA facilities without considering alternatives, such as purchasing care from the community. GAO recommended that VA consider discontinuing the VAIP facility master plans pending an assessment of their value as a facility-planning tool. VA agreed with the recommendation and is implementing it while pursuing a national realignment strategy.. Key elements of the Department of Defense's (DOD) 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process could benefit VA's asset and infrastructure review. The key elements included: (1) establishing goals for the process, (2) developing criteria for evaluating closures and realignments, and (3) establishing an organizational structure to develop closure and realignment options. GAO identified key challenges that affected DOD's implementation of BRAC 2005 and the results achieved; these challenges would need to be addressed if VA is to successfully apply the process. These challenges included: (1) large, complex recommendations required sustained senior leadership's attention and a high level of coordination among many stakeholders, and (2) the large number of actions that depend on each other for successful implementation.

Key points include:\n\n1. **Federal Role**: Federal laws like HAVA and NVRA require states to establish uniform standards and implement specific election administration policies, but the actual implementation is largely handled by localities. States and localities have varying levels of autonomy in decision-making and funding.\n\n2. **Policymaking**: States and localities have different methods for making election administration decisions, ranging from state legislatures and governors to voter initiatives and referendums. This variability affects how federal mandates are interpreted and implemented.\n\n3. **Implementation**: Most election administration duties are carried out by local officials, leading to inconsistencies across jurisdictions. Federal funding, such as HAVA, is often claimed and used by state officials, potentially delaying access for localities.\n\n4. **Structural Variations**: Election systems vary by leadership structure, relationship with the state, and population size. These differences can impact the effectiveness of federal mandates and funding.\n\n5. **Impact of Federal Actions**: Past federal laws and regulations have both intentionally and unintentionally altered state and local election systems, highlighting the importance of considering these systems when designing new policies.\n\n6. **Considerations for Congress**: When considering changes to election administration, Congress should account for the decentralized nature of these systems, ensuring that proposed changes are adaptable to local contexts and do not inadvertently alter existing structures. The choice of policy tools (requirements vs. funding) should be tailored to the specific goals and the nature of the state and local systems. **Key Evidence**: Data on state contributions to election costs, examples of cost-sharing arrangements, and descriptions of different leadership structures and funding mechanisms illustrate the complexity of the decentralized system. **Unique Points**: The passage emphasizes the importance of understanding the decentralized nature of election administration and the potential unintended consequences of federal interventions.

Elections are primarily administered by thousands of state and local systems rather than a single, unified national system. States and localities share responsibility for most election administration duties. Exactly how responsibilities are assigned at the state and local levels varies both between and within states, but there are some general patterns in the distribution of duties. States typically have primary responsibility for making decisions about the rules of elections (policymaking). Localities typically have primary responsibility for conducting elections in accordance with those rules (implementation). Localities, with varying contributions from states, typically also have primary responsibility for paying for the activities and resources required to conduct elections (funding). The structures of the state and local systems that conduct elections also vary between and within states. Common variations include differences related to the leadership of the system, the relationship between local election officials and the state, and the population size and density of the jurisdiction the system serves. The leadership of a state or local election system may be elected or appointed, and both the leaders and the methods used to select them may be partisan, bipartisan, or nonpartisan. State officials may have more or less direct influence over local election officials, and the extent of their influence may be affected by other structural features of the state's election systems, such as the methods used to select local officials. Finally, larger election jurisdictions have different administrative advantages and challenges than smaller ones, and more urban jurisdictions have different advantages and challenges than more rural ones. These differences between jurisdictions may be reflected in structural features of the election systems that serve them, such as how the systems allocate resources and where they find specialized expertise. Understanding the duties and structures of state and local election systems may be relevant to Congress for at least two reasons. First, the way state and local election systems work can affect how well federal action on election administration serves its intended purposes. The effectiveness of federal action depends in part on how it is implemented. How it is implemented can depend, in turn, on how the state and local election systems that implement it work. Second, Congress can make or incentivize changes to the way state and local election systems work. Congress has a number of policy tools it can use to affect the administration of federal elections.

WMATA initiated a new preventive maintenance program for its rail track in 2017, and is currently implementing a new capital planning process. GAO was asked to examine issues related to WMATA's capital funding and maintenance practices. This report examines: (1) how WMATA spent its capital funds from fiscal years 2011 through 2017, (2) how WMATA's new capital planning process addresses weaknesses it identified in the prior process, and (3) WMATA's progress toward its track preventive maintenance program's goals and how the program aligns with leading program management practices. GAO analyzed WMATA's financial and program information, interviewed officials of WMATA, the Federal Transit Administration, and five transit agencies selected for similarities to WMATA. GAO compared WMATA's capital planning process and track maintenance program with leading practices. From fiscal years 2011 through 2017, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) spent almost $6 billion on a variety of capital assets, with the largest share spent on improving its rail and bus fleet (see figure). Over this period, WMATA's capital spending was, on average, about $845 million annually. WMATA's new capital planning process could address some weaknesses it identified in the prior process. WMATA established a framework for quantitatively prioritizing capital needs (investments to a group of related assets) over a 10-year period. However, WMATA has not established documented policies and procedures for implementing the new process, such as those for selecting specific projects for funding in its annual capital budget. WMATA is currently using its new capital planning process to make fiscal year 2020 investment decisions. WMATA has proposed a fiscal year 2020 capital budget of $1.4 billion. Without documented policies and procedures for implementing the new planning process, WMATA's stakeholders do not have reasonable assurance that WMATA is following a sound process for making investment decisions. WMATA has made significant progress toward its track preventive maintenance program's goals, which are to reduce both track-defect and electrical-fire incidents by 50 percent in fiscal year 2019 compared with 2017. In fiscal year 2018, WMATA met its goal for reducing track defect incidents and reduced electrical fire incidents by 20 percent. However, in designing the program, WMATA did not fully assess risks. For example, WMATA did not quantitatively assess the impact of track defects or electrical fires on its ability to provide service, nor did it consider other risks such as non-electrical track fires, which represent about 30 percent of all fires on the system, or other factors, such as resources or track time. Without a comprehensive risk assessment, WMATA lacks reasonable assurance that the program is designed to address risks affecting the safety of the rail system or other risks that could hinder the new program's success. GAO is making five recommendations, including that WMATA establish documented policies and procedures for the new capital planning process and conduct a comprehensive risk assessment for the track preventive maintenance program.

{"pred": " \n\nThe rise of e-commerce has significantly impacted the market for counterfeit goods, shifting sales from underground markets to primary markets like e-commerce websites and traditional retail stores. This shift has enabled counterfeiters to adopt new deceptive tactics, such as exploiting third-party marketplaces and setting prices close to authentic goods. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have observed a 38% increase in Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) seizures from 2012 to 2016, with China and Hong Kong being the primary sources of counterfeit goods. The variety of products being counterfeited has expanded, and the methods of importation have shifted towards smaller express shipments. While rights holders and e-commerce websites have taken steps to combat counterfeiting, challenges remain, including the difficulty in distinguishing between legitimate and counterfeit goods and the need for more comprehensive information sharing between law enforcement and the private sector. CBP and ICE have engaged in various activities to enhance IPR enforcement, but limited evaluation of these efforts has been conducted, highlighting the need for more systematic assessment to ensure resource efficiency. The passage emphasizes the evolving nature of the counterfeit goods market and the ongoing challenges faced by law enforcement and the private sector in addressing this issue. Key evidence includes CBP seizure data and officials' observations, as well as examples of deceptive tactics employed by counterfeiters. Innovative points include the shift towards smaller express shipments and the need for improved information sharing between CBP, ICE, and the private sector. The changing marketplace also presents challenges to the private sector, such as the difficulty in identifying and investigating individual counterfeit cases and tracking goods from known counterfeiters through various website fulfillment and delivery mechanisms.

Changes in the market for counterfeit goods entering the United States pose new challenges for consumers, the private sector, and U.S. agencies that enforce intellectual property rights (IPR). Specifically, growth in e-commerce has contributed to a shift in the sale of counterfeit goods in the United States, with consumers increasingly purchasing goods online and counterfeiters producing a wider variety of goods that may be sold on websites alongside authentic products. For example, 20 of 47 items GAO purchased from third-party sellers on popular consumer websites were counterfeit, according to testing by the products' rights holders (see table), highlighting potential risks to consumers. The changes in the market for counterfeit goods can also pose challenges to the private sector—for example, the challenge of distinguishing counterfeit from authentic goods listed for sale online—and complicate the enforcement efforts of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). CBP and ICE engage in a number of activities to enhance IPR enforcement; however, while ICE has assessed some of its efforts, CBP has taken limited steps to do so. CBP's and ICE's IPR enforcement activities broadly include detecting imports of potentially IPR-infringing goods, conducting special operations at U.S. ports, engaging with international partners, and undertaking localized pilot programs or port-led initiatives. CBP and ICE have collected some performance data for each of the eight activities GAO reviewed, and ICE has taken some steps to understand the impact of its efforts. However, CBP has conducted limited evaluation of its efforts to enhance IPR enforcement. Consequently, CBP may lack information needed to ensure it is investing its resources in the most efficient and effective activities. CBP and ICE generally collaborate on IPR enforcement, but according to private sector representatives, restrictions on CBP's information sharing limit private sector enforcement efforts. GAO found that CBP and ICE have undertaken efforts that align with selected key practices for interagency collaboration, such as participating in developing a national IPR enforcement strategy and agreeing on roles and responsibilities. However, sharing additional information about seized items with rights-holding companies and e-commerce websites could improve enforcement, according to private sector representatives. CBP officials said they share information to the extent allowed under current regulations, but CBP has not completed an assessment of what, if any, additional information would be beneficial to share with private sector entities.

{"pred": " \n\nThe GAO report highlights significant issues with the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) regarding the documentation and timeliness of reviews of providers' clinical care and the reporting of providers to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) and state licensing boards. From October 2013 to March 2017, five VA medical centers reviewed 148 providers but could not document that almost half of these reviews were conducted. Additionally, the VA medical centers did not always initiate reviews promptly, with some taking up to multiple years to begin. The report attributes these issues to a lack of VHA policy requiring documentation of all reviews and inadequate oversight by VHA networks. To address these shortcomings, the GAO recommends that VHA require documentation of all reviews, establish timeliness requirements, and strengthen oversight by networks. Regarding provider reporting, the VA medical centers reported only one of nine providers required to be reported to the NPDB, and the reporting process was often delayed or mishandled due to misunderstandings of VHA policies and insufficient network oversight. The report concludes that VHA's failure to report providers appropriately facilitates substandard care providers obtaining privileges at other VA medical centers or outside hospitals, leading to potential harm to veterans. The GAO recommends that VHA require networks to establish processes for timely reporting to the NPDB and state licensing boards. The report underscores the importance of robust documentation and timely reporting to ensure patient safety and maintain high standards of care in VA medical facilities. Key evidence includes the documented cases of providers not being reviewed or reported as required, and the delays in reporting to state licensing boards.

The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care. For example, GAO found that after one VAMC failed to report to the NPDB or SLBs a provider who resigned to avoid an adverse privileging action, a non-VA hospital in the same city took an adverse privileging action against that same provider for the same reason 2 years later."], "length": 13946}
{"pred": " \n\nPassage 1 discusses the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), an agency of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) that insures private mortgage lenders against borrower default. Established during the Great Depression, FHA aims to facilitate access to affordable mortgages for certain households and plays a countercyclical role in the mortgage market. Key features of FHA-insured mortgages include lower down payment requirements, less stringent credit history requirements, and eligibility for first-time homebuyers, low- and moderate-income households, and minorities. FHA-insured loans have specific underwriting criteria, including credit score requirements and debt-to-income ratios. The report also covers the financial aspects of FHA, such as mortgage insurance premiums, the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund, and the capital ratio requirement. Additionally, it provides data on the number and dollar volume of FHA-insured mortgages, as well as FHA's market share in recent years.

FHA insures private lenders against the possibility of borrowers defaulting on mortgages that meet certain criteria, thereby expanding the availability of mortgage credit beyond what may be available otherwise. If the borrower defaults on the mortgage, FHA is to repay the lender the remaining amount owed. A household that obtains an FHA-insured mortgage must meet FHA's eligibility and underwriting standards, including showing that it has sufficient income to repay a mortgage. FHA requires a minimum down payment of 3.5% from most borrowers, which is lower than the down payment required for many other types of mortgages. FHA-insured mortgages cannot exceed a statutory maximum mortgage amount, which varies by area and is based on area median house prices but cannot exceed a specified ceiling in high-cost areas. (The ceiling is set at $726,525 in high-cost areas in calendar year 2019.) Borrowers are charged fees, called mortgage insurance premiums, in exchange for the insurance. In FY2018, FHA insured over 1 million new mortgages (including both home purchase and refinance mortgages) with a combined principal balance of $209 billion. FHA's share of the mortgage market tends to vary with economic conditions and other factors. In the aftermath of the housing market turmoil that began around 2007 and a related contraction of mortgage lending, FHA insured a larger share of mortgages than it had in the preceding years.

{"pred": " \nThe Coast Guard's Transition Assistance Program (TAP) faces challenges in ensuring all eligible servicemembers participate in the program. Key issues include unreliable data collection, lack of clear roles and responsibilities for TAP implementation, and insufficient monitoring of TAP participation. The program lacks a current Commandant Instruction defining these roles and responsibilities, and data collection methods are inconsistent, leading to incomplete and delayed data. This hinders the Coast Guard's ability to track and improve TAP participation rates. Additionally, the program does not have formal performance goals or monitor the timeliness of TAP participation or access to additional 2-day classes. The Coast Guard is planning to adopt DOD's TAP-IT Enterprise System to improve data reliability and sharing, but this will take time. The report recommends issuing an updated Commandant Instruction, establishing performance goals, and enhancing monitoring efforts to better prepare Coast Guard servicemembers for civilian life. The main argument is that the Coast Guard needs to improve its TAP implementation to ensure all eligible servicemembers receive the necessary support for a smooth transition. Key evidence includes the lack of a current Commandant Instruction, inconsistent data collection, and the absence of formal performance goals. Unique points include the reliance on online TAP classes for remote and rapidly separating servicemembers, and the Coast Guard's plan to adopt DOD's TAP-IT Enterprise System.

To help them prepare, federal law mandated that DHS provide separating Coast Guard servicemembers with counseling, employment assistance, and information on veterans' benefits through TAP. GAO was asked to examine TAP implementation. This review analyzes (1) the reliability of TAP data on participation levels for Coast Guard servicemembers and the factors that affect participation, and (2) the Coast Guard's performance measures and monitoring efforts related to TAP. GAO interviewed Coast Guard headquarters staff; surveyed 12 Coast Guard installations that conduct TAP (100 percent response rate); collected and reviewed participation data for reliability; and interviewed TAP managers from three installations selected for size and location, and 25 Coast Guard servicemembers at one location. (For a companion report on TAP implementation for separating and retiring servicemembers in other military services, see GAO-18-23 .) The United States Coast Guard (Coast Guard), which is overseen by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), lacks complete or reliable data on participation in the Transition Assistance Program (TAP), designed to assist servicemembers returning to civilian life. According to senior Coast Guard officials, a major reason why data are not reliable is the lack of an up-to-date Commandant Instruction that specifies when to record TAP participation data. Consequently, the data are updated on an ad-hoc basis and may not be timely or complete, according to officials. Federal internal control standards call for management to use quality information to achieve the entity's objectives. Until the Coast Guard issues an up-to-date Commandant Instruction that establishes policies and procedures to improve the reliability and completeness of TAP data, it will lack quality information to gauge the extent to which it is meeting TAP participation requirements in the VOW to Hire Heroes Act of 2011. According to GAO's survey of Coast Guard installations, various factors affected participation, such as servicemembers serving at geographically remote locations or separating from the Coast Guard rapidly. TAP officials and Coast Guard servicemembers GAO interviewed said commanders and direct supervisors sometimes pulled servicemembers out of TAP class or postponed participation because of mission priorities. TAP managers also said they rely on delivering TAP online because many Coast Guard servicemembers are stationed remotely. The Coast Guard cannot effectively measure performance to ensure key TAP requirements are met because it lacks reliable data and does not monitor compliance with several TAP requirements. Further, the Coast Guard has not established a formal performance goal against which it can measure progress, although federal internal control standards stipulate that management should consider external requirements—such as the laws with which the entity is required to comply—to clearly define objectives in specific and measurable terms. Establishing a goal could help the Coast Guard define expected performance. In addition, the Coast Guard does not monitor TAP requirements regarding the timeliness of servicemembers' TAP participation or their access to additional 2-day classes. Consequently, it cannot know whether servicemembers are starting TAP early enough to complete the program or those who elected to attend additional 2-day classes were able to do so before separation or retirement, as required by the Act. Finally, the Coast Guard lacks an up-to-date Commandant Instruction that establishes the roles and responsibilities of Coast Guard staff in implementing TAP. Federal internal control standards stipulate that management should assign responsibility and delegate authority to key roles throughout the entity. Issuing an up-to-date Commandant Instruction that defines roles and responsibilities would clarify who is ultimately responsible for ensuring Coast Guard servicemembers attend TAP, thereby facilitating accountability. GAO is making seven recommendations, including that the Coast Guard issue a new Commandant Instruction establishing data collection policies, set TAP performance goals, monitor timeliness and access, and define roles and responsibilities.

{"pred": " \n\nThe passage provides an extensive overview of the U.S. Navy's ship-naming process, tracing its evolution from the 19th century to contemporary practices. Key points include:\n\n1. The Secretary of the Navy traditionally has the authority to name new ships, although the exact legal basis has shifted over time. Current practices involve a complex process involving research, recommendations from various sources, and ultimately the Secretary's decision.\n\n2. Ship names are chosen based on a mix of historical, geographical, and personal criteria. For example, states, cities, battles, and naval heroes are common sources. Exceptions to standard naming conventions are made for significant figures like presidents and members of Congress.\n\n3. The process of naming ships has evolved over time, adapting to changes in naval technology and priorities. For instance, the naming of submarines has shifted from fish to states.\n\n4. The Navy has faced challenges in maintaining a steady supply of names for certain ship types, particularly for Virginia-class submarines and aircraft carriers. This has led to debates about whether to amend naming rules or make exceptions.\n\n5. The passage notes that naming ships for living individuals has become more common in recent decades, reflecting a return to practices from the early days of the U.S. Navy.\n\n6. The report concludes that current naming practices align with historical traditions and are effective, arguing against the establishment of rigid, fixed policies for ship naming. Instead, it recommends continued flexibility to address evolving needs and priorities. The Navy plans to publish updated guidelines to enhance transparency and understanding of the naming process. The report also highlights the importance of balancing historical continuity with the need to honor contemporary heroes and contributions. The evolving nature of ship naming reflects the dynamic character of the U.S. Navy and its changing missions and technologies over time. The passage underscores the complexity and significance of the ship-naming process, which involves a blend of tradition, practical considerations, and political influence. Key evidence includes historical examples, current practices, and the Navy's own analysis of the naming process. The report's recommendation against fixed policies reflects a nuanced understanding of the challenges and opportunities in maintaining a flexible yet coherent naming system. The inclusion of transparency measures, such as publishing updated naming guidelines, aims to foster greater public understanding and engagement with this important aspect of naval heritage.

The passage emphasizes the importance of balancing historical continuity with the need to honor contemporary figures and contributions", "answers": ["Names for Navy ships traditionally have been chosen and announced by the Secretary of the Navy, under the direction of the President and in accordance with rules prescribed by Congress. Rules for giving certain types of names to certain types of Navy ships have evolved over time. There have been exceptions to the Navy's ship-naming rules, particularly for the purpose of naming a ship for a person when the rule for that type of ship would have called for it to be named for something else. Some observers have perceived a breakdown in, or corruption of, the rules for naming Navy ships. On July 13, 2012, the Navy submitted to Congress a 73-page report on the Navy's policies and practices for naming ships. For ship types now being procured for the Navy, or recently procured for the Navy, naming rules can be summarized as follows: The first Ohio replacement ballistic missile submarine (SSBN-826) has been named Columbia in honor of the District of Columbia, but the Navy has not stated what the naming rule for these ships will be. Virginia (SSN-774) class attack submarines are being named for states. Aircraft carriers are generally named for past U.S. Presidents. Of the past 14, 10 were named for past U.S. Presidents, and 2 for Members of Congress. Destroyers are being named for deceased members of the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, including Secretaries of the Navy. The Navy has not yet announced a naming rule for its planned new class of FFG(X) frigates, the first of which the Navy wants to procure in FY2021. Previous classes of U.S. Navy frigates, like Navy destroyers, were generally named for naval leaders and heroes. Littoral Combat Ships (LCSs) are being named for regionally important U.S. cities and communities. Amphibious assault ships are being named for important battles in which U.S. Marines played a prominent part, and for famous earlier U.S. Navy ships that were not named for battles. San Antonio (LPD-17) class amphibious ships are being named for major U.S. cities and communities, and cities and communities attacked on September 11, 2001. John Lewis (TAO-205) class oilers are being named for people who fought for civil rights and human rights. Expeditionary Fast Transports (EPFs) are being named for small U.S. cities. Expeditionary Transport Docks (ESDs) and Expeditionary Sea Bases (ESBs) are being named for famous names or places of historical significance to U.S. Marines. Navajo (TATS-6) class towing, salvage, and rescue ships are being named for prominent Native Americans or Native American tribes. Since 1974, at least 21 U.S. military ships have been named for persons who were living at the time the name was announced. The most recent instance occurred on May 6, 2019, when the Navy announced that it was naming the destroyer DDG-51 for former Senator Sam Nunn. Members of the public are sometimes interested in having Navy ships named for their own states or cities, for older U.S. Navy ships (particularly those on which they or their relatives served), for battles in which they or their relatives participated, or for people they admire. Congress has long maintained an interest in how Navy ships are named, and has influenced the naming of certain Navy ships. The Navy suggests that congressional offices wishing to express support for proposals to name a Navy ship for a specific person, place, or thing contact the office of the Secretary of the Navy to make their support known. Congress may also pass legislation relating to ship names. Measures passed by Congress in recent years regarding Navy ship names have all been sense-of-the-Congress provisions."], "length": 14144}

Since the 9/11 attacks, foreign aid has been increasingly linked to counterterrorism and stabilization efforts in regions like Afghanistan and Iraq. The U.S. foreign aid program is multifaceted, involving various agencies and types of assistance, such as military aid, development assistance, and humanitarian aid. Key data show that in FY2017, approximately 33% of total aid was bilateral development assistance, 10% was economic support funds, and 29% was military assistance. The passage highlights the complexity of aid delivery, noting that while USAID implements the majority of bilateral economic and humanitarian aid, other agencies like the Department of Defense and State Department also play significant roles. Additionally, the report underscores the shift towards non-traditional aid, particularly in Iraq and Afghanistan, where military and development assistance were closely intertwined. The text also notes that the majority of U.S. aid is now provided as grants rather than loans, and that the use of the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) designation has allowed for increased funding without hitting budget caps. Lastly, the passage provides context on the global landscape of foreign aid, noting that while the U.S. remains the largest donor, it lags behind in terms of aid as a percentage of GDP compared to other countries. The report concludes by summarizing the various ways in which foreign aid is categorized and implemented, highlighting the evolving nature of U.S. foreign assistance policies and programs. The data presented in the report are the most current, consistent, and reliable figures available, generally updated through FY2017. The passage emphasizes the importance of understanding the full scope of U.S. foreign aid, including both traditional and non-traditional forms, to grasp the extent of its evolution over time.

On the basis of national security, commercial, and humanitarian rationales, U.S. assistance flows through many federal agencies and supports myriad objectives. These include promoting economic growth, reducing poverty, improving governance, expanding access to health care and education, promoting stability in conflict regions, countering terrorism, promoting human rights, strengthening allies, and curbing illicit drug production and trafficking. Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, foreign aid has increasingly been associated with national security policy. At the same time, many Americans and some Members of Congress view foreign aid as an expense that the United States cannot afford given current budget deficits. In FY2017, U.S. foreign assistance, defined broadly, totaled an estimated $49.87 billion, or 1.2% of total federal budget authority. About 44% of this assistance was for bilateral economic development programs, including political/strategic economic assistance; 35% for military aid and nonmilitary security assistance; 18% for humanitarian activities; and 4% to support the work of multilateral institutions. Assistance can take the form of cash transfers, equipment and commodities, infrastructure, or technical assistance, and, in recent decades, is provided almost exclusively on a grant rather than loan basis. Most U.S. aid is implemented by nongovernmental organizations rather than foreign governments. The United States is the largest foreign aid donor in the world, accounting for about 24% of total official development assistance from major donor governments in 2017 (the latest year for which these data are available). Key foreign assistance trends in the past decade include growth in development aid, particularly global health programs; increased security assistance directed toward U.S. allies in the anti-terrorism effort; and high levels of humanitarian assistance to address a range of crises. Adjusted for inflation, annual foreign assistance funding over the past decade was the highest it has been since the Marshall Plan in the years immediately following World War II. In FY2017, Afghanistan, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, and Egypt received the largest amounts of U.S. aid, reflecting long-standing aid commitments to Israel and Egypt, the strategic significance of Afghanistan and Iraq, and the strategic and humanitarian importance of Jordan as the crisis in neighboring Syria continues. The Near East region received 27% of aid allocated by country or region in FY2017, followed by Africa, at 25%, and South and Central Asia, at 15%. This was a significant shift from a decade prior, when Africa received 19% of aid and the Near East 34%, reflecting significant increases in HIV/AIDS-related programs concentrated in Africa between FY2007 and FY2017 and the drawdown of U.S. military forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Recent studies suggest that these behaviors are part of a “continuum of harm,” which DOD defines as a range of interconnected, inappropriate behaviors that are connected to the occurrence of sexual assault and that support an environment that tolerates these behaviors. Senate Report 114-255 included a provision for GAO to review efforts by DOD to prevent unwanted sexual behaviors in the military. GAO assessed the extent to which DOD has (1) policies on sexual harassment that include CDC principles and relevant legislative elements; (2) processes for maintaining and reporting consistent data on incidents of unwanted sexual behaviors; and (3) overarching efforts, including a prevention strategy, to address unwanted sexual behaviors across the continuum of harm. GAO reviewed DOD policies and pertinent databases, and interviewed agency officials. The Department of Defense's (DOD) policies on sexual harassment include some but not all of the Centers for Disease Control's (CDC) principles for preventing sexual violence and include most relevant legislative elements. GAO identified six principles from CDC's framework for preventing sexual violence, which CDC defines as including sexual harassment. GAO found that Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and military service policies generally include CDC's principles regarding prevention strategies, but none address risk and protective factors, which identify conditions or behaviors that might heighten or lower the risk of sexual harassment victimization or perpetration, respectively. Additionally, a statutory provision in fiscal year 2013 mandated that DOD, among other things, develop a comprehensive sexual harassment policy that includes prevention training, mechanisms for anonymous reporting, and mechanisms for resolving incidents of sexual harassment. OSD and service policies are generally consistent with those required elements except for the inclusion of anonymous reporting. DOD is developing a new department-wide policy that will address sexual harassment, but it is too early to determine how the policy will address these issues. Without policies that include CDC's principles and mechanisms for anonymous reporting, DOD may miss opportunities to address and potentially reduce incidents of unwanted sexual behaviors. Finally, a statutory change in fiscal year 2017 redefined sexual harassment for certain purposes so it is no longer defined solely as a form of sex discrimination but is recognized also as an adverse behavior on the spectrum of behavior that can contribute to an increase in the incidence of sexual assault. While officials indicated a need to update policies, they were unclear on the full implications, if any, of this change. DOD has processes for maintaining and reporting consistent data on incidents of unwanted sexual behaviors including sexual assault and incidents of domestic violence that involve sexual assault, but does not have similar processes for maintaining and reporting data on incidents of sexual harassment. Specifically, DOD uses centralized databases to maintain and report data on incidents of sexual assault and domestic violence that involve sexual assault, but relies on military service-specific databases for information on incidents of sexual harassment. DOD has not established standard data elements and definitions to guide the services in maintaining and reporting data on sexual harassment. Inconsistencies in data elements and definitions generally mean that one service may be maintaining data that is more or less detailed than, or that differs from, the data maintained by other services. Such inconsistencies may create difficulties in reporting department-wide sexual harassment data, since the individual service data must be adapted to fit reporting requirements. DOD has several overarching efforts to address unwanted sexual behaviors across the continuum of harm, including developing an overarching prevention strategy. However, it is unclear whether the strategy under development will contain key elements for long-term and results-oriented strategic planning such as long-term goals, strategies to achieve goals, and metrics to gauge progress. Without incorporating these elements into its overarching prevention strategy, DOD may not be in a position to effectively coordinate and integrate prevention activities and reduce instances of unwanted sexual behaviors. GAO recommends that DOD fully include in its new policy on sexual harassment CDC's principles for sexual violence prevention and mechanisms for anonymous reporting, develop standard data elements and definitions for reporting sexual harassment incidents, and incorporate in its overarching prevention strategy elements key for a long-term, results-oriented strategy. DOD generally concurred with the recommendations."], "length": 12626}
