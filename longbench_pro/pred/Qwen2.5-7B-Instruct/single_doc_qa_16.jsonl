{"pred": " Several observations can be made from the table. First notice that, overall, the best performance is achieved by the neural network architecture that uses multitask learning. This entails that the system makes use of the available resources efficiently and improves the state-of-the-art performance. In conjunction with the fact that we found the optimal probability of dropout, this highlights the benefits of multitask learning over single task learning. Furthermore, as described above, the neural network-based models have only access to the training data as the development are hold for early stopping.
