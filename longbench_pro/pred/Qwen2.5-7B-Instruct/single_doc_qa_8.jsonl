{"pred": " Previous work on LID of South African languages primarily focuses on shallow methods such as naive Bayes classifiers, SVMs, and character n-gram models. Hierarchical stacked classifiers, including lexicons, are also used to first classify text by language group and then by specific language. Data augmentation and adversarial training approaches are considered useful to reduce the need for data. Deeper models like bidirectional recurrent neural networks and ensembles of recurrent neural networks have also been explored, achieving high accuracy in some tasks. The approach involves building lexicons and using hierarchical classifiers to improve precision and recall. Fasttext and other efficient classifiers are also utilized.
