Snowden, a former contractor for Booz Allen Hamilton, disclosed classified information to the Guardian and The Washington Post, revealing the NSA's collection of telephone and Internet data, which he termed an \"existential threat to democracy.\" The Obama administration maintains that the surveillance programs are necessary for national security and undergo regular review by all three branches of government. However, critics argue that the programs infringe on privacy and may not effectively prevent terrorism. Snowden's actions have garnered support from some liberals and conservatives, who view him as a hero for exposing government overreach, while others, including Senator Dianne Feinstein, question the extent of his access to classified information. The controversy has led to calls for reform and raised concerns about potential extradition. Julian Assange advised Snowden to seek asylum in Latin America, citing the region's strong tradition of protecting human rights and offering political asylum. Meanwhile, the U.S. government has initiated an investigation into Snowden, with federal agents searching his home and interviewing his associates. The debate over the NSA's surveillance programs continues, highlighting the tension between national security and individual privacy. Key evidence includes classified documents and court orders, as well as statements from government officials and whistleblowers. Innovative points include the use of computer forensics in investigating Snowden and the potential impact of his disclosures on public trust in government institutions. The situation underscores the ongoing challenge of balancing security and privacy in the digital age. The former British colony of Hong Kong, with its separate legal system, has been considered a potential safe haven for Snowden due to its protections for free speech and political dissent. However, the extradition treaty with the U.S. includes exceptions for political crimes and cases where extradition would harm national interests. Snowden's choice of Hong Kong reflects his strategic planning and the territory's reputation for press freedom. Despite the legal complexities, Snowden's actions have sparked a broader conversation about the balance between national security and individual rights, with supporters and detractors presenting contrasting views on the necessity and effectiveness of the surveillance programs. The controversy has also highlighted the potential for international cooperation in addressing national security threats, as evidenced by the collaboration between the U.S. and other countries in counterterrorism efforts.

This discovery, made using the Hubble Space Telescope, suggests a discrepancy between the rate of expansion measured in the present and the rate inferred from the cosmic microwave background radiation, the afterglow of the Big Bang. The new measurements imply that the universe is expanding 5% to 9% faster than predicted, which could be attributed to unknown subatomic particles, dark energy, or even a flaw in Einstein's theory of relativity. The precision of these new measurements, with a margin of error of only 2.4%, has led to a significant challenge for cosmologists, who must now reconcile this new data with existing models of the universe. The discrepancies highlight the need for further research into the nature of dark matter and dark energy, which together make up 95% of the universe but remain poorly understood. The findings also suggest that the universe's expansion may be driven by forces that are not yet fully accounted for, potentially leading to a reassessment of our understanding of the fundamental laws of physics. The Hubble Space Telescope's latest measurements of the universe's expansion rate, which show a 5% to 9% faster expansion than previously predicted, have sparked a significant debate in the scientific community. These findings, based on the accurate measurement of distances to 19 faraway galaxies, challenge the consistency between current observations and predictions from the cosmic microwave background radiation. The new Hubble constant value of 73.2 kilometers per second per megaparsec indicates that the universe will double in distance between cosmic objects in about 9.8 billion years. This discrepancy could be due to unknown subatomic particles, dark energy, or even a flaw in Einstein's theory of relativity.

Monis, an Iranian cleric with a history of violent criminal offenses, was granted political asylum in Australia in 2001. He faced multiple charges, including sending offensive letters to the families of deceased Australian soldiers, being an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife, and numerous sexual and indecent assault charges. Monis was on bail for these offenses and had a history of grievances against the Australian government. His legal battles, particularly his unsuccessful High Court appeal against his conviction for sending offensive letters, appear to have contributed to his mental state and eventual decision to carry out the siege. The passages highlight Monis' radicalization, his self-radicalization driven by grievances against the government and increasing marginalization among his peers, and his belief in a powerful ideology that clouded his judgment. The siege was a culmination of his frustrations and perceived injustices, and it ended with the deaths of Monis and two hostages. The passages also discuss the broader implications for security and the challenges in preventing such incidents, noting that Monis was known to authorities but not on a terror watch list. The key evidence includes Monis' criminal history, his legal battles, and his self-radicalization, which were well-documented by Australian authorities. The unique points made include the complexity of preventing lone-wolf attacks and the need for better strategic planning and evaluation of human capital flexibilities like retention incentives to address staffing challenges in institutions like the Federal Bureau of Prisons.

This discrepancy between the new measurements and predictions based on the cosmic microwave background radiation from the Big Bang poses significant challenges for cosmologists. The new findings suggest that there may be unknown subatomic particles, similar to neutrinos, traveling nearly as fast as light, or that dark energy, a mysterious force driving the accelerated expansion of the universe, may be more powerful than initially believed. Additionally, the discrepancy could indicate that Einstein's theory of relativity might be incomplete or that there are other physical processes affecting the expansion of the universe. These findings highlight the complexity of the universe and the need for further research to understand the underlying mechanisms driving cosmic expansion. Astronomers are refining their measurements to reduce uncertainties and explore potential explanations, such as the nature of dark matter and dark energy, which constitute about 95% of the universe but remain poorly understood. The improved accuracy of the Hubble constant, achieved through innovative techniques and precise distance measurements to faraway galaxies, provides crucial data for resolving this cosmic puzzle. The discrepancies between the new Hubble constant and earlier estimates from the cosmic microwave background radiation underscore the need for a deeper understanding of the universe's fundamental properties and the forces shaping its expansion. The findings also emphasize the ongoing quest to reconcile theoretical predictions with observational data, highlighting the dynamic and evolving nature of our understanding of the cosmos.

The research indicates that e-cigarette use is not merely a substitute for smoking but may be attracting a new group of users who would not have initiated smoking if e-cigarettes were not available. This finding is supported by data showing a significant increase in combined e-cigarette and cigarette use among adolescents, surpassing historical smoking rates. The studies also reveal that e-cigarette use is associated with a higher likelihood of subsequent cigarette smoking, particularly among those who were not initially inclined to smoke. Key evidence includes longitudinal data from the Southern California Children’s Health Study, which tracked e-cigarette and cigarette use among high school seniors from 1995 to 2014, demonstrating that the combined prevalence of e-cigarette or cigarette use in 2014 was higher than historical smoking rates. Additionally, the studies suggest that e-cigarettes may introduce nicotine addiction and pose health risks, despite being perceived as less harmful than traditional cigarettes. Innovative points include the use of detailed longitudinal data to track trends over two decades and the exploration of the potential gateway effect of e-cigarettes on cigarette smoking. The research underscores the need for further investigation into the long-term health impacts of e-cigarette use and the development of comprehensive public health strategies to address the rising rates of nicotine use among adolescents. The studies also highlight the importance of regulating e-cigarettes to prevent their use by non-smokers and to mitigate potential health risks.

This conclusion is supported by data showing a significant increase in combined e-cigarette and cigarette use among adolescents, surpassing historical smoking rates. Key evidence comes from the Southern California Children’s Health Study, which tracked e-cigarette and cigarette use among high school seniors from 1995 to 2014, revealing that the combined prevalence of e-cigarette or cigarette use in 2014 was higher than historical smoking rates. Additionally, the studies indicate that e-cigarette use is associated with a higher likelihood of subsequent cigarette smoking, particularly among those who were not initially inclined to smoke.

Another USC study finds older teens who try vaping are six times more likely to try a tobacco-filled cigarette than non-vapers, per a press release. \"E-cigarettes may be recruiting a new group of kids to tobacco use,\" says Jessica Barrington-Trimis, lead author of both studies. While e-cigs may seem safer than tobacco, if they come pumped with nicotine (some don't), kids can get addicted. The New York Times notes chemicals in the vaping liquid may be harmful; WebMD adds long-term effects are unknown. Using participants from USC's Children's Health Study, scientists followed 5,490 teens who graduated high school in select years between 1995 and 2015, asking them via questionnaire about their tobacco use. It's true that rates among Southern California teens who said they had smoked over the past 30 days fell significantly from 1995 to 2004 (19% to 9%), and slightly more in the decade after that (a bit less than 8% by 2014). But when teens were asked to include e-cigarettes in their assessments, the smoking rate jumped back up to 14% in 2014. And that's got scientists worried, especially with the prevalence of e-cigarettes that come in kid-friendly flavors such as cotton candy. \"E-cigarettes may be safer than regular cigarettes for adults who are transitioning from smoking to vaping, but for youth who have never used any other tobacco products, nicotine experimentation could become nicotine addiction,\" Barrington-Trimis says."], "length": 25836}
{"pred": " The revelations by Edward Snowden about the National Security Agency's (NSA) extensive surveillance programs have sparked intense debate and legal action. Snowden, a former contractor for Booz Allen Hamilton, disclosed classified information to the Guardian and The Washington Post, revealing the NSA's collection of telephone and internet data. He claims these programs pose an \"existential threat to democracy\" and aims to expose the government's overreach. Federal agents have begun investigating Snowden, who has fled to Hong Kong, seeking temporary asylum in Russia. The White House acknowledges the need for a public debate on the issue but expresses willingness to consider changes if the debate leads to a consensus. Snowden's choice of Hong Kong as a refuge is based on its press freedom and the extradition treaty, which includes exceptions for political offenses. Julian Assange advises Snowden to seek asylum in Latin America, citing its tradition of protecting human rights and providing sanctuary. The controversy has drawn both criticism and support, with some viewing Snowden as a hero for exposing government overreach and others labeling him a traitor. The debate centers on the balance between national security and individual privacy, with supporters of the surveillance programs arguing they have prevented terrorist attacks, while critics contend they infringe on civil liberties. Key evidence includes classified documents and court orders detailing the NSA's surveillance activities, and the government's assertion that these programs are necessary for national security. Unique points include the tension between Hong Kong's semi-autonomous status and its extradition treaty with the U.S., and the suggestion that Snowden's actions could be influenced by geopolitical considerations. The debate also highlights the ongoing tension between the U.S. and China, with Snowden's case potentially impacting the bilateral relationship. The controversy has brought together unlikely allies, with both liberals and conservatives supporting Snowden, while others defend the surveillance programs as essential for national security.

In a study of over 30,000 twins, researchers found that boys born to older fathers scored higher on a \"geek index,\" which measures traits such as higher IQ, strong focus on subjects of interest, and social aloofness. This \"geek index\" was positively associated with future academic attainment, suggesting a phenotypic advantage for male offspring of older fathers. The study, conducted using data from the Twin Early Development Study (TEDS), controlled for various covariates and found that the association between paternal age and the \"geek index\" was mediated by genetic factors not correlated with age at fatherhood, indicating a role for de novo genetic factors. Another study, examining five VA medical centers, revealed that documentation of reviews of providers' clinical care after concerns were raised was inadequate, and timely reviews were often delayed. This lack of documentation and timely reviews hindered the ability of VA medical centers to make informed decisions about providers' privileges and to take appropriate actions when necessary. The study highlighted the need for VHA to strengthen its oversight and documentation requirements for such reviews. A third study, using data from the TEDS, found that male offspring of older fathers had higher \"geek index\" scores, a composite measure of high IQ, strong focus on the subject of interest, and social aloofness. This \"geek index\" was positively linked with future academic attainment, including key predictors of future socioeconomic status. The study also explored the molecular underpinnings of the effects of advanced paternal age on offspring, showing that the genetic, but not environmental, contribution to the variance of the \"geek index\" increased with paternal age. The study suggested that genetic influences on the \"geek index\" may extend beyond familial factors, potentially involving de novo genetic factors. The research provided new insights into the multifaceted nature of the advanced paternal age effects and explored the intricate links between advanced paternal age, autism, and talent. The findings indicated that while advanced paternal age is associated with some phenotypic advantages, such as higher \"geek index\" scores and better academic outcomes, these advantages are likely specific to the modern knowledge-based environment and may not have such advantageous effects historically.

The rediscovery of Anders solves a long-standing mystery in college basketball and offers a glimpse into the life of a once-celebrated athlete who chose to live in anonymity for decades. The documentary also sheds light on the team's dynamic, led by coach Guy Lewis, and the cultural significance of their performances, emphasizing the impact of Benny Anders and his peers on the sport. The unique aspect of the story lies in the persistence of the search and the innovative approach taken by the filmmakers to uncover Anders' whereabouts. The rediscovery of Anders not only completes the narrative of the Phi Slama Jama team but also highlights the enduring legacy of their achievements and the personal journey of one of its most memorable players.

The incident occurred over a period of nearly three weeks, with the woman being held captive and subjected to repeated sexual assaults. She managed to escape and file a complaint with the Japanese consulate in Kolkata. The police have arrested three suspects, with two more still at large. The case is part of a broader pattern of sexual violence in India, which has seen a series of high-profile rape cases in recent years. These cases have sparked public outrage and led to the implementation of stricter anti-rape laws, including doubling prison terms for rapists to 20 years and criminalizing voyeurism, stalking, and the trafficking of women.

In the 1840s, Joseph Smith received a divine revelation commanding the practice of plural marriage, which was a significant departure from the cultural and legal norms of the time. This principle was introduced gradually and confidentially among early members, with some participants experiencing intense spiritual struggles and trials. The revelation also emphasized the importance of eternal marriage, promising eternal blessings for those who adhered to the commandment. Key evidence includes testimonies from early members who experienced profound spiritual experiences that helped them overcome their initial resistance. Unique points include the distinction between sealings for time and eternity and the potential reasons why Joseph Smith entered into plural marriages, including his desire to protect Emma and his wife's feelings. The practice was eventually discontinued, but it remains a foundational aspect of the Church's history and heritage, with descendants of those who practiced plural marriage today. The passages highlight the complexity and challenges of introducing and maintaining such a controversial practice within a religious community. The Church now permits sealing to multiple spouses in certain circumstances, reflecting its ongoing engagement with this historical practice. The introduction of plural marriage tested the faith of early members and led to significant opposition, but it also resulted in spiritual growth and enduring family connections. The practice was initially introduced through divine revelation and was later discontinued through another revelation, emphasizing the Church's commitment to following God's will. The unique aspects of the practice, such as the distinction between sealings for time and eternity, provide insight into the complexities of early Church history and the challenges faced by its members. The legacy of plural marriage continues to shape the Church's identity and its approach to family and marriage today. The passages underscore the importance of spiritual witness and the transformative power of faith in overcoming societal and personal challenges. The Church's ongoing engagement with this historical practice reflects its commitment to understanding and honoring its past while adapting to contemporary values and beliefs.

The essay explains that Smith was ordered to take multiple wives by an angel who visited him three times between 1834 and 1842; in the last instance, the angel was armed with a sword and threatened a reluctant Smith. The leader, then married to first wife Emma, took his first plural wife, Fanny Alger, in Kirtland, Ohio. Smith and Alger ultimately separated, and the church relocated to Nauvoo, Ill., where he married many more women. The oldest was 56, and the youngest was 14-year-old Helen Mar Kimball; some were already married, a revelation the New York Times describes as the \"biggest bombshell for some.\" The essay explains that a number of marriages, including that with Kimball, were sealed \"for eternity alone,\" suggesting sexual relations weren't involved (the ones that did involve sex were \"for time and eternity\"). What did Emma think of all this? Per the essay, she was none too pleased, though at one time she did accept four of Smith's wives into their home.

The kicker is that two other games fell the wrong way in unexpected fashion, one on a \"phantom goal,\" sealing the US fate. Honduras rallied from two goals down to beat Mexico, and Panama rallied from one goal back to beat Costa Rica. Had either of those games gone the other way, or had the US even tied Trinidad and Tobago (which had previously been eliminated from qualifying), the Americans would have secured a spot in Russia for the 2018 competition. Of note: Phantom goal: The winning goal scored by Panama against Costa Rica didn't cross the goal line, per CBS Sports, which has video here. The story raises the faint hope that the US could appeal the goal ruling, but it seems unlikely. \"As far as I know, there is no recourse,\" says a US soccer official.

The authors argue that despite the health benefits of breastfeeding and the significant market demand, breast pumps remain largely unchanged since their inception, lacking in design and functionality. They draw attention to the outdated and cumbersome nature of current models, which can be noisy, difficult to clean, and embarrassing to use. The articles cite various user experiences, such as pumping in public spaces with limited privacy and facing judgment from others, to illustrate the challenges faced by new mothers. The authors also mention the financial burden of purchasing breast pumps and the lack of support for low-income women, further underscoring the need for better solutions. Additionally, the passages discuss the broader implications of improving breast pump technology, including its potential to enhance the lives of working mothers and contribute to healthier outcomes for both mothers and infants. The unique perspective is that of a male author reflecting on the experience of his wife, adding a fresh viewpoint to the conversation. The context is set by the \"Make the Breast Pump Not Suck\" hackathon, which aims to address these issues through innovation and collaboration. The overall argument is that there is a critical need for technological advancements and policy changes to make breast pumping more accessible, comfortable, and dignified for new mothers. The key evidence includes user testimonials, market data, and the historical context of breast pump design. Innovative points include the suggestion of integrating technology and design improvements to create a more user-friendly and efficient breast pump, as well as the call for policy changes to support working mothers and improve access to better breast pump technology. The hackathon serves as a catalyst for bringing together diverse experts to tackle this longstanding issue. The articles collectively advocate for a multi-faceted approach to solving the problems associated with breast pumps, combining technological innovation, policy reform, and user-centered design. The goal is to make the breast pump experience more enjoyable and less burdensome for new mothers, thereby encouraging more widespread breastfeeding and supporting the health and well-being of both mothers and infants. The hackathon and the broader discussion aim to catalyze meaningful change in this critical area of maternal and neonatal health. The hackathon itself is presented as a platform for fostering creativity and collaboration to address the shortcomings of breast pumps, highlighting the potential for technological and design innovations to improve the experience for new mothers.

{"pred": " The research described in Passage 3 and Passage 4 presents a breakthrough in brain-computer interface (BCI) technology that enables communication with patients suffering from complete locked-in state (CLIS) due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This technology, utilizing functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), allows patients to answer 'yes' or 'no' questions by modulating their brain activity, specifically changes in oxygenation levels in the frontocentral region. The study involved four ALS patients in CLIS, who were trained to respond to personal and open-ended questions, with an above-chance-level correct response rate exceeding 70% over several weeks. Key evidence includes the successful classification of 'yes' and 'no' responses using SVM classifiers and the positive answers to quality-of-life questions, indicating patient satisfaction despite their condition. Unique aspects of this research include the use of fNIRS for non-invasive monitoring and the potential for real-time feedback during communication sessions. The findings suggest that complete locked-in states may be abolished, offering hope for improved quality of life and communication for affected individuals. Passage 4 elaborates on the implications and potential of this technology, highlighting its transformative impact on the lives of locked-in patients. It mentions that the technology allows patients to answer 'yes' or 'no' questions, enabling them to communicate about their quality of life, with all four patients indicating happiness. The study involved three women and one man, aged 24 to 76, who were in CLIS due to ALS. The researchers used a cap with infrared sensors to detect changes in blood flow patterns in the brain, which were then analyzed by a computer to distinguish 'yes' from 'no' responses. The technology's success is evidenced by the patients' ability to answer personal and open-ended questions, with some unexpected results, such as a patient's repeated refusal of marriage advice. The study suggests that locked-in syndrome might not be as dire as commonly perceived, as patients can maintain a positive outlook on life. The research also opens the door for further development of more proactive communication systems, potentially allowing patients to communicate more actively and independently. Together, these passages demonstrate the potential of fNIRS-based BCI technology to revolutionize communication for locked-in patients and improve their quality of life.

In other words, they had \"locked-in syndrome,\" meaning total motor paralysis in spite of normal cognitive and emotional processing. Researchers at the University of Tübingen in Germany fitted the patients with caps through which they could observe changes in blood flow in different parts of the brain, they explain in the journal PLOS Biology. They first asked the patients to think yes or no in response to simple statements such as their spouse's name, and moved on to more personal questions when that was mastered. “It’s the first sign that completely locked-in syndrome may be abolished forever, because with all of these patients, we can now ask them the most critical questions in life,” says researcher Niels Birbaumer. The patients, all of whom are on ventilators and being cared for at home, range in age from 24 to 76. The team did stumble on a couple surprises. For instance, all four patients suggested they were \"happy\" with their lives in spite of being locked-in. (Birmbaumer suggests this might be because of something akin to meditation.)

Kristopher Block, a 39-year-old mail carrier, is charged with felony official misconduct and misdemeanor theft. The investigation began when authorities found 11,000 pieces of mail in a ravine in Michigan, which were traced back to the La Porte Post Office where Block worked. Block admitted to paying a friend to burn mail he couldn't deliver on a regular basis. He resigned from his job on February 7, 2017. The case highlights the importance of accountability in the postal service and the potential consequences for employees who abuse their positions. Key evidence includes the discovery of the mail bundles in Michigan and Block's admission to burning mail. Innovative points include the use of a \"clamshell\" design for a new type of pet headgear that allows for safer and more comfortable restraint, and the incorporation of a pleasant sensory zone to reduce anxiety and stress for pets during handling. The clamshell design enables the headgear to be applied from behind the animal, reducing the risk of bites or aggression. The pleasant sensory zone can deliver stimuli such as pheromones, flavors, or sounds to calm the pet and facilitate handling. This design addresses the drawbacks of existing muzzles and restraints, offering a more humane and practical solution for pet care and transportation. The case also underscores the financial challenges faced by the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund, which supports coal miners affected by black lung disease. The fund relies on an excise tax on coal, but declining coal production and increased rates of black lung disease have put pressure on the fund's finances. The trust fund has accumulated debt and continues to borrow from the general fund to meet its obligations. Innovative solutions to improve the fund's financial outlook include extending the current excise tax rates, forgiving interest or debt, or reducing the scope and generosity of benefits. The clamshell headgear design and the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund case both highlight the importance of innovation in addressing practical challenges in pet care and public health, respectively. The headgear offers a safer and more humane solution for restraining pets, while the trust fund seeks sustainable solutions to ensure the financial stability of a crucial public health program.

More from Syria: The rebels today blew up one oil pipeline and one gas pipeline near Deir al-Zour, the AP reports, citing state media. Meanwhile, at least 20 people were killed in government airstrikes on rebel areas last night and this morning, activists say. Though Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has tried to shield Damascus, war has now reached the capital, the New York Times reports. The fighting isn't as intense as in other cities like Aleppo or Homs, but it's drastically increased since a few months ago: Checkpoints abound, kidnappings are common, bombings are increasing, and it's not safe to go out after dark. \"How soon before our city, our markets, are destroyed?\" wonders one resident. Similarly, Syria's wealthy—many of whom back the president—are now seeing their businesses hurt by the war, and some are losing faith in Assad, the AP reports. Many have seen factories burned or otherwise affected by fighting, and others have had their money restricted by sanctions. Yet more trouble for Assad: Even his own sect, the Alawite minority, is growing discontent, the Washington Post reports. Alawites had been strong backers of Assad, as the Sunni majority backed the rebellion, because they feared losing power to Sunni Islamists. But, though there is no indication that Alawites plan to join the rebellion, there are reports of rifts even within Assad's own extended family."], "length": 25606}

Thirty states have borrowed from the federal government to cover unemployment benefits, while others are increasing payroll taxes or cutting benefits. Virginia, for instance, has raised its unemployment tax from $95 to $171 per worker, impacting businesses and potentially hindering job creation. Additionally, some states are cutting benefits for senior citizens and limiting payments to Social Security recipients. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that many states have depleted their unemployment trust funds, necessitating these measures. The crisis highlights the importance of better financial planning and support for both businesses and unemployed individuals during economic downturns. Key evidence includes the data on tax increases and benefit cuts in various states, as well as the impact on businesses and seniors in Virginia.

{"pred": " \n\nThe passage discusses a significant shift in medical practice regarding the removal of cancerous lymph nodes from the armpit of breast cancer patients. Traditionally, surgeons have removed lymph nodes to prevent cancer spread and recurrence, but a new study reveals that for approximately 20% of patients, this procedure is unnecessary. The study, involving 891 patients, found that removing cancerous lymph nodes did not improve survival rates, reduce recurrence, or offer any advantages. Instead, it can lead to complications such as infection and lymphedema. The decision to remove lymph nodes is now contingent on whether patients undergo chemotherapy and radiation, which effectively eliminate disease in the nodes. The trend towards less invasive procedures is part of a broader movement away from radical surgery for breast cancer, reflecting a deeper understanding of the disease's nature and the effectiveness of modern treatments. The new findings challenge long-held beliefs and may lead to changes in medical practice, although some resistance persists due to the deep-rooted nature of these practices. The passage also highlights the evolving criteria for awarding the Purple Heart, particularly in cases involving domestic terrorism and acts of violence. The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 trial demonstrated that among patients with limited sentinel lymph node metastatic breast cancer treated with breast conservation and systemic therapy, the use of sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) alone compared with axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) did not result in inferior survival. The trial involved 891 patients and showed that overall survival and disease-free survival were comparable between the two groups. The study found that ALND did not significantly affect overall or disease-free survival, suggesting that the morbidity associated with ALND may not justify its use in this patient population. The findings support the use of SLND alone for patients with positive sentinel lymph nodes, as it achieves high rates of locoregional control without the complications of ALND. The study's results have important implications for clinical practice, potentially reducing the morbidity associated with ALND and improving quality of life for thousands of women annually. The passage also notes that the decision to award the Purple Heart for acts of violence, including those motivated by domestic terrorism, is becoming more subjective, potentially setting a precedent for future eligibility criteria.

In 1859, Adele Brise, a Belgian immigrant, claimed to have been visited by Mary three times, instructing her to teach Catholic beliefs to children. After a thorough investigation lasting two years, Bishop David L. Ricken of Green Bay declared with moral certainty that Brise indeed had encounters of a supernatural character that are worthy of belief. This validation makes Our Lady of Good Help one of only about a dozen sites worldwide, and the first in the United States, where such apparitions have been officially recognized by the Church. The decision comes at a time when the Catholic Church is facing numerous challenges, including revelations of sexual abuse, and is seen as a source of hope and healing for believers. The validation is based on the consistency of Brise's account with accepted cases and the absence of evidence of fraud or heresy. The shrine has seen an increase in visitors since the validation, with some traveling several hours to pray and seek divine intervention. The unique aspect of this validation is its recognition of a site in the United States, highlighting the global significance of Marian apparitions in Catholic tradition. The passage also mentions the ongoing legal troubles faced by the Diocese of Green Bay in an abuse-related lawsuit, which adds context to the significance of this validation for the Church.

The center emphasizes that every blood type is needed and provides a website link for potential donors to find nearby donation locations. Additionally, the passage highlights that the Zika virus situation has worsened, with concerns that flooding could lead to an increase in mosquito populations and, consequently, a higher risk of Zika transmission. Experts warn that once floodwaters recede, there could be a resurgence of mosquitoes, potentially exacerbating the Zika threat. The passage cites Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, who notes that the Aedes aegypti mosquito, known to carry the Zika virus, could be protected in containers like tires or buckets during the floods and then hatch after the waters recede. This could result in a significant increase in the mosquito population, posing a greater risk for Zika transmission. The passage also mentions that while floodwaters often wash away mosquito eggs, they can be protected in containers and hatch later, leading to a potential increase in the mosquito population and the risk of Zika. The overall argument is that both blood donations and vigilance against the Zika virus are crucial in the aftermath of the flooding. The key evidence includes the blood shortage at the 'South Texas Blood and Tissue Center' and the potential for increased mosquito populations and Zika transmission due to the flooding. Unique points include the emphasis on the need for all blood types and the specific concern about the Aedes aegypti mosquito's resilience in flooded areas.

While the current outbreak in Uganda has led to four fatalities, the country's experience in managing previous outbreaks of both Ebola and Marburg suggests that it is well-equipped to handle the situation. The virus spreads through direct contact with infected individuals or animals, and there is no specific cure or vaccine. Key evidence includes the 2012 Marburg outbreak in Uganda, which infected 15 people and resulted in four deaths, and the successful containment of the virus through rigorous surveillance and disease control measures. Innovative points include the emphasis on the importance of early detection and containment strategies, as well as the potential for experimental treatments being developed by companies working on Ebola drugs. Additionally, the passage outlines the challenges and procedures for requesting Fire Management Assistance Grants (FMAGs) from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for fire suppression activities, highlighting the cost-sharing requirements and the criteria used to evaluate wildfire threats. The FMAG system, established in 2001, provides federal assistance for fire suppression activities on public or private forest land or grassland, requiring a 25% cost-share from state, local, and tribal governments. The system uses fire cost thresholds to determine eligibility, with varying thresholds by state, and offers assistance for equipment, personnel, and grants. The process involves submitting a request to FEMA, which evaluates the request based on factors such as the threat to lives and property, the availability of state and local fire resources, and the potential economic impacts of the fire.

Damon argues that while some behaviors require criminal punishment, others are merely shameful and gross, implying a need for societal reflection and dialogue rather than immediate condemnation. Meanwhile, Passage 4 delves into Matt Damon's perspective on the current cultural shift regarding sexual misconduct, emphasizing the importance of recognizing different levels of behavior and advocating for personal responsibility. Damon acknowledges the need to address all forms of misconduct but cautions against conflating them, suggesting that men should not dictate the terms of abuse.

As a result, women are resorting to self-induced abortions, often using unregulated methods, which pose significant health risks. Women on Web, a Dutch not-for-profit organization, has received numerous emails from US women seeking assistance to end their pregnancies, highlighting the desperation and lack of options faced by many. The organization shares stories of women who are unable to afford abortions, face legal and social pressures, and are forced to explore dangerous methods. The rise in self-induced abortions is linked to economic downturns and the closure of clinics, indicating a correlation between access to healthcare and reproductive rights. The Trump administration's potential rollback of abortion rights could exacerbate this issue, as women may be forced to take more extreme measures. Innovative solutions, such as providing information on self-administered abortion drugs, are being explored to address the gap in accessible abortion services.

This caused significant traffic congestion and emergency response delays. The lane closures were allegedly politically motivated, targeting Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich for not endorsing Christie in the 2013 gubernatorial election.

This practice, while challenging and controversial, was seen as a restoration of ancient biblical principles and a means to fulfill God's purposes, including raising up seed and ensuring eternal family connections. Key evidence supporting the practice includes Joseph Smith's receipt of a revelation in 1831 and the subsequent introduction of the practice among early Church members. Despite initial resistance, many members eventually embraced the principle through spiritual experiences and testimonies. Unique to this practice is the concept of eternal marriage, where couples can be sealed for eternity, allowing for the continuation of families across generations. The practice was discontinued in the late 19th century, but its legacy continues through the descendants of those who practiced it and the enduring belief in eternal family connections. The introduction of plural marriage tested the faith of early members and required significant personal sacrifice, yet it also brought about spiritual growth and unity within the Church. The practice was not uniformly accepted, with some members leaving the Church or refusing to participate, but many found strength and purpose in adhering to the divine commandment.

The essay explains that Smith was ordered to take multiple wives by an angel who visited him three times between 1834 and 1842; in the last instance, the angel was armed with a sword and threatened a reluctant Smith. The leader, then married to first wife Emma, took his first plural wife, Fanny Alger, in Kirtland, Ohio. Smith and Alger ultimately separated, and the church relocated to Nauvoo, Ill., where he married many more women. The oldest was 56, and the youngest was 14-year-old Helen Mar Kimball; some were already married, a revelation the New York Times describes as the \"biggest bombshell for some.\" The essay explains that a number of marriages, including that with Kimball, were sealed \"for eternity alone,\" suggesting sexual relations weren't involved (the ones that did involve sex were \"for time and eternity\").

He says in its original location near a pub, the devices could have caused carnage. \"If that pub was crowded and there was a lot of people there, it could have severely injured, killed and maimed many, many people,\" the mayor says. The AP reports that thousands of Amtrak and NJ Transit passengers were affected by the discovery of the device, with some stuck on trains for hours. Service has resumed but passengers in the area have been warned that they can expect delays Monday. NBC New York reports that investigators believe surveillance video shows the same man at two locations where explosive devices were found in Manhattan. Police aren't sure whether there is a link between the New York devices and those found in New Jersey. CNN reports that there is now an increased security presence in New York City not just because of the bombs, but because world leaders are gathering for the United Nations General Assembly. A law enforcement source tells CBS that investigators believe cell phones were used as triggers for both the Manhattan blast—which NY Gov. Andrew Cuomo calls \"obviously an act of terrorism\"—and the device that exploded before a New Jersey race to benefit Marines and sailors early Saturday. It's not clear whether a trigger was found with the Elizabeth devices. Bollwage says he's not sure his city was targeted. He suspects somebody may have just dumped the devices in Elizabeth, but he is \"extremely concerned for everyone in the state and country where someone can just go and drop a backpack into a garbage can that has multiple explosives in it with no timers and then you have to wonder how many people could have been hurt.\" An official close to the investigation tells Reuters that all the devices involved have been crude and the level of planning appears low—but some investigators fear this was just a test. \"That's what worries us,\" he says. \"Was this some kind of test run, not just of the devices, but also of the surveillance in New York and the response?\" (The FBI says it is questioning five people found in a \"vehicle of interest.\")"], "length": 26182}

The runoff election, which was necessary because neither candidate achieved a majority in the initial vote, highlighted the contentious nature of the race. Hyde-Smith, who was appointed to the Senate in April, faced significant controversy over her controversial statement about attending a \"public hanging,\" which evoked Mississippi's dark history of racism and violence. Despite the controversy, Hyde-Smith capitalized on her support for President Trump and portrayed Espy as too liberal for Mississippi. Trump's presence at two rallies in the state further bolstered Hyde-Smith's campaign. Espy, a former Secretary of Agriculture, attempted to appeal to both black and white voters by emphasizing bipartisanship and economic growth. The election results underscored Mississippi's long-standing Republican leanings, with the state having not elected a Democrat to the Senate since 1982. The runoff also revealed the challenges faced by Democrats in traditionally red states, as Espy struggled to overcome the historical and cultural barriers in Mississippi. Key evidence included the nearly 8 percentage point margin of victory for Hyde-Smith and the demographic makeup of Mississippi, where 38% of the population is black. Unique points included the controversy surrounding Hyde-Smith's comments and the significant role played by Trump in the election. The election results also highlighted the potential for narrow margins in special elections and the importance of local issues in shaping voter preferences.

Huth's lawyer, Marc Strecker, has filed a sworn declaration stating that he has interviewed two witnesses who corroborate her story, and a clinical psychologist has also provided a declaration supporting Huth's claim of childhood sexual abuse. The Los Angeles Police Department is currently investigating Huth's allegations, which come amidst a growing number of accusations against Cosby, including claims from Chloe Goins and others that he drugged and sexually assaulted them. Bill Cosby's attorney, Martin Singer, has dismissed these allegations as an extortion attempt and is seeking to have Huth's lawsuit dismissed. Meanwhile, the Navy has faced significant challenges in maintaining the readiness and operational effectiveness of its fleet, with persistent low readiness levels and numerous mishaps at sea. The Navy has attributed these issues partly to increased deployment lengths and shortened maintenance and training periods to meet high demand for its ships. Additionally, the Navy has struggled with the long-term effects of overseas homeporting, which has led to higher operational costs and reduced training and maintenance opportunities for crews. Despite efforts to address these challenges, the Navy continues to grapple with maintaining a sustainable operational schedule and ensuring the readiness of its ships. The passage of the Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) requires lobbyists to register with the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House and to file quarterly reports disclosing their lobbying activities. However, the act does not specify requirements for lobbyists to generate or maintain documentation to support the information in their reports. Guidance from the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House recommends that lobbyists retain copies of their filings and supporting documentation for at least six years. Despite these guidelines, the extent to which lobbyists can demonstrate compliance with the LDA by providing documentation remains a challenge. Recent reviews have shown that while many lobbyists do provide documentation, there is still significant variation in the amount and quality of documentation submitted. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia (USAO) plays a crucial role in enforcing LDA compliance, but the number of assigned personnel has decreased due to attrition.

The study involved 3,432 UK university staff and students aged 18-40 who had experienced sudden bereavement, with the results indicating an 80% increased likelihood of dropping out of education or work among those bereaved by suicide. Key evidence supporting this conclusion includes the adjusted risk of suicide attempts and occupational functioning when accounting for perceived social stigma, which suggests that addressing social stigma could mitigate these impacts. The study also underscores the importance of considering a history of suicide among non-blood relatives and friends in suicide risk assessments, as it may be a significant factor beyond family history.

This review, the largest of its kind, aims to identify wrongful convictions and provide new opportunities for appeals and DNA testing. The review stems from revelations that FBI hair examiners exaggerated the certainty of matches and provided flawed testimony in a vast majority of cases, raising serious concerns about the integrity of the justice system. Key evidence includes the findings from a 2012 investigation that revealed widespread problems in the FBI's forensic unit, as well as the admission that nearly every examiner in the unit gave flawed testimony in almost all trials over a two-decade period. The review is expected to address about 10 percent of the 2,600 questioned convictions and 60 death-row cases, with the potential to uncover wrongful convictions and bring about justice for those wrongly convicted. The process, while extensive, is seen as crucial for restoring public trust in forensic science and ensuring fair trials. Innovative aspects include the collaboration between the government and organizations like the Innocence Project to ensure transparency and fairness in the review process. The review also highlights the need for more rigorous standards and oversight in forensic science to prevent future miscarriages of justice. The review is part of a broader effort to address systematic weaknesses in forensic testimony and methods, with implications extending beyond the FBI to other forensic laboratories and the legal system as a whole.

The review's scope and impact suggest a significant shift in how forensic evidence is handled and evaluated in the criminal justice system.

Women Help Women, an international advocacy group, has launched a new web portal called \"Self-managed Abortion, Safe and Supported\" (SASS) to provide guidance and support to US women who wish to terminate their pregnancies using abortion-inducing drugs. This initiative aims to address the gap in access to safe abortion services, especially for those who cannot afford clinic-based abortions or live in areas with restrictive laws. The portal connects women with counselors who can provide step-by-step instructions and answer questions in real-time, emphasizing safety and support. Despite the potential legal risks, the project seeks to empower women by offering them information and guidance to manage their own abortions safely. The articles also discuss the historical context of self-induced abortions, noting that while the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision aimed to eliminate the practice, it has persisted due to economic and social barriers. The rise in self-induced abortions is linked to increased restrictions on abortion access, including financial barriers and limited clinic availability. Furthermore, the articles highlight the dangers and uncertainties associated with self-induced abortions, such as incomplete abortions, severe complications, and the potential for criminal charges. Despite these risks, the need for accessible and safe abortion options remains urgent, prompting organizations like Women on Web and Women Help Women to provide resources and support to women seeking to end their pregnancies. The unique aspect of the SASS project is its provision of real-time support and guidance, aiming to minimize the risks associated with self-induced abortions while respecting the legal gray area surrounding the practice. The articles underscore the importance of addressing the root causes of unsafe abortions, such as financial constraints and restrictive laws, to ensure women have safe and legal options for terminating pregnancies. The data and stories shared in the articles emphasize the real-world impact of these issues on women's lives, highlighting the need for comprehensive reproductive rights policies. The SASS project represents a proactive response to the challenges women face in accessing safe abortion services, offering a lifeline to those who might otherwise resort to dangerous methods. The articles also discuss the potential for increased self-induced abortions under a more restrictive political environment, as exemplified by the experiences of women who have turned to unconventional methods or international travel to obtain abortion drugs.

Key evidence includes documents detailing exploits for iOS, Android, and Windows, as well as specific projects like \"Weeping Angel,\" which turns Samsung TVs into covert microphones. The CIA's hacking arsenal also targets internet infrastructure and web servers, with tools designed to bypass encryption on messaging apps like WhatsApp and Signal. The dump raises concerns about the potential misuse of these tools and the broader implications for privacy and security. Unique points include the CIA's apparent disregard for public oversight, as evidenced by its hoarding of vulnerabilities and failure to disclose them to manufacturers, and the potential for these cyberweapons to spread globally, posing a significant proliferation risk. The scale of the leak surpasses previous disclosures, such as those from Edward Snowden, highlighting the CIA's expansive and covert digital operations. The release also prompts debates about the ethical and legal boundaries of state-sponsored hacking and the need for greater transparency and accountability in intelligence agencies. The redacted nature of the documents and the ongoing analysis by WikiLeaks underscore the complexity and significance of the information revealed. The dump challenges the notion that secure messaging apps like Signal and WhatsApp are invulnerable to government surveillance, suggesting that if a user's device is compromised, the apps offer little protection. The release of these documents has sparked discussions about the balance between national security and individual privacy, as well as the responsibilities of intelligence agencies in managing their cyberarsenal. The WikiLeaks dump also reveals the CIA's use of the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt as a covert base for its hackers, covering Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, and the agency's reliance on unclassified status for its cyberweapons to avoid legal constraints. The documents highlight the CIA's focus on developing malware that can bypass anti-virus software and the potential for these tools to be misattributed due to the fingerprinting of unique attack techniques. The release of \"Vault 7\" underscores the urgent need for public debate on the security, creation, use, proliferation, and democratic control of cyberweapons, as well as the broader implications for digital privacy and national security.

The storm has pushed water over a rural levee, flooding homes and immersing beach-front roads. In Plaquemines Parish, residents are stranded in attics and on rooftops due to rising floodwaters, with some areas experiencing up to 9 feet of water. Local residents with boats have begun rescue efforts, and the National Guard is preparing to launch a larger rescue operation. The Parish President, Billy Nungesser, is considering cutting a hole in the Mississippi River levee to drain the Braithwaite area, although the Army Corps opposes this plan. The storm has caused extensive damage, with some areas experiencing worse devastation than during Hurricane Katrina. Key evidence includes the number of people without power, the extent of flooding, and the reports of water levels reaching up to 9 feet in certain areas.

According to a study published in BMJ Open, people bereaved by the sudden death of a friend or family member are 65% more likely to attempt suicide if the deceased died by suicide compared to if they died by natural causes. This finding underscores the specific risk posed by suicide bereavement, which is not present in other types of sudden bereavement. The study, conducted on 3,432 UK university staff and students aged 18-40, also revealed that those bereaved by suicide were 80% more likely to drop out of education or work, with 8% of the participants having dropped out since the death. The research suggests that the increased risk of suicide attempts is not solely due to pre-existing mental health issues but is a consequence of the unique psychological trauma associated with a suicide loss. Additionally, the study found that people bereaved by suicide tend to perceive more social stigma around the death, which may exacerbate the risk of adverse outcomes. Addressing this stigma could be a key strategy to mitigate the impact of suicide bereavement. The passage from the UCL study further emphasizes the importance of considering non-blood relatives and friends in suicide risk assessments, as the risk of suicide attempt is not limited to those bereaved by blood relatives. The study also notes that repeated exposure to sudden losses may reduce the fear of death, potentially increasing the likelihood of suicide attempts. Innovative points include the use of a large, population-based sample and the distinction between different types of sudden bereavement, providing a more nuanced understanding of the risks associated with suicide bereavement. The findings have significant implications for mental health professionals and employers, highlighting the need for tailored support and interventions for those bereaved by suicide. The research underscores the importance of addressing the social stigma associated with suicide bereavement and the need for targeted interventions to prevent suicide attempts in this vulnerable group. The study's robust methodology, including the use of standardised measures and accounting for prebereavement psychopathology, adds credibility to the findings. The unique contribution of this research lies in its detailed examination of the specific impact of suicide bereavement on young adults, providing valuable insights for suicide prevention strategies and clinical practice.

{"pred": " \n\nThis summary focuses on the findings and implications of recent studies on the melting of Antarctica and its impact on global sea levels. According to a new study published in the journal Nature, the melting of Antarctica is accelerating at an alarming rate, with about 3 trillion tons of ice disappearing since 1992. The study, conducted by an international team of ice experts, reveals that from 1992 to 2011, Antarctica lost nearly 84 billion tons of ice annually, but from 2012 to 2017, the melt rate increased to more than 241 billion tons per year. This accelerated melting has contributed to a rise in global sea levels by approximately 0.6 mm annually since 2012. The study highlights that the West Antarctic region, where most of the melting occurs, is in a state of collapse, with warm ocean waters causing significant ice loss. The researchers emphasize that while the situation is dire, it is not too late to address the underlying climate change factors driving these changes. Additionally, the study underscores the importance of continuous monitoring and research to better understand and predict future ice sheet behavior and its impact on global sea levels. The passage also discusses the methods used in the study, including the integration of 24 different satellite assessments and ground and air measurements, to provide a comprehensive view of the ice sheet's condition. The authors caution that while the current trends are concerning, they do not yet provide definitive proof of human-induced climate change, but they do suggest that natural variability is unlikely to explain the observed changes. The study's findings highlight the urgent need for global action to mitigate climate change and adapt to rising sea levels. The passage further elaborates on the implications of these findings for coastal communities and the broader global economy, emphasizing the importance of considering Antarctica's contribution to sea-level rise in future planning and defense strategies. The summary concludes by noting that while the study provides a clearer picture of the current state of Antarctica's ice sheets, ongoing research is crucial to understanding the long-term impacts of climate change on these critical regions. The key evidence presented includes the extensive use of satellite data and ground measurements, which collectively indicate a significant and accelerating loss of ice mass in Antarctica. The unique aspect of this study lies in its comprehensive approach, combining multiple data sources to provide a more robust and reliable assessment of ice sheet dynamics.

The report, which took four years to compile and cost $40 million, details the CIA's misleading of the Bush administration and Congress about the effectiveness of these techniques and highlights that they did not provide actionable intelligence leading to Osama bin Laden's capture. The CIA has disputed some of the report's findings. The Senate Intelligence Committee has alleged that the CIA monitored computers used by committee staff to review the report, potentially violating an agreement against such actions. This has led to a criminal referral to the Justice Department. The White House has been closely monitoring the situation but has not intervened directly. The Senate has called for the White House to strip the CIA of control over the declassification process, suggesting that decisions about what should be made public should be handled by the White House instead. The passage also mentions that the Senate has requested the release of an internal CIA review that corroborates some of the committee's findings and acknowledges significant mistakes made during the CIA program. The conflict has heightened concerns about the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches, particularly regarding oversight of intelligence agencies. Mark Udall, a senator advocating for transparency, urged President Obama to publicly support the fullest possible declassification of the Senate Intelligence Committee's report on the CIA's detention and interrogation program. He emphasized that anything less would fail to set the record straight on this dark chapter of the CIA's history.

Key evidence from satellite observations and various studies indicates that Antarctica is losing ice at an alarming rate, with the rate of ice loss increasing from 84 billion tons per year from 1992 to 2011 to over 241 billion tons per year from 2012 to 2017. This acceleration is attributed to warmer ocean temperatures affecting the floating edges of glaciers, leading to increased melting and contributing to rising global sea levels. The study, involving 24 independent satellite assessments, confirms that the ice loss is predominantly occurring in West Antarctica and on the Antarctic Peninsula, with East Antarctica showing minimal net loss. The research underscores the urgent need for policymakers to address the impacts of climate change and rising sea levels, emphasizing that the situation is dire and potentially leading to significant sea level rise by the end of the century. Innovative approaches to understanding and mitigating these impacts include the use of multiple satellite technologies and ground-based measurements to provide comprehensive data on ice sheet dynamics and the integration of these findings into broader climate change mitigation strategies. The findings also suggest that the ice sheet's response to climate change is more complex than previously thought, with potential feedback mechanisms that could accelerate the melting process. The studies highlight the importance of continued monitoring and research to better predict and prepare for the consequences of ice sheet melting in Antarctica. The research also points to the role of implicit biases and social challenges, such as poverty and trauma, in shaping student behavior and discipline in schools, which can exacerbate disparities in school discipline.

{"pred": " The research by Kasumovic and Kuznekoff explores how male behavior towards women in online competitive environments, specifically in first-person shooter video games, is influenced by their status and performance. Using the online game Halo 3, the study found that lower-skilled male players were more hostile towards female teammates, especially when performing poorly, while higher-skilled players were more positive. This supports an evolutionary perspective that suggests lower-status males increase female-directed hostility to minimize the loss of status due to hierarchical reconfiguration caused by a female competitor. The study provides insights into the triggers of sexist behavior and highlights the importance of considering an evolutionary perspective in understanding such behavior. Key evidence includes the analysis of 163 game sessions where male players made comments to teammates, showing a correlation between player performance, status, and the frequency of positive or negative comments directed at female teammates. The research also emphasizes the unique opportunity that video games offer to study inter-sexual competition and suggests potential interventions to reduce sexist behavior, such as educating young males about the social implications of losing to the opposite sex. The study's innovative approach combines evolutionary theory with empirical data from online gaming to provide a clearer picture of sexist behavior in competitive environments.

This lake, located in Gale Crater, was likely freshwater and could have supported microbial life for long periods, possibly millions of years. The lake was fed by streams originating from mountains, similar to glacial periods in Earth's Western U.S. The rover analyzed mudstone samples, revealing clay minerals and key chemical elements for life, supporting the hypothesis that the lake could have sustained chemolithoautotrophic microbes, a type of microorganism that obtains energy from rocks and minerals. This discovery extends the timeline for potential life on Mars and paints a more complete picture of the ancient Martian environment, confirming and extending previous findings that the area was habitable. The research, published in six papers in the journal Science, provides insights into the geological and environmental conditions that could have supported life on Mars in the distant past. The findings also suggest that the Gale Crater area may have experienced a series of wet and dry periods, potentially lasting for millions of years, which could have provided diverse habitats for microbial life. The lack of weathering on the crater's rim indicates that the area was cold, possibly covered by ice, which could have supported chemolithoautotrophic microbes in a cold, icy environment.

Stevens, a successful businessman and family man, began gambling in Las Vegas and quickly became addicted, losing millions of dollars. Despite his wife's ignorance of his addiction, Stevens meticulously concealed his gambling habits and continued to gamble even after being fired from his job. His addiction led to the loss of his job, his family's financial stability, and ultimately his life. The passages highlight the devastating impact of gambling addiction and the casino industry's role in exploiting vulnerable individuals. Key evidence includes Stevens' detailed letter to his wife outlining his financial instructions and his final text messages to his family before taking his life. The passages also discuss the prevalence and nature of modern slot machines, which are designed to be highly addictive and profitable for casinos. Innovative points include the discussion of near-misses and unbalanced reel designs as tactics used by slot machines to keep players engaged and spending money. The passages argue that while Stevens' addiction was a personal tragedy, the casino industry's practices contribute to the exploitation of vulnerable individuals.

Scott Stevens was a successful Ohio finance exec whose life started unraveling in 2006 after a trade show in Vegas. For six years, his gambling habit spiraled out of control: He sneaked off to gamble when his wife thought he was working, embezzled nearly $4 million from his firm, and drained his family's savings—until the day in 2012 he decided to end his life. After his suicide, Stacy started researching gambling addiction (she hadn't even known about her husband's problem) and filed suit against the West Virginia casino where he was a regular, as well as the maker of the slot machines there. Experts relay how casinos track and target addicted gamblers, supply ready flows of cash via on-site ATMs, and offer plenty of perks to keep them coming back. But it's the modern-day slot machines themselves, with deceptive technology called virtual reel mapping, that seem to be designed to lull gamblers into a trance—or what the industry refers to as \"continuous gaming productivity\"—so they don't stop playing. While the casinos and machine manufacturers place the blame for gambling addictions on individuals, Terry Noffsinger, the lead attorney for the Stevens suit, says these addictive machines are not due to \"negligence. It's intentional.\" Stacy Stevens lost her case in West Virginia, but Noffsinger believes the movement to hold casinos accountable for addicts will gain momentum, much like how the tobacco industry eventually paid for sickening its own customers. \"The public is learning more about it,\" he says.

{"pred": " The groundbreaking research detailed in the articles presents a novel approach to communication for patients suffering from complete locked-in state (CLIS) due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), a brain-reading device, researchers were able to train four ALS patients in CLIS to answer 'yes' or 'no' questions by detecting patterns in their brain activity. This method allowed the patients to communicate about their quality of life, with all four indicating happiness, despite being unable to express themselves for years. The study, published in PLOS Biology, marks a significant advancement in overcoming the communication barriers faced by these patients. Key to the success was the use of fNIRS, which measures changes in brain hemodynamics, and the training process involved patients thinking 'yes' or 'no' in response to simple questions. The findings suggest that complete locked-in states may be abolished, offering hope for a more fulfilling life for those affected. Notably, the research also highlights the potential for further development of brain-reading technologies to enable more proactive communication, moving beyond mere responses to questions. This work opens new avenues for understanding and improving the lives of individuals with severe neurological conditions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Additionally, the article from The Guardian elaborates on the implications of this breakthrough for patients with CLIS. Neuroscientist Niels Birbaumer and his team at the University of Tübingen successfully used fNIRS to establish reliable communication with four patients in CLIS, all of whom indicated happiness with their lives. This method involves training patients to think 'yes' or 'no' in response to questions, with a computer learning to distinguish the corresponding brain activity patterns. The study, published in PLOS Biology, demonstrates that fNIRS can be a reliable tool for communication in CLIS, potentially transforming the lives of those affected. The researchers' next goal is to develop a system that allows more proactive communication, enhancing the quality of life for these patients.

In other words, they had \"locked-in syndrome,\" meaning total motor paralysis in spite of normal cognitive and emotional processing. Researchers at the University of Tübingen in Germany fitted the patients with caps through which they could observe changes in blood flow in different parts of the brain, they explain in the journal PLOS Biology. They first asked the patients to think yes or no in response to simple statements such as their spouse's name, and moved on to more personal questions when that was mastered. “It’s the first sign that completely locked-in syndrome may be abolished forever, because with all of these patients, we can now ask them the most critical questions in life,” says researcher Niels Birbaumer.

This plan, supported by several influential Democratic senators, seeks to replace the current fragmented health care system with a single-payer system where the government would provide medical insurance to all Americans. The bill is seen as a significant shift to the left within the Democratic Party, potentially setting the stage for a more liberal agenda in the 2020 presidential race. Key supporters include Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, and Cory Booker, among others. However, the bill faces resistance from some Democratic leaders and vulnerable incumbents who are concerned about the political and economic feasibility of such a drastic change. The bill's introduction comes amid ongoing debates about the future of the Affordable Care Act and the need to address rising health care costs. While the bill is unlikely to pass in the current political climate, its introduction marks a significant shift in the Democratic Party's stance on health care policy. The bill's supporters argue that it would make health care less expensive and less complicated for many people and businesses, while critics highlight the potential for higher taxes and the challenges of transitioning from the current system. The bill's supporters also emphasize the growing public support for a single-payer system, with 53% of Americans expressing support for a national health care plan. The introduction of the bill by Sanders and his allies signals a broader push within the Democratic Party to move towards a more progressive agenda, particularly on economic and social issues.

Co-payments would go away, and people would pay premiums based on their incomes, reports the AP. Private insurers would still exist, but for things such as elective plastic surgery or, sometimes, to act as middlemen between the government and hospitals or doctors.

In short, it \"describes a system in which only one entity—the government—pays medical bills. If all Americans had Medicare rather than insurance through their jobs, it would be a single-payer system.\" Vox says Sanders' system is far more generous than single-payer plans in Canada and elsewhere. The cost: This could cost hundreds of billions of dollars more per year, per the Journal. Details are yet to come, but Sanders envisions a progressive tax increase, with the wealthy paying more income, capital gains, and estate taxes, reports Newsweek.

According to CNN, the superstar flew to his hometown Monday to vote, taking a selfie in front of the Diebold voting machine in the process. Timberlake posted the photo to Instagram with the caption: \"Choose to have a voice! If you don't, then we can't HEAR YOU! Get out and VOTE!\" Now he could face 30 days in jail and/or a $50 fine. The local district attorney's office says the incident is \"under review.\" The Tennessee legislature passed the law banning the taking of photos and videos in polling stations in 2015, the Commercial Appeal reports.

The 20-year-old, whose bail was revoked two months ago when authorities discovered he had repeatedly violated his curfew, will be freed on bail again after he's fitted with a GPS monitor this week, reports the Boston Herald. Labrie's lawyer, Jaye Rancourt, says he has been frightened and sad during his time in prison, most of which was spent on administrative segregation, and he plans to abide by bail conditions, including living at his mother's home in Vermont under a 5pm to 8am curfew. After his conviction last year, Labrie was sentenced to a year in jail. Rancourt says Labrie will be working in manual labor while out on bail. The curfew violations that sent him to jail were exposed by a reporter he chatted to on a train. \"I think a regular person wouldn't have had his bail revoked,\" Rancourt says. \"I think he's been under intense scrutiny and probably treated more strictly than some.\" At Monday's hearing, Rancourt told the judge that jail time had been a \"life-changing\" experience for Labrie, though a state prosecutor argued that the only real change is that Labrie has discovered he doesn't like jail, reports WCVB.
