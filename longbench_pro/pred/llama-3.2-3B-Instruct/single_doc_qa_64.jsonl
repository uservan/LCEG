The proximity of superconductivity to the Kondo effect is a complex topic that has been the subject of much research and debate. While some studies suggest that superconductivity can enhance or even induce the Kondo effect, others propose that the two phenomena are mutually exclusive. The exact relationship between superconductivity and the Kondo effect is still not well understood and is the subject of ongoing research. Therefore, it is unanswerable to provide a concise answer to this question. \n\nNote: The"}

In reality, the net yield of ATP from glycolysis is 4 ATP, but this is not the case for one glucose molecule. The correct answer is 2 ATP, as glycolysis produces 2 ATP per glucose molecule, but 2 ATP are also consumed during the process. The net yield is therefore 0 ATP. However, I will follow the format and provide the simplified answer. \n\nCorrected answer: 0 ATP."}
