The film's poor performance is attributed to Spielberg's declining box office track record, the lack of a recognizable star, and the high production budget of $140 million. The film's failure to connect with audiences is also attributed to its confusing title and the fact that it is positioned as a children's movie but lacks the magic of Spielberg's past films.

That's left people wondering if the man who essentially invented the summer blockbuster with Jaws has lost his summertime feeling. Here's what some of the experts are saying: Slash Film argues you can't blame Spielberg for the failure, as he's far from the first director to flop when adapting a story by Roald Dahl. In fact, only one film based on a Dahl book—Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory—has made more than $34 million in US theaters. The Wrap has a list of seven reasons The BFG bombed, from \"Roald Dahl is no JK Rowling\" to a lack of stars and a confusing title. The BFG might be proof it's time for Spielberg to step away from family films, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which points out the director hasn't had a hit family film since Hook a quarter of a century ago. He's had better luck with recent grown-up fare like Lincoln and Bridge of Spies. The Wall Street Journal details Spielberg's history of being able to \"bounce back\" after cinematic disappointments, something he should have a good chance of doing with his next three films currently including a historical drama, a science-fiction movie based on a popular book, and an Indiana Jones sequel. But the \"reason this stings\" is because every other time Spielberg disappointed at the box office, it was with a \"good for you\" film, according to Forbes. Whereas The BFG was intended as a money-maker for the studio. Finally, Movie Pilot argues that the failure of The BFG shouldn't count against any future Spielberg or Dahl movies. \"The main issue of the movie is more about being unremarkable than disastrous.”"], "length": 56886}

The Ukrainian minister of the environment and natural resources, Ostap Semerak, has announced plans to develop solar power near the defunct Soviet reactors, with the goal of increasing the share of renewables in Ukraine's energy mix to 11% by 2020. The project aims to revive the exclusion zone, which has been abandoned since the 1986 nuclear disaster. The Ukrainian government is seeking investors to develop the solar complex, with expressions of interest from two U.S. investment firms and four Canadian energy companies. The project is expected to generate 4 MW of electricity and is part of Ukraine's efforts to increase its renewable energy capacity. The Chernobyl disaster has had a lasting impact on the region, with thousands of people displaced and many more affected by radiation.

Of the 11,000 people studied, 2% were vegetarians, 10% former vegetarians, and 88% lifelong meat-eaters.

The report, which analyzed data from 2010-2011, found that acute respiratory conditions such as colds, sore throats, and bronchitis are the main drivers of antibiotic overuse. The study concludes that reducing unnecessary antibiotic use can help slow the emergence of antibiotic-resistant microbes, also known as \"superbugs.\" The report sets national targets for eliminating unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions, with a goal of reducing outpatient antibiotic use by 15% overall by 2020. The authors emphasize the need for collaboration between healthcare providers, patients, and the healthcare industry to improve prescribing practices and preserve lifesaving antibiotics for those who need them. The report also highlights the importance of evaluating prescribing habits and implementing stewardship activities in healthcare practices, as well as providing expertise and resources to offices within healthcare networks. Additionally, the report notes that state and local health agencies can help develop regional partnerships between various healthcare stakeholders to coordinate stewardship efforts. The study's findings have significant implications for public health, as antibiotic resistance is a major threat to human health. The report's authors call for a national effort to address this issue, emphasizing the need for collective action to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use and promote responsible prescribing practices. The study's results are expected to inform the development of new guidelines and policies aimed at reducing antibiotic overuse and promoting the responsible use of these critical medications.

And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts—the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post—isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them. The Times notes President Obama's initiative to cut down on unnecessary outpatient antibiotic use by 50% by 2020; researchers say that, based on this study, we'll need to slash overall antibiotic use by 15% to meet that. \"If we continue down the road of inappropriate use we'll lose the most powerful tool we have to fight life-threatening infections,\" CDC Director Tom Frieden says. \"Losing these antibiotics would undermine our ability to treat patients with deadly infections [and] cancer, provide organ transplants, and save victims of burns and trauma.\" (Here's hoping teixobactin can help us out with superbugs.)"], "length": 55115}

The Pacific Fishery Management Council should set conservative catch limits on sardines to maintain a healthy Pacific Ocean. The council should also fulfill its September 2013 commitment to prohibit unregulated fishing on forage fish species such as sand lance, saury, and lanternfish.

The collapse of the sardine fishery in the mid-20th century and the current decline of sardines are likely linked to a naturally occurring climate cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation.

One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing.

{"pred": "Passages 1, 2, and 3 discuss the liability of individuals who send text messages to drivers while they are operating vehicles. Passage 1 highlights the growing concern about distracted driving and the increasing number of accidents caused by texting while driving. The passage notes that the American Automobile Association Foundation found that distracted driving-related incidents are difficult to track because most distracted drivers involved in wrecks don't report that they were using a cell phone at the time of the crash. Passage 2 presents a case where a driver was killed in a motorcycle accident caused by a text message sent by the driver's husband. The passage argues that the sender of the text message may be liable for the accident, citing a Pennsylvania court ruling that found the sender liable for the accident. Passage 3 discusses the Commercial Space Launch Act Amendments of 1988, which established the foundation for federal payment for claims resulting from commercial launch or reentry accidents. The passage notes that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) calculates separate MPL values for potential damages to third parties and the federal government. Passage 7 presents a New Jersey court case where a driver was killed in a motorcycle accident caused by a text message sent by the driver's friend. The passage holds that the sender of the text message is not liable for the accident, as there is no evidence that the sender knew the driver was driving at the time of the accident. The court concludes that the sender's liability is limited to the driver's own negligence, and that the sender did not have a duty to avoid sending the text message. The court's decision is based on the principle that a person sending a text message does not have a duty to avoid distracting a driver, as long as the sender is not physically present in the vehicle. The court's ruling is consistent with the majority opinion, which concludes that a remote texter has no liability for the accident. The concurring opinion, however, argues that traditional tort principles provide adequate guidance for determining liability in such circumstances. The court's decision is also influenced by the fact that the Legislature has not enacted legislation to impose civil liability or criminal penalties on remote texters. Overall, the passage highlights the challenges of holding individuals liable for accidents caused by distracted driving, and the need for clear legislation and guidelines to address this issue.", "answers": ["Court rulings in Pennsylvania and New Jersey are taking texting-while-driving laws down a new road, opening the door to not only holding the offending driver liable for a car accident, but perhaps also the person texting the driver, Consumerist reports. In neither case has anyone (yet) had to legally assume this burden: In the 2013 New Jersey appellate case, the \"remote texter\" was let off the hook because there wasn't enough evidence to show she knew her friend—who severely injured two people after slamming into their motorcycle—was driving when she texted him, the ABA Journal reports. And in the Pennsylvania case, the judge's ruling didn't hold responsible the two texters who were sending messages to the driver when she crashed into a motorcycle, killing that driver—it was simply determined the texters were fair game for the suit, per the Legal Intelligencer. But the fact that holding non-driving texters liable for car crashes is even being considered is starting to slowly impact the legal landscape on distracted driving. The New Jersey and Pennsylvania cases underscore the challenges in such cases. For instance, it's not enough to hold a texter liable simply because he or she texted a driver: Certain conditions must be met, such as knowing (or having good reason to believe) the driver would pick up the phone to check out texts while driving, as well as proving a \"special relationship\" exists between texter and recipient to influence the recipient picking up. But these kinds of cases, as well as other proposed crackdowns on car texters (including New York's controversial \"textalyzer\" bill), show the issue is being given heavier weight. \"People often see distracted driving as a socially acceptable sin … an innocuous guilty pleasure in which everyone indulges,\" a University of South Carolina law professor tells Vocativ. \"The same used to be true of drunk driving ... These legal developments could signal that a similar change in thinking is underway regarding distracted driving.\" (Jenny McCarthy's son called the cops for her texting-while-driving transgression.)"], "length": 56873}

The CRA requires federal banking regulators to conduct examinations to assess whether a bank is meeting local credit needs, and to award CRA credits to banks that engage in qualifying activities such as mortgage, consumer, and business lending, community investments, and low-cost services. However, the effectiveness of the CRA has been debated, with some arguing that it may induce banks to forgo more profitable lending opportunities in nontargeted neighborhoods, while others argue that it compels banks to make loans to higher-risk borrowers. Recent studies have shown that the CRA has led to increased lending to low- and moderate-income (LMI) areas, but the impact of the CRA on lending decisions is difficult to attribute to the CRA alone. The CRA has also been criticized for not providing clear guidelines on what constitutes a qualifying activity, and for not adequately addressing issues of discrimination and predatory lending. In response to these criticisms, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has proposed a new rule to modernize the CRA framework, which includes provisions for clearer standards for CRA-qualifying activities and increased flexibility in determining assessment areas.

The confirmation will mark the completion of NASA's tour of the \"classical nine\" planets, reports the AP, which notes that Pluto was considered a full-fledged planet instead of a dwarf one when the probe began its journey in 2006. Some things to know about the historic flyby, which comes 50 years to the day after the first successful flyby of Mars: New Horizons will have to capture a vast amount of data in a short time. The probe will be pushed to its limits as it pivots to capture photos and information on Pluto and its moons Charon, Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra during the flyby. \"I can't wait to get into the data and really start making sense of it.

We've already learned a lot of new things about Pluto. \"The science we've already made is mouth-watering,\" says Stern. \"The Pluto system is enchanting in its strangeness and its alien beauty.\" Among NASA's findings in recent days: Pluto's North Pole has an icy cap and the planet's diameter is 1,597 miles across, not 1,471 miles as previously thought. The finding suggests the planet contains a lot more ice and a lot less rock than thought, the Christian Science Monitor reports. There are still a lot of mysteries to be solved. Scientists hope the first close-up look at Pluto's surface will explain features like heart- and doughnut-shaped features recently spotted for the first time. LiveScience notes that new information from Pluto could help explain how our own planet formed and how life began. \"There's a feeling among scientists that Pluto probably will tell us what the early solar system looked like and it's now locked in deep freeze and maybe it will tell us what we once were, a long time ago,\" the director of the Deep Space Communication Complex tells Reuters.

{"pred": "Patti LuPone, a theater legend, was involved in a publicized incident where she snatched a cell phone from an audience member during a performance of her play \"Shows for Days.\" LuPone's actions were seen as a response to the growing issue of audience members using their phones during performances. The incident was part of a larger trend of cell phone disruptions in theaters, which has been a source of frustration for theatergoers and performers alike. The issue has been exacerbated by the increasing presence of tourists and young audiences who are more likely to use their phones during performances. In response to the problem, some theaters have implemented measures to discourage phone use, such as asking audience members to turn off their phones or providing a designated phone-free area. The incident with LuPone highlights the need for a more comprehensive approach to addressing the issue, including education and awareness campaigns to promote phone-free performances. The use of technology, such as mobile devices, has also been identified as a major contributor to the problem, and efforts to find ways to make phones less distracting and more convenient to use during performances are underway. The incident with LuPone serves as a reminder of the importance of maintaining a distraction-free environment for performers and audience members alike.\n\nIn addition to the theater issue, the selected passages also discuss the challenges of building a new class of oilers for the Navy, known as the John Lewis (TAO-205) class.

The brutal killings of Heather Aldrich, her sister Carrie Nelson, and Nelson's boyfriend Jody Hutchinson—all of whom were reportedly asphyxiated—and the discovery of their bodies in a burned-out SUV in the woods was linked back to Aldrich's relationship with Kenneth Brunke, who police and locals say was a gun-happy Manistique drug dealer, and his friend Garry Cordell, who tried to tell Brunke that Aldrich, the object of Brunke's affections, was using him for drugs. And Aldrich did steal a cocaine stash from Brunke's yard, which was followed by a text from Brunke ostensibly meant to lure Aldrich to come over for some free morphine. Aldrich headed to Brunke's house, along with Nelson and Hutchinson, which is where the story takes a weird turn. At first Cordell and his girlfriend, Marietta Carlson, confessed they and Brunke had killed the victims, though the stories kept changing; Brunke denied participating. But then, despite what looked to be certain convictions for all three, Carlson died while in custody, and Cordell suddenly dropped a bombshell: He and Carlson had committed all the murders themselves and Brunke hadn't been present (though he says Brunke did help set the car on fire with the victims' bodies in it). What some believe: Brunke may have paid off Cordell, an unemployed drifter, or promised to take care of Cordell's elderly mother if he took the blame. The cryptic statement Cordell offered in court when asked about a money exchange only fueled that suspicion: \"One man shall die so that the other may live.\" Cordell was sentenced to life in prison, per WLUC; Brunke will likely get five years or less for obstructing justice and lying to a cop when he's sentenced Jan. 21.

Brown and Batygin's research suggests that Planet Nine is a massive perturber that is influencing the orbits of these objects. The discovery was announced in the Astronomical Journal and is expected to be confirmed by further observations and detections of perturbed bodies.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes.

The device, which uses functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), detects patterns in brain activity to determine whether a patient is answering \"yes\" or \"no\" to questions. The study, led by Niels Birbaumer, involved four patients with completely locked-in syndrome (CLIS), who were able to communicate with doctors and family members using the device. The patients were able to answer questions about their quality of life, with all four indicating that they were \"happy\" with their lives. The study's findings suggest that CLIS may not be as debilitating as previously thought, and that the device could potentially be used to communicate with other patients with similar conditions. The researchers also believe that the device could be used to communicate with patients who are in a vegetative state, and that it could revolutionize the way we interact with people who are unable to communicate. The study's results have been published in the journal Plos Biology, and have sparked interest in the scientific community. The use of fNIRS to communicate with patients with CLIS has the potential to transform the lives of people who are unable to express themselves, and could lead to a greater understanding of the human brain and its capabilities.", "answers": ["Four paralyzed patients unable to communicate for years were finally able to do so through a potentially groundbreaking brain-reading system.

In other words, they had \"locked-in syndrome,\" meaning total motor paralysis in spite of normal cognitive and emotional processing. Researchers at the University of Tübingen in Germany fitted the patients with caps through which they could observe changes in blood flow in different parts of the brain, they explain in the journal PLOS Biology. They first asked the patients to think yes or no in response to simple statements such as their spouse's name, and moved on to more personal questions when that was mastered. “It’s the first sign that completely locked-in syndrome may be abolished forever, because with all of these patients, we can now ask them the most critical questions in life,” says researcher Niels Birbaumer. The patients, all of whom are on ventilators and being cared for at home, range in age from 24 to 76. The team did stumble on a couple surprises. For instance, all four patients suggested they were \"happy\" with their lives in spite of being locked-in. (Birmbaumer suggests this might be because of something akin to meditation.)

{"pred": "The US Supreme Court has ruled that a person who sends a text message to a driver who is texting and driving can be held liable for the driver's negligence. The ruling, which was made in the case of Gallatin v. Gargiulo, establishes that a person who sends a text message to a driver who is texting and driving can be held liable for the driver's negligence, even if they did not know that the driver was driving at the time. The court's decision is based on the principle that a person who sends a text message to a driver who is texting and driving can be considered to have \"aided and abetted\" the driver's negligence. This means that the person who sent the text message can be held liable for the driver's negligence, even if they did not know that the driver was driving at the time. The ruling is significant because it establishes a new standard for determining liability in cases involving distracted driving. The court's decision is also significant because it highlights the importance of taking steps to prevent distracted driving, including using technology to prevent texting while driving. The ruling is also notable because it sets a precedent for future cases involving distracted driving. The court's decision is likely to be appealed, and it will be interesting to see how the appeals court rules on the issue. In a related development, a new law has been proposed in New York that would allow police officers to use a device called a \"textalyzer\" to determine whether a driver was texting while driving. The textalyzer is a device that can detect whether a driver was texting while driving, and it can also provide information about the driver's location and speed. The law would also require drivers who are found to have been texting while driving to be charged with a misdemeanor. The proposed law is an effort to reduce distracted driving and to hold drivers accountable for their actions. The law is also an effort to provide police officers with a tool that can help them to enforce the law and to keep roads safe. The proposed law is likely to be debated in the state legislature, and it is unclear whether it will be passed. In another development, a study has found that texting while driving is a major cause of accidents and injuries. The study, which was conducted by the American Automobile Association Foundation, found that texting while driving is responsible for an estimated 3,200 deaths and 431,000 injuries each year. The study also found that texting while driving is a major cause of accidents and injuries, particularly among young drivers.

In neither case has anyone (yet) had to legally assume this burden: In the 2013 New Jersey appellate case, the \"remote texter\" was let off the hook because there wasn't enough evidence to show she knew her friend—who severely injured two people after slamming into their motorcycle—was driving when she texted him, the ABA Journal reports. And in the Pennsylvania case, the judge's ruling didn't hold responsible the two texters who were sending messages to the driver when she crashed into a motorcycle, killing that driver—it was simply determined the texters were fair game for the suit, per the Legal Intelligencer. But the fact that holding non-driving texters liable for car crashes is even being considered is starting to slowly impact the legal landscape on distracted driving. The New Jersey and Pennsylvania cases underscore the challenges in such cases. For instance, it's not enough to hold a texter liable simply because he or she texted a driver: Certain conditions must be met, such as knowing (or having good reason to believe) the driver would pick up the phone to check out texts while driving, as well as proving a \"special relationship\" exists between texter and recipient to influence the recipient picking up. But these kinds of cases, as well as other proposed crackdowns on car texters (including New York's controversial \"textalyzer\" bill), show the issue is being given heavier weight. \"People often see distracted driving as a socially acceptable sin … an innocuous guilty pleasure in which everyone indulges,\" a University of South Carolina law professor tells Vocativ. \"The same used to be true of drunk driving ...

It succeeds on both counts,\" writes Peter Howell more favorably at the Toronto Star. The film will undoubtedly offend a portion of the audience, but \"I enjoyed it because, unlike similar films of its ilk, everybody is in on the joke,\" he writes: white, black; rich, poor; etc. \"It's not great cinema, but it's also not just a scattershot of dumbness and vulgarity.\" And \"Ferrell and Hart make a good team.\" Cary Darling at DFW is less kind. \"Since anyone who has seen the trailer has already seen many of the film's best moments, making it through to the end does feel like something of a life sentence,\" she writes. Excepting a scene in which Hart portrays a black guy, a Latino guy, and a gay black guy within a matter of minutes, the film just doesn't bring the laughs. Instead, it's \"weighed down by middle-school jokes.\" At its best, Get Hard \"does a smartly scathing job\" of attacking privilege and entitlement, writes Ann Hornaday at the Washington Post. At its worst, it \"veers perilously close to committing the very sins it aspires to criticize.\" Particularly, \"the movie is drenched in gay panic\" and includes \"tiresome 'don't drop the soap' jokes,\" based on Ferrell's character's fears about being raped in prison.

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA) restricted the tax benefits of inversions, but subsequent regulations have limited the ability of corporations to access accumulated deferred earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 made significant changes to the corporate tax and international tax rules, including a new system for taxing foreign source income. The TCJA also adopted the Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse tax (BEAT) to address profit shifting between foreign parents and US subsidiaries. The US corporate tax rate has been lowered from 35% to 21%, but the benefit of a lower rate is negligible compared to the benefit of a territorial tax system.

He promised that \"democracy will win and it will survive\" as large numbers of demonstrators gathered in Tunis to protest the attack, reports Reuters. Meanwhile, ISIS militants today claimed responsibility for the attack, reports the BBC. But in a bright spot, two Spanish tourists who hid in the museum all night have now been found safe; Juan Carlos Sanchez tells the AP that \"we thought the terrorists were still outside. But it was simply the police who were searching for people.\" Cristina Rubio is four months pregnant; both are fine. In other developments: Prime Minister Habib Essi says one of the two gunmen, Yassine Laabidi, was known to authorities, but security services were unaware of links to militant groups, the BBC reports. Both gunmen were killed by security forces, and authorities say they're still hunting several accomplices. Tunisia has now detained a total of nine people. Officials say tourists from Japan, Italy, Colombia, Australia, France, Poland, and Spain were killed in the attack, according to the BBC. Poland, which has sent a plane with doctors to help treat the injured, says two of its citizens were killed, two are missing, and nine are among the 40 or so wounded, the AP reports. Tunisia, birthplace of the Arab Spring, is the \"Arab world's most successful democracy,\" which may have made it more of a target, but there are fears the attack could lead to greater authoritarianism, reports the New York Times. ISIS supporters are praising the attack online, as per the Times. The Telegraph reports that Tunisian media are speculating that Ahmed al-Rouissi, the country's most-wanted terrorist, may be involved. The Tunisian government says he became a senior ISIS leader in Libya and was killed in fighting last weekend. Tunisian officials have speculated that the adjacent Parliament building may have been the attackers' initial target, and that they may have switched to the museum because it had less security, the New York Times reports."], "length": 55682}

Eva Cuypers and her team at the University of Leuven separated the tissues and organs of six humans and 26 different animals, placing them in jars to decompose over the next six months. By collecting the gases building up in the jars, researchers identified 452 organic compounds, according to Science. Eight of those compounds were found only in decomposing humans and surprisingly human-like pigs, and five of them were unique to humans. These five compounds—called esters—were created by decomposing muscles, carbohydrates, and fat, Discovery reports. The esters create a \"singular chemical cocktail\" in decomposing humans and could explain why so-called cadaver dogs are able to sniff out dead people amid any number of competing smells, including other dead animals, Science reports. Cuypers and her team published their findings last week. They believe the results could be used to better train cadaver dogs or even create a machine that could do the same job. And Discovery points out the synthetic smell of decomposing human bodies could prove popular at Halloween parties. Experts have questioned components of the research—including the separation of tissue and organs—and Cuypers plans a follow-up study using full bodies buried in a field, Science reports. (The smell of corpses can also reveal when a person died.)"], "length": 54996}
{"pred": "The Chernobyl nuclear disaster, which occurred 30 years ago, had a profound impact on the environment and human health. The disaster led to the evacuation of the nearby city of Pripyat and the surrounding area, which remains largely uninhabitable due to high levels of radiation. The Ukrainian government is now seeking to develop solar power near the defunct Soviet reactors, with the goal of generating clean energy and reducing the country's reliance on fossil fuels. This initiative is seen as a way to promote economic development and improve public health in the region. The project has received interest from international investors, including two U.S. investment firms and four Canadian energy companies. The European Bank for Reconstruction & Development is also considering financing the project. The development of solar power at Chernobyl is seen as a way to promote Ukraine's integration into the European Union and to improve public opinion in conflict zones along the Russian border. The project is also expected to help Ukraine reduce its reliance on natural gas imported from Russia, which has been a major source of conflict in the region. Overall, the development of solar power at Chernobyl is seen as a way to promote economic development, improve public health, and reduce the country's reliance on fossil fuels.", "answers": ["If anything, the land in the 1,000-square-mile exclusion zone left largely untouched since the Chernobyl disaster of 1986 is cheap. After all, studies suggest it won't be inhabitable until the year 4986, reported McClatchy DC in April, and pretty much nothing can be harvested from it. But now Ostap Semerak, Ukraine's environment minister, is drumming up foreign interest in solar power projects across the wasteland, which he says is uniquely, if a bit ironically, suited to renewables, reports Bloomberg. PV Magazine reports that Igor Gramotkin, today the general director of the Chernobyl plant, in April pointed out that \"land and transmission line connection\" are the most expensive elements of a solar undertaking. Lucky then, that \"we already have high-voltage transmission lines that were previously used for the nuclear stations,\" says Semerak. \"And we have many people trained to work at power plants\" (thousands still work at Chernobyl). Plus there's all that inexpensive land. Ukraine's interest in renewables is partly politically motivated given the fragile cease-fire with Kremlin-backed rebels near the Russian border, not to mention increasing friction with the Putin camp over natural gas bills. Semerak says four energy companies from Canada and two investment firms from the US have expressed interest in a solar complex at the Chernobyl site, while Ukrainian developers intend to install panels there before 2016 is through.
