The analysis of his genome has shown that he had severe arteriosclerosis, a condition that is rare in hunter-gatherers. Additionally, Ötzi's genetic profile suggests that he was closely related to small populations in Sardinia and Corsica, and that he had brown eyes, brown hair, and type-O blood. Furthermore, Ötzi was the first known carrier of Lyme disease, a pathogen that has plagued humans for thousands of years. The study also found that Ötzi's teeth were heavily worn from chewing coarse grain and that he had a genetic predisposition to gum disease. The analysis of Ötzi's genome has provided valuable information about Neolithic life and has shed light on the health and well-being of ancient humans.

The expedition found 11 of the snakes, and DNA tests confirmed that the Clarion Island snake is a unique species, reports the BBC.

The National Emergencies Act of 1976 established a framework for the exercise of emergency powers, but it has been criticized for its lack of clarity and specificity. The Act allows the President to declare a national emergency, which can be used to activate various statutory provisions that grant the President additional authority. However, the Act also provides for congressional oversight and review of the President's actions. The Supreme Court has played a significant role in shaping the interpretation of emergency powers, with some justices arguing that the President's authority is limited by the Constitution and others arguing that it is more expansive. The concept of emergency powers is complex and multifaceted, and its exercise is subject to ongoing debate and controversy. In recent years, there have been several high-profile examples of the President's use of emergency powers, including the response to the 9/11 attacks and the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Public Safety Officers' Educational Assistance (PSOEA) program provides higher-education assistance to the children and spouses of public safety officers killed or permanently disabled in the line of duty. The PSOB and PSOEA benefit amounts are indexed to reflect changes in the cost of living. The PSOB program pays benefits if a public safety officer becomes permanently and totally disabled or dies \"as the direct and proximate result of a personal injury sustained in the line of duty.\" To qualify for coverage under the PSOB program, a public safety officer's disability or death must have been the result of a personal injury. The PSOB statute specifically provides for deaths caused by certain cardiovascular conditions. The death of a public safety officer due to a heart attack, stroke, or vascular rupture shall be presumed to be a death from a personal injury for the purposes of PSOB eligibility if the officer engaged in nonroutine stressful or strenuous physical activity as part of an emergency response or training exercise; and if the condition began during the physical activity, while the officer remained on duty after the physical activity, or within 24 hours of the physical activity. The PSOB program covers a public safety officer's death or disability if it occurred as the result of an injury incurred in the line of duty. The PSOB regulations provide that an injury occurs in the line of duty if it (1) is the result of the public safety officer's authorized activities while on duty, (2) occurs while responding to an emergency or request for assistance, or (3) occurs while commuting to or from duty in an authorized department or personal vehicle. In addition, if there is convincing evidence that the injury was the result of the individual's status as a public safety officer, that injury is covered by the PSOB program. The lump-sum PSOB death and disability benefit for FY2019 is $359,316. The benefit amount is adjusted annually to reflect changes in the cost of living using the annual percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Consumers (CPI-U) for the one-year period ending in the previous June.

Alan Shepard, the first American in space, had to hold his urine during his 15-minute suborbital flight, and later, Gus Grissom was given a makeshift urine collection system, which included a garter belt with a condom connected to a collection bag. Later, a proper urine collection system was developed, which included an external tube emptying into a bag with a one-way valve to prevent backflow. The Gemini program required a poop containment system as well, which was a harder challenge to solve. Astronauts used a foot-long tube-shaped bag with an adhesive lining to store their feces, which was analyzed after splashdown to determine how the body absorbs and digests nutrients without gravity. The Apollo spacecraft had a minimal amount of washroom privacy, and astronauts had to strip down completely naked while on the moon. To address the issue of using the bathroom in space, NASA developed a diaper for astronauts, which included a urine collection bag and a diaper. The diaper was not used by moonwalkers, but accidents still happened, and astronauts had to deal with the consequences. The development of washroom technology in space has yielded advances, and the shift to mixed-gender crews has made moderate privacy a necessity. The use of diapers in space is a unique and innovative solution to the problem of using the bathroom in space.

Seriously. The Houston Chronicle resurrects the fascinating historical tidbit by way of the Science Channel's Moon Machines documentary series, in which engineer Donald Rethke explained the very precise nature of early space diapers. The Maximum Absorbency Garment system, donned by Gemini and Apollo astronauts, featured one very specific element: a sleeve likened to a condom with a hole at the tip that enabled the men to urinate into a pouch with a one-way valve in their suits. Three sleeve sizes were available, small, medium, and large. And astronauts couldn't fib, explains Rethke. If they decided to order the next size up, the sheath wouldn't fit snugly, and liquid could potentially leak out, causing damage. To make the process a little less embarrassing, the sizes were later renamed: large, gigantic, and humongous. Motherboard notes that the urination issue was first brought to the fore by Alan Shepard, who spent hours in the Freedom 7 capsule in advance of a quick 15-minute \"suborbital hop.\" Denied permission to leave the capsule, he opted to pee in his suit—forcing Mission Control to turn off his biomedical sensors until the flow of oxygen in the suit dried the pee, allowing the sensors to be switched on.

The article is a fascinating oral history of the show's beginning that includes interviews with Stewart, Carell, Stephen Colbert, and pretty much everyone involved. The first year was rough for Stewart as he fought with the holdover writing staff from previous host Craig Kilborn and sought to put his stamp on the show. Things came together in that Carell interview, in which he peppers McCain with softball questions, then springs a policy zinger. After a few seconds of awkward silence, Carell says, \"I was just kidding! I don’t even know what that means!\" And the tense moment subsides. (See the clip.) Carell: \"It was making fun of a gotcha moment. And I think that a lot of what we do on The Daily Show is making fun of journalistic tropes, and I think that was one of them.\" Head writer Ben Karlin: \"I remember seeing it in the editing room. I remember Jon called me down, and seeing it and thinking, Yeah, this is what we should be doing. This is the goal. It was one of Carell’s most incredible moments. He asks McCain a question in a way that no journalists were talking to the candidates.

Turnout is everything: If it’s high, that’s probably a good sign for Romney. If it’s low, it’s a good sign for Paul and/or Santorum—depending on where it’s concentrated. Bad weather is thought to favor Paul’s band of enthusiastic supporters. Location, location, location: Romney’s support is strongest in eastern Iowa, Santorum should fare well in the northwest, and Paul is hoping for turnout in college towns such as Ames. Politico highlights 10 counties to watch here. The battle for fourth: If either Newt Gingrich or Rick Perry can pull out a closer-than-expected fourth, they might be able to stay in the race. Last-minute campaigning: Romney held rallies in four cities yesterday, his most since 2008. Paul held forth in a hotel full of journalists in Des Moines, hoping to grab media buzz. And Santorum appeared with the cast of 19 Kids and Counting, the TLC reality show beloved by Iowa homeschoolers. Some intriguing numbers: Paul’s favorability has fallen 21 points in the past week. Only 76% of Santorum’s supporters say they’ll definitely caucus for him.

The 35-year-old California man was sentenced to more than 21 years in prison Friday after pleading guilty to racketeering and conspiracy to distribute drugs, reports the Washington Post. His fall from grace is a wild tale: While at USC in 2004, Hanson began selling drugs, including cocaine and steroids, Rolling Stone previously reported. After college, he started working as a bookie in Los Angeles. Years later, his wife would tell a former boyfriend, professional gambler RJ Cipriani, that Hanson wanted to put up millions of dollars to fund his efforts at casinos in Australia, per 9 News. The money was to be returned with a casino check, though Cipriani could keep any winnings. Authorities say it was a scheme aimed at hiding money from Hanson's illegal dealings in Australia, where he could sell cocaine for ten times as much as in LA. Cipriani claims he figured this all out and was purposefully reckless at the casino tables to get out of the arrangement; he ended up losing $2.5 million. But his escape plan wasn't that easy. Cipriani says Hanson threatened him and his wife, including by sending them a video of two men being beheaded. \"If you don't pay us our money, this will happen to you,\" an attached note read, according to prosecutors. The US gambler eventually went to the FBI and Hanson was arrested in 2015 in a joint operation with Australian police. He pleaded guilty in January, and has now been ordered to forfeit $5 million in assets.

And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts—the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post—isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal.

A joint US-Mexico team, however, managed to rediscover the species found by American naturalist William Beebe in 1936 by using his original field notes to retrace his steps and search for the nocturnal snake, which blends in with the island's rock formations, the AP reports. The expedition found 11 of the snakes, and DNA tests confirmed that the Clarion Island snake is a unique species, reports the BBC. The snake is related to snakes found on part of the Mexican coast more than 500 miles away, and researchers believe its ancestors may have arrived on a tree trunk washed out to sea long ago. Beebe returned from a visit to the island, located 400-plus miles off Mexico's Pacific coast, nearly 80 years ago with a snake preserved in a jar, but his sample had long been considered a labeling error and his find was largely struck from taxonomic registries. The National Museum of Natural History praised the team's work, describing the snake as the \"only species ever to be discarded due to a presumed locality error.\" The rediscovery \"is an incredible story of how scientists rely on historical data and museum collections to solve modern-day mysteries about biodiversity in the world we live in,\" the museum said in a statement."], "length": 111158}

The story by Josh Meyer alleges that former President Obama gave up more than he acknowledged publicly, particularly in regard to a prisoner swap ahead of the deal. The Obama White House released seven prisoners it characterized as non-dangerous businessmen, neglecting to mention that three of them had been deemed a threat to national security by the president's own Justice Department. (They'd been accused of illegally shipping US macroelectronics to Tehran for use in surface-to-air and cruise missiles.) What's more, Politico found that the US also quietly dropped criminal cases against 14 fugitives, including Seyed Abolfazl Shahab Jamili, who allegedly procured thousands of parts with nuclear applications for Iran by way of China. \"They didn’t just dismiss a bunch of innocent business guys,\" one former federal law enforcement supervisor tells Politico. \"And then they didn’t give a full story of it.\" In fact, Meyer writes, the White House actions \"derailed\" its own successful investigations into Iran's proliferation network, angering Justice Department prosecutors. A senior Obama official acknowledges that anger but says such compromises are necessary and pale in comparison to the greater good of a nuclear deal. Here's one sample of early reaction, from the conservative Hot Air site: \"Barack Obama and John Kerry desperately needed a win on foreign policy in 2015-6 after seeing its 'smart power' approach turn the Middle East and Caucasus into flames,\" writes Ed Morrissey. \"They didn’t care if it was a short-term win that sacrificed long-term national security.\" Read the full Politico piece here."], "length": 110042}

Monson—who was ordained as a bishop at the age of 22 and became one of the church's apostles at 36—had led the church for almost a decade and largely remained behind the scenes during a tumultuous 10 years for the church, though he was well-known for helping the needy and often turned up unannounced at funerals or at the bedsides of the ill, reports the Salt Lake Tribune, which describes him as an \"affable leader\" and a \"folksy preacher.\" Monson, who was born in Salt Lake City and served in the Navy during World War II, was president of the church's Quorum of the Twelve Apostles for 13 years before becoming church leader. The AP reports that he's likely to be remembered for his humanitarian work, for lowering the minimum age for missionaries to 18 for men and 19 for women—and for leading his church's support of California's same-sex marriage ban in 2008. The Deseret News notes that Monson also, as chairman of the Missionary Executive Committee, assigned the first black Mormon missionary.

It's not clear what Trump meant in saying that the newspaper set up Corker, but the transcript makes clear that Corker knew he was on the record, notes CNN. He also knew the call was being recorded, telling the reporter that his staff was recording it, \"and I hope you are, too.\" GOP trouble: At the National Journal, political analyst Charlie Cook of the Cook Political Report writes that Trump went to a \"darker place\" in his Corker criticism, and he now thinks the GOP majority is in jeopardy not only in the Senate but in the House. \"The party needs to sublimate its divisions, get mainstream Republicans to the polls, and persuade the Trump base to cast ballot for non-Trump Republicans,\" he writes. \"That's a tall order.

The finding suggests the planet contains a lot more ice and a lot less rock than thought, the Christian Science Monitor reports. There are still a lot of mysteries to be solved. Scientists hope the first close-up look at Pluto's surface will explain features like heart- and doughnut-shaped features recently spotted for the first time.

FATCA requires certain taxpayers to report foreign financial accounts and other specified foreign financial assets to the IRS annually.

Sources tell the Wall Street Journal that the document was prepared by Christopher Steele, a former Russia expert in Britain's spy service who founded the Orbis Business Intelligence research firm in 2009. The New York Times, in a look at how the dossier came to light, reports that Steele was hired by Washington research firm Fusion GPS, which was hired by a wealthy GOP donor in the fall of 2015 to compile anti-Trump material. After Trump became the presumptive nominee, the GOP donor no longer needed the research firm's services, but wealthy Democratic donors stepped in, and Steele continued to send monthly memos detailing alleged Russian efforts to both compromise Trump and assist his campaign, per the Times' sources. In other coverage: The Guardian looks at John McCain's involvement, which apparently included clandestine efforts to obtain the dossier after hearing about it from a diplomat during a conference in Canada. \"Upon examination of the contents, and unable to make a judgment about their accuracy, I delivered the information to the director of the FBI,\" McCain said in a statement Wednesday. The AP reports that it has been unable to contact Steele. A neighbor of the former spy, who lives outside London, says Steele and his family are away and it's not clear when they will return. Intelligence chiefs are defending their decision to take the very unusual step of attaching a summary of the unverified dossier to last week's briefing on Russian hacking, the Washington Post reports. \"Part of our obligation is to ensure that policymakers are provided with the fullest possible picture of any matters that might affect national security,\" Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Wednesday. He said he spoke with Trump and expressed dismay at the \"extremely corrosive\" leaks in the press. Early Thursday, Trump tweeted that Clapper had called him \"to denounce the false and fictitious report that was illegally circulated.\" He added: \"Made up, phony facts.Too bad!\" Politico looks at how Democrats are dealing with Trump's Russia troubles. So far, senators have been more restrained than House members, some of whom have started referring to Trump as \"Moscow Donald.\" The New York Times reports that Trump is facing a backlash from Jewish groups for wondering if we \"are living in Nazi Germany\" when he was criticizing intelligence agencies' handling of what he called \"fake news.\" At the Intercept, Glenn Greenwald calls the dossier \"farcical\" and warns that this episode could backfire badly for Democratic operatives and others treating the dossier as gospel.

The train was traveling at a speed of 120 mph in a 50 mph zone, and the driver, Francisco Jose Garzon Amo, was under investigation for his role in the accident. The investigation found that the train was traveling too fast, and the driver had bragged about speeding on Facebook. The train was on its way to Santiago de Compostela, a popular pilgrimage destination, and the accident occurred on the eve of St. James' Day. The Spanish government declared three days of mourning, and the King and Queen visited the scene of the disaster. The derailment was one of Europe's worst rail accidents in recent years, and it raised concerns about the safety of high-speed trains in Spain. The investigation into the accident is ongoing, and the driver's role in the tragedy is still being investigated. The incident highlights the importance of safety measures and the need for stricter regulations to prevent such accidents in the future. The Spanish government has promised to take steps to improve the safety of its rail network, including increasing funding for safety measures and implementing new safety protocols. The incident has also raised questions about the role of technology in preventing accidents, and the need for more advanced safety systems to be implemented on high-speed trains. Overall, the Spanish train derailment is a tragic reminder of the importance of prioritizing safety in transportation and the need for continued investment in safety measures to prevent such accidents in the future.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's responsibilities as the nation's central bank fall into four main categories: monetary policy, provision of emergency liquidity through the lender of last resort function, supervision of certain types of banks and other financial firms for safety and soundness, and provision of payment system services to financial firms and the government. The Fed has defined stable prices as a longer-run goal of 2% inflation, and monetary policy can be used to stabilize business cycle fluctuations in the short run, while it mainly affects inflation in the long run. The Fed's conventional tool for monetary policy is to target the federal funds rate, which is the overnight, interbank lending rate. The Fed has used unconventional tools, such as quantitative easing, to provide additional monetary stimulus during times of economic stress.

Turns out we're not as special as we thought. A type of bat also displays this hemispheric specialization when it comes to sound processing, Washington has discovered. In both humans and Parnell's mustached bats—a species that lives in an area ranging from Mexico to Brazil, RedOrbit reports—the left hemisphere handles quicker sounds, while the right deals with slower ones, a press release reports. For humans, the right hemisphere \"may allow us to identify who is speaking, to gauge their emotional state via tone of voice, and to tease out pitch in music,\" Washington notes. As for the left hemisphere, \"men largely use just the left hemisphere\" to process language, while women use both hemispheres to do so, Washington says. In mustached bats—named based on the hair springing from the sides of their snouts, Animal Diversity Web explains—the right hemisphere's slower processing is used for sonar, \"which relies on detecting small changes in frequency,\" says Washington, senior author of the study in Frontiers in Neuroscience. The left is used \"to distinguish communication sounds from each other, because (the bats') communication sounds have rapid changes in frequency.\" All this is more than just a matter of interest: The findings could help study human language disorders, especially since some study techniques \"can only be permitted in animals,\" Washington adds.

Dr. Spitz's response argues that the suit should be dismissed with prejudice because his claims are merely \"speculation.\" The lawsuit arises from public discussion about theories involving one of the major unsolved crimes of the 20th Century. The Camera/9NEWS investigation found that DNA evidence in the case doesn't support the controversial decision by former District Attorney Mary Lacy to clear the girl's family members from all suspicion in her death. The investigation also found that DNA evidence in the case doesn't support the theory that Burke killed his younger sibling JonBenét. The investigation found that male DNA located in JonBenét's panties and in two spots on her long johns contained genetic material from at least two people in addition to the 6-year-old. The investigation also found that the genetic material in the long johns \"matched\" the DNA in the panties, but the experts disputed Lacy's conclusions that the genetic material belonged to the killer. The investigation found that Lacy was told of the results' ambiguities before she issued her controversial letter exonerating the Ramseys. The investigation also found that Lacy's approach showed signs of confirmation bias, an investigation tainted by a desire to reach a hoped-for result. The investigation found that Lacy established herself as a strong supporter of the theory that an intruder killed JonBenét, dating back to her time as a chief deputy in the district attorney's office immediately following the murder. The investigation found that Lacy's investigator Andy Horita wrote to the lab on March 12, 2008, that his bosses were \"very excited\" and \"pleased\" about the results that were being reported, and that \"we're happy with what has been done and don't see the need for additional testing\" unless strongly recommended by the lab. The investigation found that Lacy's approach was contrary to the spirit of \"double-blind\" standards to which such testing should adhere. The investigation found that Lacy's exoneration of the Ramseys was \"legally insignificant\" and \"has no meaning,\" largely due to the fact that the evidence she cited in her letter was never subjected to the rigorous scrutiny and cross-examination that all evidence in any case goes through in a courtroom.

A previous investigation by the two news outlets suggested that former District Attorney Mary Lacy erred when she exonerated members of the Ramsey family in 2008 based on her interpretation of earlier DNA tests. Lacy concluded that those tests revealed that an intruder killed the girl, but outside forensic experts have since disputed that, asserting that the DNA was a mishmash of multiple people and not that of the single person referred to as \"Unknown Male 1.\" \"If you're looking for someone that doesn't exist, because actually it's several people, it's a problem,\" explained a former US attorney for Colorado. The new, more sophisticated tests could provide an answer to which view is right. They could also reveal the DNA is worthless in terms of tracking down the killer, and merely the result of \"inconsequential contact with other people,\" per the Camera.

The author, Aran Khanna, created a Chrome extension that displayed users' locations on a map, highlighting the potential for misuse of this feature. The extension was downloaded over 85,000 times and sparked a significant public response, leading Facebook to change its default settings to require user permission to share geolocation data. Passage 8 explores the concept of privacy and data protection in the context of Facebook's geolocation feature. The author argues that the public's lack of awareness and concern about the collection and visibility of their geo-location data on Facebook Messenger is a significant issue. The study found that the extension was downloaded over 85,000 times, and more than 170 global news publications linked to the author's post.

A Harvard University junior lost his Facebook internship two hours before he had planned to travel to it after he exploited a privacy issue in the social network's Messenger system. Aran Khanna discussed his experience and findings in a paper published in Harvard's Technology Science journal. \"From 2011 to the start of this study in May 2015, Facebook Messenger collected and shared user geo-locations as the default setting for every message sent from the Android mobile app,\" he writes. The flaw was that those locations could be seen by anyone in a group chat, even if the person who sent the message wasn't friends with everyone else in the group. And so Khanna developed a browser app called Marauder's Map that exposed, on a map, the geo-location data that was being shared. He tweeted about his Chrome extension and posted about it on Medium on May 26. By the 28th, CNN, the Washington Post, and many others had covered his findings; the extension was downloaded 85,000 times. That same day, Facebook asked Khanna to disable the app; he did. The company also deactivated location sharing on desktops and released a June 4 update that required users to opt in to location sharing. It also withdrew Khanna's internship, which was to start on June 1. The official reason given was a violation of the \"high ethical standards expected of interns,\" according to Boston.com. \"This mapping tool scraped Facebook data in a way that violated our terms,\" a Facebook rep tells the site.

So suggests a National Institutes of Health study published Tuesday in the BMJ that found women who eat more potatoes before becoming pregnant may be more likely to develop gestational diabetes as compared to their spud-light counterparts. That finding stems from an analysis of 15,632 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study II over a 10-year period beginning in 1991. A press release explains the women had not previously had gestational diabetes, and at four-year intervals answered questions related to their diet in the year prior. Under the potato category, they were asked to rate their consumption of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes, fries, or potato chips on a scale of \"never\" to \"six or more times a day.\" The researchers begin their study by noting just how prevalent potato consumption is, with 35% of American women ages 19-50 eating potatoes daily, and the vegetable accounting for 8% of their caloric intake. Study author Dr. Cuilin Zhang recommends to CBS News that women cap it at one potato portion per week and consider a swap. The researchers estimate that trading two servings of potatoes weekly for a substitute vegetable, legumes, or whole-grain food would reduce the risk of gestational diabetes—which CBS reports affects as many as 8% of pregnancies—by 9% to 12%. As for why women should care, Zhang tells the BBC that women with gestational diabetes can develop pre-eclampsia and hypertension, which \"can adversely affect the fetus\" and put the mother at higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. The team notes, however, that the study shows correlation, not causation, and says more research is needed. (One country has told its women not to get pregnant right now.)"], "length": 109491}

The government has issued guidance documents that instruct schools regarding their responsibilities under Title IX when addressing allegations of sexual harassment. The proposed regulations would significantly alter the responsibilities of schools in responding to allegations of sexual harassment. The regulations would require schools to respond to allegations of sexual harassment only when they have \"actual knowledge\" of the harassment, and would impose new procedural requirements that reflect concern for due process when schools investigate allegations and make determinations of culpability. The regulations would also provide that a school's response to allegations of sexual harassment will violate the statute only if amounting to deliberate indifference. The regulations would require schools to investigate allegations received in a formal complaint, but if the alleged conduct would not (if proved) constitute sexual harassment under the regulations, or if it did not occur within a school's program or activity, the complaint must be dismissed. The regulations would also provide that schools must treat complainants and respondents equitably, which means that a school must both provide remedies for complainants upon a finding of sexual harassment as well as due process protections for a respondent before any sanctions are imposed. The regulations would also require schools to place the burden of proof and of gathering evidence on the school, rather than either party.

{"pred": " The passages discuss various topics, including the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP), the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), and the U.S. corporate income tax system. The SFSP is a program that provides free meals to children in low-income areas during the summer months. The program has faced challenges, including limited funding, transportation issues, and a lack of awareness among children and families. To address these challenges, FNS has taken steps to improve the program, including providing additional funding and promoting outreach efforts. The USDA's FNS is responsible for administering the SFSP and ensuring that state agencies comply with program requirements. The program has seen an increase in participation over the years, with a total of 149 million meals served in fiscal year 2016. However, the program's estimates of children's participation are unreliable due to variations in the number of operating days of meal sites and in the months with the greatest number of meals served. The program's data collection methods have also been criticized for being inconsistent. The U.S. corporate income tax system is complex and has been subject to changes in recent years. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 made significant changes to the corporate tax system, including a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. The TCJA also introduced new rules for foreign-source income, including a deemed repatriation rule and a base erosion and anti-abuse tax (BEAT). The law also restricted the benefits of inversions, which are corporate restructurings that allow companies to shift their headquarters to a lower-tax country. The TCJA aimed to reduce the incentive for inversions and prevent companies from shifting profits abroad. The law also introduced new rules for earnings stripping, which involves shifting income from a U.S. subsidiary to a foreign parent company. The TCJA aimed to prevent companies from using inversions to avoid paying taxes on foreign earnings.

The study gauged a remote player's skill by measuring such factors like kills and deaths. Researchers found men were typically cordial to players they believed to be male, and that more skilled men who kicked first-shooter butt were less likely to direct negative comments toward female-voiced players than their less skilled male counterparts. But lamer players tended to take their frustrations out on female players with more frequent, caustic comments. A lead author notes that gaming provides the perfect breeding ground for this kind of behavior: After all, the Post notes, players can remain anonymous, they may never run into an online teammate or opponent again, and it's a significantly male-biased recreation. Females threaten gamers' \"pre-existing social hierarchy\"; the guys at the bottom of the virtual totem pole feel threatened and therefore become more threatening to those they think they can quash the easiest. \"As men often rely on aggression to maintain their dominant social status, the increase in hostility towards a woman by lower-status males may be an attempt to disregard a female's performance and suppress her disturbance on the hierarchy to retain their social rank,\" the study notes.

The outcome of the hearing is uncertain, but Republicans are confident that Kavanaugh will be confirmed, given their control of the Senate. The confirmation process has been contentious, with Democrats accusing Republicans of trying to pack the court with a conservative judge. The hearing has also highlighted the deep divisions within the country, with many Americans expressing outrage and frustration with the political process. Overall, the confirmation hearing has been a dramatic and intense display of partisan politics, with the fate of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.\n\nThe unemployment insurance (UI) system has two primary objectives: providing temporary, partial wage replacement for involuntarily unemployed workers and stabilizing the economy during recessions. The joint federal-state Unemployment Compensation (UC) program provides benefits for eligible unemployed workers, with the federal government financing the program through the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) and state payroll taxes under each state's State Unemployment Tax Act (SUTA). The program is designed to provide up to 26 weeks of income support through regular UC benefit payments, with the possibility of extension for up to 13 weeks or 20 weeks under the Extended Benefit (EB) program. The Social Security Act of 1935 authorizes the joint federal-state UC program to provide unemployment benefits. Most states provide up to a maximum of 26 weeks of UC benefits, with former federal workers eligible for unemployment benefits through the Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees (UCFE) program.

However, independent scientists have studied the data and found that the halftime PSI measurements were consistent with the Ideal Gas Law, which explains the drop in pressure due to the cold weather.

The study includes data on 25 Spanish women scanned before and after their first pregnancies, along with 20 women who didn't get pregnant during the study. The brain changes in the pregnancy group emerged from comparisons of those two groups. The results were consistent: A computer program could tell which women had gotten pregnant just by looking at results of the MRI scans. And the changes, first documented an average of 10 weeks after giving birth, were mostly still present two years after childbirth. (Based on prior research findings, the researchers think the brain changes happened during pregnancy). No brain changes were seen in first-time fathers, reports the AP. What's going on?

In 11 places in the brain, the MRI data indicate reductions in volume of the brain's gray matter, but it's not clear what that means. For example, it could reflect a pruning of the places where brain cells communicate, called synapses. Losing some synapses is not necessarily a bad thing.

The Indian police arrested two brothers for allegedly kidnapping and raping a Japanese girl, who was held captive for 12 days. The DOD uses legislative authorities, such as the Laboratory Initiated Research Authority, to fund projects and initiatives that support its mission. The use of user fees is a common practice in the federal government, with fees collected into the Treasury General Fund or special fund accounts. User fees can be classified as discretionary or mandatory spending, depending on how they are authorized. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has analyzed the administration of various user fees and has set out principles for the design of those fees. The GAO has also noted that fees can tie benefits enjoyed by households or firms to payments that can help defray public costs of providing them, promoting fairness and efficiency. The use of user fees can also help decentralize decision-making by bypassing centralized allocation of resources. However, the flow of user fees and charges may reflect fluctuations in economic conditions, which can complicate the financing of government operations. The GAO has recommended that agencies review user fees every other year and that agencies seeking new authority to assess fees seek to remove restraints on user charges.

According to a recent report, Angelyne's real name is Ronia Tamar Goldberg, born in Poland in 1950 to Polish Jews who met in the Chmielnik ghetto during World War II. Her parents survived the war, but her mother died of cancer when Goldberg was 14. Goldberg immigrated to Israel with her family and later moved to Los Angeles, where she became a local celebrity for her billboard campaign and pink Corvette. Angelyne's rise to fame was fueled by her DIY approach, which included creating her own merchandise and appearing in various films and TV shows. Despite her fame, Angelyne has remained tight-lipped about her personal life, including her relationship status and origin story. Her enigmatic persona has captivated fans and inspired others to create their own personas. Angelyne's legacy extends beyond her celebrity status, as she has become a symbol of self-creation and self-marketing in the entertainment industry. Her influence can be seen in the rise of social media personalities and reality TV stars who have built their brands through similar means. Angelyne's story serves as a reminder that fame and success can be achieved through hard work, creativity, and a willingness to take risks. Her enduring appeal lies in her ability to reinvent herself and stay relevant in a rapidly changing world.

Passage 1 discusses the results of a study on the adoption of vegetarian diets, which found that 12% of the US population identifies as vegetarian or vegan, and that former vegetarians are more likely to lapse back into meat-eating due to social pressures and lack of support. Passage 9 discusses the author's personal experience of adopting a vegetarian diet, which was motivated by a desire to reduce their environmental impact and improve their health. The author notes that they struggled to maintain a vegetarian diet due to their dislike of vegetables and lack of support from their family. Passage 10 discusses the challenges of maintaining a vegetarian diet, which found that 84% of former vegetarians eventually revert back to eating meat, and that a slower approach to transitioning to a vegetarian diet may be more effective.

Passage 9 discusses how firms use various techniques to charge prices close to the highest price different consumers are willing to pay, and how consumers self-select into different groups according to their preferences and what they are willing to pay. Passage 12 examines the extent to which men and women may pay different prices in, or experience different levels of access to, markets for credit and goods and services that are not differentiated based on gender. The passages also explore the federal role in overseeing gender-related price differences, state and local efforts to address concerns about gender-related price differences, and the impact of laws and regulations on gender-based price differences. The key evidence presented includes data from the Nielsen Company, academic studies, and consumer complaints. The unique point made in Passage 9 is that firms may use group characteristics, such as age or gender, to charge different prices, and that consumers may not be aware of price differences due to differences in product characteristics and packaging. Passage 12 highlights the importance of considering the federal role in overseeing gender-related price differences, and the need for state and local laws and regulations to address concerns about gender-based price differences.

The U.S. and China's joint announcement is seen as a significant step towards a global climate agreement in 2015. The agreement is expected to encourage other countries to put forward their own ambitious emissions reduction targets. The U.S. and China's commitment to reducing emissions is also seen as a major breakthrough in the fight against climate change. The two countries' pledge is expected to have a significant impact on the global climate, and it is likely to influence the outcome of the climate negotiations in Paris. The agreement is also seen as a major step towards a more sustainable future, and it is expected to have a positive impact on the environment. Overall, the U.S. and China's joint announcement is a significant development in the fight against climate change, and it is likely to have a major impact on the global climate. \n\nIn the context of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) has finalized nine rules on overtime provisions for executive, administrative, and professional employees (EAP). The EAP exemptions are defined by Section 13(a)(1) of the FLSA, which authorizes the Secretary of Labor to define and delimit the terms \"executive,\" \"administrative,\" and \"professional\" employee. The EAP exemptions are intended to exempt employees who perform work that is not typically associated with hours of work per day, such as management, administrative, and professional work. The EAP exemptions are also intended to provide a level of compensation that is not available to nonexempt workers, such as above-average benefits and greater opportunities for advancement. The DOL has established three criteria for EAP exemptions: the salary basis test, the duties test, and the salary level test. The salary basis test requires that employees be paid a predetermined and fixed salary, the duties test requires that employees perform executive, administrative, or professional duties, and the salary level test requires that employees earn above a certain salary threshold. The EAP exemptions", "answers": ["The US and China rank as the world's two largest polluters, but a surprise deal is turning them into the world's two largest pollution fighters: The nations announced that they'll be working in tandem on long-term greenhouse-gas controls that would cut emissions by nearly a third over the next 15 years or so, CNN reports. \"As the world's two largest economies, energy consumers, and emitters of greenhouse gases, we have a special responsibility to lead the global effort against climate change,\" President Obama said in a joint press conference with Chinese President Xi Jinping today at the end of the APEC summit. The move, which was months in the making, came as a surprise to experts expecting a much more limited scope, the Wall Street Journal reports. Calling it a \"game changer,\" Mother Jones notes that it could heavily influence next year's climate talks in Paris. Key mandates include the US reducing emissions by 26% to 28% by the year 2025 (compared to the year 2005), as well as doubling the rate of emissions reduction each year between 2020 and 2025 to an average 2.3% to 2.8%, the AP reports. China is pledging to stop increasing emissions by 2030 (even earlier, if possible), as well as increase energy from zero-emission sources such as wind, solar, and nuclear to 20% by 2030. Although some worry about recent GOP gains in government as a possible roadblock, a senior administration official tells CNN that \"we believe we can proceed with the authority we already have.\" Secretary of State John Kerry writes in a New York Times op-ed that \"this is … a milestone in the United States-China relationship,\" a \"fresh beginning,\" and \"the first step toward a world that is more prosperous and more secure.\""], "length": 112361}
