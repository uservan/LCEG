Three sleeve sizes were available, small, medium, and large. And astronauts couldn't fib, explains Rethke. If they decided to order the next size up, the sheath wouldn't fit snugly, and liquid could potentially leak out, causing damage. To make the process a little less embarrassing, the sizes were later renamed: large, gigantic, and humongous.

Passage 1 explains that the practice was introduced by Joseph Smith in the early 1840s and was practiced by some Latter-day Saints until 1890. The passage highlights the challenges and difficulties faced by those who practiced plural marriage, including opposition from the outside world and internal conflicts within the Church. Passage 4 provides more background information on the practice of plural marriage, including its introduction in Nauvoo and the role of Joseph Smith in its practice. The passage also discusses the spiritual significance of plural marriage, including its connection to eternal marriage and the sealing of families together. Key evidence presented in Passage 4 includes the revelation on marriage, which was dictated by Joseph Smith in 1843, and the experiences of early Saints who practiced plural marriage. The passage concludes that the practice of plural marriage was a challenging but ultimately rewarding experience for many Saints, who were able to overcome their initial revulsion and find spiritual peace through their participation in the practice.

The essay explains that Smith was ordered to take multiple wives by an angel who visited him three times between 1834 and 1842; in the last instance, the angel was armed with a sword and threatened a reluctant Smith. The leader, then married to first wife Emma, took his first plural wife, Fanny Alger, in Kirtland, Ohio. Smith and Alger ultimately separated, and the church relocated to Nauvoo, Ill., where he married many more women. The oldest was 56, and the youngest was 14-year-old Helen Mar Kimball; some were already married, a revelation the New York Times describes as the \"biggest bombshell for some.\" The essay explains that a number of marriages, including that with Kimball, were sealed \"for eternity alone,\" suggesting sexual relations weren't involved (the ones that did involve sex were \"for time and eternity\"). What did Emma think of all this? Per the essay, she was none too pleased, though at one time she did accept four of Smith's wives into their home.

But no, then you also have to deal with the annoyances of pumping.\" Business Insider calls it \"one of the biggest issues for working mothers,\" and NBC News notes that half of all new mothers breastfeed for six months, meaning that most require pumps for at least parts of that stretch.

{"pred": " \nResearchers have successfully used a brain-computer interface (BCI) system to enable communication between patients with complete locked-in syndrome (CLIS), a condition where individuals are paralyzed but retain cognitive and emotional processing. The BCI system, which uses functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), allows patients to answer \"yes\" or \"no\" questions by detecting changes in brain activity. The study, led by Niels Birbaumer, involved four patients with CLIS who were able to communicate with the system using fNIRS. The results showed that the patients were able to answer questions with a high degree of accuracy, with some even indicating a positive attitude towards life. The study's findings have significant implications for patients with CLIS, who are often unable to communicate with the outside world. The researchers hope to build on this work to develop a system that allows patients to communicate more proactively, rather than simply answering questions. The study's success has also sparked interest in exploring the use of fNIRS technology for communicating with other brain-injured patients, including those in a vegetative state. Overall, the study demonstrates the potential of fNIRS technology to enable communication between individuals with severe paralysis and the outside world. \n\nAdditionally, a recent study published in the journal Plos Biology has shown that patients with locked-in syndrome may not be as unhappy as previously thought. The study, which involved four patients with CLIS, found that all of the patients reported being \"happy\" with life, despite being physically locked-in and unable to express themselves. The study's findings challenge the common assumption that patients with CLIS are miserable and unable to communicate with the outside world. The researchers suggest that patients with CLIS may be able to experience a sense of happiness and fulfillment, even if they are unable to express themselves. The study's results have significant implications for the care and support of patients with CLIS, and highlight the need for a more nuanced understanding of the condition.

And it turns out that one of them really didn't want his daughter to marry her boyfriend. The patients all had advanced ALS and were unable to control even their eyes, reports the Guardian. In other words, they had \"locked-in syndrome,\" meaning total motor paralysis in spite of normal cognitive and emotional processing. Researchers at the University of Tübingen in Germany fitted the patients with caps through which they could observe changes in blood flow in different parts of the brain, they explain in the journal PLOS Biology. They first asked the patients to think yes or no in response to simple statements such as their spouse's name, and moved on to more personal questions when that was mastered. “It’s the first sign that completely locked-in syndrome may be abolished forever, because with all of these patients, we can now ask them the most critical questions in life,” says researcher Niels Birbaumer. The patients, all of whom are on ventilators and being cared for at home, range in age from 24 to 76. The team did stumble on a couple surprises. For instance, all four patients suggested they were \"happy\" with their lives in spite of being locked-in. (Birmbaumer suggests this might be because of something akin to meditation.) And one patient, who is 61, answered \"no\" nine times out of 10 when his 26-year-old daughter asked if she should marry her boyfriend Mario. \"But they got married,\" one of the researchers tells the BBC. \"Nothing can come between love.\" (Researchers can't explain how Stephen Hawking has lived this long.)"], "length": 26818}

So far 11 of the quarantined have tested negative for Marburg, though they may be retested in a few days if the symptoms they've developed don't disappear.

The FBI says the other four devices found will be encased in blastproof material and taken to the agency's headquarters for further investigation, the New York Times reports. The devices—which were discovered by two men who found the backpack on top of a garbage can outside a restaurant near the Elizabeth station—will be closely examined for evidence linking them to explosive devices found in New York City and elsewhere in New Jersey over the weekend. A round-up of coverage: Elizabeth Mayor Christian Bollwage says the two men thought the backpack held something of value and carried it some distance before realizing it held explosive devices and calling police, NJ.com. He says in its original location near a pub, the devices could have caused carnage. \"If that pub was crowded and there was a lot of people there, it could have severely injured, killed and maimed many, many people,\" the mayor says. The AP reports that thousands of Amtrak and NJ Transit passengers were affected by the discovery of the device, with some stuck on trains for hours. Service has resumed but passengers in the area have been warned that they can expect delays Monday. NBC New York reports that investigators believe surveillance video shows the same man at two locations where explosive devices were found in Manhattan. Police aren't sure whether there is a link between the New York devices and those found in New Jersey. CNN reports that there is now an increased security presence in New York City not just because of the bombs, but because world leaders are gathering for the United Nations General Assembly. A law enforcement source tells CBS that investigators believe cell phones were used as triggers for both the Manhattan blast—which NY Gov. Andrew Cuomo calls \"obviously an act of terrorism\"—and the device that exploded before a New Jersey race to benefit Marines and sailors early Saturday. It's not clear whether a trigger was found with the Elizabeth devices. Bollwage says he's not sure his city was targeted. He suspects somebody may have just dumped the devices in Elizabeth, but he is \"extremely concerned for everyone in the state and country where someone can just go and drop a backpack into a garbage can that has multiple explosives in it with no timers and then you have to wonder how many people could have been hurt.\" An official close to the investigation tells Reuters that all the devices involved have been crude and the level of planning appears low—but some investigators fear this was just a test. \"That's what worries us,\" he says. \"Was this some kind of test run, not just of the devices, but also of the surveillance in New York and the response?\" (The FBI says it is questioning five people found in a \"vehicle of interest.\")"], "length": 25640}

He has also played a crucial role in neutralizing Christie, who had previously been in charge of the transition, and has worked to rally support from Jewish organizations to defend Trump's stance on Israel. Kushner's involvement in the campaign has been marked by controversy, with some critics questioning his loyalty to Trump and his role in the campaign's digital strategy. Despite these challenges, Kushner has emerged as a trusted advisor to Trump, with some observers suggesting that he may play a key role in moderating the president's more extreme tendencies.

The Ugandan Ministry of Health has tested 11 potential cases, including the victim's brother, and found them to be negative. However, if the symptoms persist, they will be re-tested. The disease is closely related to Ebola and has a high death rate, with some outbreaks having a fatality rate of up to 90%. Marburg hemorrhagic fever is spread through direct contact with the blood, tissues, or bodily fluids of an infected person or, in some cases, an infected primate or fruit bat. There is no cure for the disease, and treatment is mainly focused on supportive care. The Ugandan government has taken steps to control the outbreak, including quarantining the affected individuals and providing medical care to those who have come into contact with the victim. The government has also emphasized the need to improve equipment and funding for the military and to increase support for commercial farming.

According to a study on Halo 3, lower-skilled male players are more hostile towards female players, especially when performing poorly. This hostility is seen as an evolutionary response to the threat posed by female competitors, who can disrupt the male hierarchy and reduce the male player's status. In contrast, higher-skilled male players are more positive towards female players, as they have less to lose from a hierarchical reconfiguration. The study suggests that low-status males are more likely to engage in sexist behavior, and that this behavior is not driven by novelty or a preference for high-pitched voices.

The lake, which existed about 3.7 billion years ago, was likely a freshwater lake that was fed by streams and had a calm, still environment. The discovery was made by analyzing fine-grained sedimentary rocks called mudstones, which generally form in calm, still water. The mudstones contain clay minerals that formed in the sediments of the ancient lake, and the rover also spotted some of the key chemical ingredients for life in the samples, including sulfur, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and carbon. The discovery confirms and extends previous findings that a spot near the rover's landing site, Yellowknife Bay, was indeed habitable billions of years ago. The findings suggest that habitable environments were present on Mars more recently than previously thought, and the discovery of the ancient lake raises the possibility that life may have existed on Mars in the past.

{"pred": " \nThe concept of single-payer healthcare has gained significant traction among Democrats, with several prominent senators, including Bernie Sanders, supporting the idea. The Sanders plan, which aims to replace the current healthcare system with a government-run, single-payer program, has won over many liberal senators, including potential 2020 presidential candidates. However, not all Democrats are on board, with some expressing concerns about the cost and feasibility of the plan. The debate highlights the party's shift to the left, with many Democrats embracing more liberal policies, including Medicare for All. The idea has gained popularity, with 53% of Americans supporting a national healthcare plan, according to a recent poll. The party's focus on expanding access to healthcare, rather than just protecting the Affordable Care Act, reflects a broader shift in the Democratic Party's identity. The debate also highlights the challenges of implementing a single-payer system, including the need for significant tax increases and the potential for increased costs. Despite these challenges, many Democrats see the idea as a key benchmark for the party's future, and a potential solution to the country's healthcare woes. The Sanders plan has been endorsed by several prominent Democrats, including Senators Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, and Kamala Harris, and has sparked a national conversation about the future of healthcare in the United States. The debate reflects the party's growing willingness to take bold action on healthcare, and its commitment to expanding access to care for all Americans. The idea of Medicare for All has become a rallying cry for many Democrats, and is likely to remain a central issue in the party's 2020 presidential campaign. \n\nPassage 2:\nBernie Sanders has rolled out a new \"Medicare for All\" bill, which aims to replace the current healthcare system with a government-run, single-payer program. The bill has won over several prominent Democrats, including Senators Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, and Kamala Harris. The plan would eliminate private insurance companies and replace them with a government-run program, which would provide comprehensive coverage to all Americans. The bill has been endorsed by several liberal groups, including the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO). The plan would also reduce healthcare costs by eliminating the need for private insurance companies to make a profit. The bill has been met with skepticism by some Republicans, who argue that it would lead to increased taxes and a loss of private insurance options. However, many Democrats see the plan as a key step towards expanding access to healthcare for all Americans.\n\nPassage 3:\nThe Sanders", "answers": ["Bernie Sanders rolled out his vision to overhaul the health care system on Wednesday, one in which everybody would get their insurance from the government through Medicare instead of through their jobs or a private insurer. Sanders calls it the Medicare for All Act of 2017, but you'll also hear phrases such as \"single payer\" and \"universal health care\" used to describe it. One key part missing: details on how to pay for it, though Sanders plans to release a separate paper on that, reports the Wall Street Journal. Coverage: The basics: Per CNN, everybody gets a \"Universal Medicare card,\" which would be used to cover all health bills, from surgeries to dental care to substance abuse treatment. Co-payments would go away, and people would pay premiums based on their incomes, reports the AP. Private insurers would still exist, but for things such as elective plastic surgery or, sometimes, to act as middlemen between the government and hospitals or doctors. A 'right': Sanders makes his case in an op-ed in the New York Times. \"Guaranteeing health care as a right is important to the American people not just from a moral and financial perspective; it also happens to be what the majority of the American people want.\" 'Single payer': David Leonhardt of the New York Times has a Q&A on the fundamentals, including the basic question of what the term \"single payer\" means. In short, it \"describes a system in which only one entity—the government—pays medical bills. If all Americans had Medicare rather than insurance through their jobs, it would be a single-payer system.\" Vox says Sanders' system is far more generous than single-payer plans in Canada and elsewhere. The cost: This could cost hundreds of billions of dollars more per year, per the Journal. Details are yet to come, but Sanders envisions a progressive tax increase, with the wealthy paying more income, capital gains, and estate taxes, reports Newsweek. The senator says higher taxes for families would be offset by the fact that they no longer have to buy insurance. Still, in regard to single-payer systems, \"no one—including Sanders—has truly reckoned with how to pay for whatever system they might support,\" writes Mike Allen at Axios. Litmus test? By all accounts, the chances of it passing a GOP-controlled Congress are precisely 0%. But it's turning into a political litmus test of sorts for Democrats, reports the Washington Post. Sanders has the support of 15 Democratic senators so far, including all of those seen as potential 2020 presidential candidates. Co-sponsors include Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand, Cory Booker, and Kamala Harris. But many prominent Democrats are not on board, at least yet, including Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and those in tough re-election fights, reports Politico. The politics: No, this isn't going to pass, \"but here's the big question,\" writes Perry Bacon Jr. at FiveThirtyEight. \"Is it going to become one of the central goals of the Democratic Party and a defining feature of the campaign of whichever Democrat is the party's nominee in 2020?\" As of now, this \"seems very likely,\" as the Democratic party seems to be gravitating to the left. But Bacon lays out the political and policy reasons why Democrats might avoid \"becoming the party of single payer.\" Relishing the fight: Republicans see a chance to pounce. \"We welcome the Democrats' strategy of moving even further left,\" says Katie Martin, spokesperson for the Senate GOP's campaign organization, per the AP."], "length": 26165}

Scientists who conducted the study published in Plos One played 163 games of Halo as either male-voiced players or female-voiced players (82 female, 81 male) with remote teammates and opponents. The study gauged a remote player's skill by measuring such factors like kills and deaths. Researchers found men were typically cordial to players they believed to be male, and that more skilled men who kicked first-shooter butt were less likely to direct negative comments toward female-voiced players than their less skilled male counterparts. But lamer players tended to take their frustrations out on female players with more frequent, caustic comments. A lead author notes that gaming provides the perfect breeding ground for this kind of behavior: After all, the Post notes, players can remain anonymous, they may never run into an online teammate or opponent again, and it's a significantly male-biased recreation. Females threaten gamers' \"pre-existing social hierarchy\"; the guys at the bottom of the virtual totem pole feel threatened and therefore become more threatening to those they think they can quash the easiest. \"As men often rely on aggression to maintain their dominant social status, the increase in hostility towards a woman by lower-status males may be an attempt to disregard a female's performance and suppress her disturbance on the hierarchy to retain their social rank,\" the study notes.

The motive behind the killings was the theft of cocaine from Brunke, who was angry that Aldrich had stolen from him and was spurning his affection. The case was initially thought to be solid, with confessions from two of the suspects, but it took a dramatic turn when one of the suspects died in jail and a new confession emerged. The prosecutor, Tim Noble, was criticized for his handling of the case, particularly his decision to let Brunke plead to a lesser charge in exchange for his testimony against Cordell. The case highlights the growing drug problem in the Upper Peninsula and the devastating consequences of addiction. The investigation revealed a web of deceit and betrayal, with multiple suspects and motives, and the case remains a source of outrage and frustration for the victims' families.

And Aldrich did steal a cocaine stash from Brunke's yard, which was followed by a text from Brunke ostensibly meant to lure Aldrich to come over for some free morphine. Aldrich headed to Brunke's house, along with Nelson and Hutchinson, which is where the story takes a weird turn. At first Cordell and his girlfriend, Marietta Carlson, confessed they and Brunke had killed the victims, though the stories kept changing; Brunke denied participating. But then, despite what looked to be certain convictions for all three, Carlson died while in custody, and Cordell suddenly dropped a bombshell: He and Carlson had committed all the murders themselves and Brunke hadn't been present (though he says Brunke did help set the car on fire with the victims' bodies in it).

The finding suggests the planet contains a lot more ice and a lot less rock than thought, the Christian Science Monitor reports. There are still a lot of mysteries to be solved. Scientists hope the first close-up look at Pluto's surface will explain features like heart- and doughnut-shaped features recently spotted for the first time.

The casino industry has been accused of knowingly designing slot machines to be addictive, with some machines featuring \"near misses\" that give players the illusion of winning. The National Center for Responsible Gaming estimates that 1.1 to 1.6 percent of the adult population in the United States has a gambling disorder, and that another 2 to 3 percent of adults may have some form of addiction. The industry has also been accused of targeting problem gamblers and exploiting their addiction for profit. The case of Scott Stevens highlights the devastating consequences of gambling addiction and the need for greater regulation of the industry. The use of virtual reel mapping technology in slot machines has been criticized for its potential to deceive players and create a false sense of winning. The industry's focus on the \"addicted gambler\" as a key customer has been criticized for its role in perpetuating addiction. The National Council on Problem Gambling estimates that one in five gambling addicts attempts suicide, and that the industry's focus on the \"whale\" customer has contributed to the problem.

Scott Stevens was a successful Ohio finance exec whose life started unraveling in 2006 after a trade show in Vegas. For six years, his gambling habit spiraled out of control: He sneaked off to gamble when his wife thought he was working, embezzled nearly $4 million from his firm, and drained his family's savings—until the day in 2012 he decided to end his life. After his suicide, Stacy started researching gambling addiction (she hadn't even known about her husband's problem) and filed suit against the West Virginia casino where he was a regular, as well as the maker of the slot machines there. Experts relay how casinos track and target addicted gamblers, supply ready flows of cash via on-site ATMs, and offer plenty of perks to keep them coming back. But it's the modern-day slot machines themselves, with deceptive technology called virtual reel mapping, that seem to be designed to lull gamblers into a trance—or what the industry refers to as \"continuous gaming productivity\"—so they don't stop playing. While the casinos and machine manufacturers place the blame for gambling addictions on individuals, Terry Noffsinger, the lead attorney for the Stevens suit, says these addictive machines are not due to \"negligence.

As with most debates on climate change—particularly when talking about a single weather event—the views are all over the map. And some are suggesting that we need to frame the question differently to get the most accurate response. The details: Wrong question: Did climate change cause Harvey? That's not the right question, writes Dino Grandoni at the Washington Post. \"The better way to frame thinking about the connection is through the question: Does climate change make storms like Harvey more likely?\" This is a theme repeated in multiple posts on the subject, and Grandoni thinks the answer is yes, for reasons spelled out below. 'Worsened': One of the most cited pieces is from Penn State professor Michael Mann in the Guardian. \"We can't say that Hurricane Harvey was caused by climate change,\" he writes. \"But it was certainly worsened by it.\" The three big factors: Higher ocean levels made the storm surge worse, warmer water made the storm more intense, and Harvey stayed \"locked in place\" thanks to atmospheric changes brought on by humans. (The latter was the subject of a paper by Mann.) Maybe 'slightly': University of Washington atmospheric scientist Cliff Mass is skeptical the link is that strong. \"You really can't pin global warming on something this extreme,\" he tells Fox News. \"It has to be natural variability. It may juice it up slightly but not create this phenomenal anomaly.\" Link is 'unknown': Texas State climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon thinks it's too early to assess any link. \"The climate change impact on the strength of Harvey is unknown,\" he writes to CNN. \"Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the strongest storms, but it's not clear whether Harvey was in that category.\" Still, he notes that heavier rain in general is a \"direct consequence\" of climate change, and Harvey certainly fits that pattern. Too 'fussy': David Leonhardt at the New York Times thinks \"it's time to shed some of the fussy over-precision about the relationship between climate change and weather.\" The evidence is overwhelming that human-caused climate change results in storms such as Harvey, he writes, and our timidness in admitting it is holding up solutions. All about the rain: The jury is out on whether climate change increases the frequency of hurricanes, writes David Roberts in a wide-ranging Q&A at Vox. But he, too, says it's clear that heavier rain is an undisputed consequence. \"In fact, due to sea level rise and more moisture in the air, I expect flooding to be the most frequent public face of climate change over the next decade or so.\" Media coverage: You won't hear much about climate change in the current news coverage because reporters don't want to \"politicize\" the situation, writes Naomi Klein at the Intercept. \"But here's the thing: Every time we act as if an unprecedented weather event is hitting us out of the blue, as some sort of Act of God that no one foresaw, reporters are making a highly political decision,\" she notes.

Blocking or pulling back on regulations will be another priority of the Congress, per USA Today, with a bill expected that would give the GOP-controlled Congress approval power over any new federal regulations, as well as a \"Midnight Rules Act\" that would give Congress sway to nullify in bulk any rules passed during a president's final year in office.

A joint investigation by the Boulder Daily Camera and 9News calls into question former District Attorney Mary Lacy's decision to exonerate the Ramsey family. At the time, Lacy concluded that DNA evidence found on JonBenet's underwear and long johns belonged to a male intruder who was not part of the Ramsey family. But now three forensic experts who examined the DNA test results and lab reports used by Lacy say they do not support her conclusion. For one thing, a sample on her underwear identified as coming from \"Unknown Male 1\" may in fact be a composite from multiple people and thus \"worthless as evidence,\" says the news report. Another revelation that further muddles the picture: DNA samples on her long johns appear to come from JonBenet and at least two other people, not one, a fact that has never been revealed before. What's more, the independent experts say all of the unknown DNA may be the result of \"inconsequential contact with other people,\" reports the Camera. With the exoneration, \"I was trying to prevent a horrible travesty of justice,\" Lacy tells ABC. (The interview was done before these latest revelations.) \"I was scared to death that despite the fact that there was no evidence, no psychopathy, and no motive, the case was a train going down the track and the Ramseys were tied to that track.\" Comparison to the DNA profile now in doubt was used to exonerate dozens of other potential suspects.

{"pred": " Jared Kushner, a senior adviser to President Donald Trump, has released a statement denying any collusion with Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign. The statement, which Kushner released to the Senate Intelligence Committee, claims that he had no improper contacts with Russia and did not collude with Moscow. The statement also denies that Kushner's father-in-law, Trump, received any help from Russia to win the election. Kushner's statement comes after reports that he had met with Russian officials, including Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and a Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, during the campaign. The statement has been met with skepticism by some, who point to inconsistencies in Kushner's account of the meetings and the lack of evidence to support his claims. The statement has also raised questions about Kushner's role in the Trump campaign and his potential involvement in any wrongdoing. The Senate Intelligence Committee has been investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election and potential ties to the Trump campaign. Kushner's statement is seen as a key development in the investigation, and his testimony is expected to be closely watched. The statement has also sparked a debate about the role of foreign interference in elections and the need for greater transparency and accountability in the campaign finance system. Overall, Kushner's statement has highlighted the complexity and controversy surrounding the Trump campaign and the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.", "answers": ["With the first of his two days of congressional testimony in the books, Jared Kushner made a rare public statement Monday afternoon to reaffirm his main point: \"I did not collude with Russia, nor do I know of anyone else in the campaign who did so,\" he said, per the AP. Kushner spoke outside the White House after meeting behind closed doors with the Senate Intelligence Committee. While he largely reiterated points made earlier in an 11-page statement to Congress, Kushner also suggested that the Russia investigation has political undertones. \"Donald Trump had a better message and ran a smarter campaign, and that is why he won,\" he said, per NBC News. \"Suggesting otherwise ridicules those who voted for him.\" Kushner has said all of his actions related to four meetings with Russian nationals were aboveboard, per CNN. He added during his speech that he had \"no improper contacts\" and has \"not relied on Russian funds for my businesses.\" Kushner is back on Capitol Hill Tuesday, when he again testifies behind closed doors, this time with the House Intelligence Committee.

{"pred": " \nThe Pacific sardine fishery, a crucial component of the West Coast ecosystem, is facing a severe population decline. The fishery's collapse has significant implications for the region's marine biodiversity, with many species of seabirds, whales, sharks, dolphins, and commercially important fish such as salmon and tuna relying on sardines as a primary food source. The Pacific Fishery Management Council should take two key actions to address this issue: setting conservative catch limits on sardines when the population is low and prohibiting unregulated fishing on forage fish species such as sand lance, saury, and lanternfish. The decline of forage fish populations is a pressing concern, with populations fluctuating widely and being highly dependent on the upwelling of cold nutrient-rich waters to stimulate the growth of phytoplankton, their primary food source. The Pacific sardine fishery's collapse is a classic example of the impact of overfishing and climate change on marine ecosystems, with the fishery's population declining by over 75% since its peak in 2000. The value of forage fish to the global economy is significant, with the industry worth an estimated $11.3 billion annually, and the loss of these species could have far-reaching consequences for the entire ecosystem. The Pacific Fishery Management Council's actions could help mitigate the effects of this decline and ensure the long-term sustainability of the West Coast ecosystem.", "answers": ["The West Coast sardine population was down 72% since 2006 per a fall assessment—the worst crash since the mid-20th century, and one with far-reaching implications, particularly since the steep decline is expected to continue. One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing. Last month, Pew Charitable Trusts warned that dozens of species, including whales, sharks, dolphins, salmon, and tuna, could feel an impact."], "length": 25655}
