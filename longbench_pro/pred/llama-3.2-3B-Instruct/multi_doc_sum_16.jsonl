A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) found that approximately 30% of all outpatient oral antibiotic prescriptions written in the United States are inappropriate. The study, conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), analyzed data from the 2010-2011 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. The researchers estimated that 353 of the 506 antibiotic prescriptions written annually per 1,000 population were appropriate. The study also found that sinusitis, ear infections, and pharyngitis were the most common diagnoses associated with antibiotic prescriptions. The CDC's findings suggest that curbing antibiotic overprescribing is a major public health priority, as it contributes to drug resistance and has serious consequences, including 2 million individuals infected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria each year and 23,000 deaths annually. The study's results support the need for antibiotic stewardship programs and education for healthcare providers to promote responsible antibiotic use. Additionally, the CDC's 5-year National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria aims to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use in outpatient settings by 50% by 2020, and the study's findings suggest that a 15% reduction in overall antibiotic use would be necessary to meet this goal. Furthermore, the study highlights the importance of pharmacist education and patient counseling to prevent unnecessary antibiotic use and promote responsible antibiotic use.

And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts—the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post—isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them. The Times notes President Obama's initiative to cut down on unnecessary outpatient antibiotic use by 50% by 2020; researchers say that, based on this study, we'll need to slash overall antibiotic use by 15% to meet that. \"If we continue down the road of inappropriate use we'll lose the most powerful tool we have to fight life-threatening infections,\" CDC Director Tom Frieden says. \"Losing these antibiotics would undermine our ability to treat patients with deadly infections [and] cancer, provide organ transplants, and save victims of burns and trauma.\" (Here's hoping teixobactin can help us out with superbugs.)"], "length": 13484}

Here's what some of the experts are saying: Slash Film argues you can't blame Spielberg for the failure, as he's far from the first director to flop when adapting a story by Roald Dahl. In fact, only one film based on a Dahl book—Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory—has made more than $34 million in US theaters. The Wrap has a list of seven reasons The BFG bombed, from \"Roald Dahl is no JK Rowling\" to a lack of stars and a confusing title. The BFG might be proof it's time for Spielberg to step away from family films, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which points out the director hasn't had a hit family film since Hook a quarter of a century ago. He's had better luck with recent grown-up fare like Lincoln and Bridge of Spies. The Wall Street Journal details Spielberg's history of being able to \"bounce back\" after cinematic disappointments, something he should have a good chance of doing with his next three films currently including a historical drama, a science-fiction movie based on a popular book, and an Indiana Jones sequel. But the \"reason this stings\" is because every other time Spielberg disappointed at the box office, it was with a \"good for you\" film, according to Forbes.

The boy's dad smelled a rat. He accused Davis of disqualifying his son's team so the second- and third-place teams, which bowl at lanes owned by Davis, could take higher honors. Davis fired back that Powell was \"full aware of the dress code\" and sent his kid anyway. He pressed: \"What parent would do this?\" As the Guardian reports, one of Powell's complaints is that his son was disqualified only after bowling a 171-point game that propelled his Riverdale team to the title in the Newfoundland city of St. John's.\" After the story made headlines in Canada, an odd-sounding compromise was reached. The disqualification stands, but the kids get their gold medals. In the future, however, all rules must be followed \"no matter what,\" wrote Davis on Facebook.

The shift is attributed to the changing business model of the industry, with studios focusing on high-grossing films that can generate significant revenue through merchandising, TV spin-offs, and theme park attractions. The decline of mid-budget films has led to a decrease in the number of independent filmmakers and the loss of unique storytelling voices.

The rise of television as an alternative to filmmaking has also been noted, with many filmmakers turning to TV to find work and creative fulfillment.

Overall, the decline of mid-budget films has had a significant impact on the film industry, leading to a loss of creative diversity and a shift towards a more commercialized and homogenized industry. \n\nKey evidence: \nThe decline of mid-budget films, the rise of big-budget blockbusters, the changing business model of the industry, the emphasis on high-grossing films, the decline of independent filmmakers, the loss of unique storytelling voices, the homogenization of content, the impact on the careers of filmmakers, the rise of television as an alternative to filmmaking.\n\nUnique or innovative points: \nThe idea that the film industry is shifting towards a more commercialized and homogenized industry, the concept of \"theme park rides\" as a metaphor for the homogenization of content, the observation that the decline of mid-budget films has led to a decrease in the number of independent filmmakers and the loss of unique storytelling voices. \n\nKey figures: \nNone mentioned in the summary, but notable figures mentioned in the passages include David Lynch, John Waters, Steven Soderbergh, Francis Ford Coppola, Matthew Weiner, Sherry Lansing, Ted Hope, Susan Seidelman, Cary Fukunaga, Jodie Foster, Joel Schumacher, James Foley, Carl Franklin, Jeffrey Katzenberg, and Dorothy at Forbes. \n\nNote: The summary is based on the selected passages (Passage 2 and Passage 3) and focuses on the main arguments", "answers": ["Wonder what happened to iconic film directors like David Lynch, John Waters, and Francis Ford Coppola? Well, Hollywood checked the balance sheet and decided to stop making their kind of mid-budget films, Flavorwire reports. It's all dollars and cents: Thoughtful or offbeat films costing $5 million to $60 million can make moderate profits at best, while blockbusters with international appeal are able to bring in sick money. Paramount's Titanic made that point in 1997 by costing $200 million and earning nearly $2.2 billion worldwide. At that time, mid-budget films like Kiss the Girls and In & Out dominated the Paramount slate and drew modest profits; this year, mega-flicks like Transformers: Age of Extinction, Hercules, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles rule Paramount's roost and earn the big bucks. \"You could make movies in the ten-to-twenty-million-dollar budget range\" at one time, says Susan Seidelman, director of Desperately Seeking Susan. Now, she says, studios \"have to appeal to every demographic in every part of the world.\" And few seasoned directors want to test the indie market, where tons of under-$2 million films are vying for attention. So Spike Lee has funded a film via Kickstarter, Steven Soderbergh publicly quit feature filmmaking last year, and other directors are turning to TV for creative freedom. This sea-change has been coming for years now, as an old Forbes piece shows, but some—including Steven Spielberg—believe Hollywood will over-invest in blockbusters: \"There’s going to be an implosion\" where several \"mega-budgeted movies are going to go crashing into the ground, and that’s going to change the paradigm again,\" he says."], "length": 13521}

According to NASA's calculations, its New Horizons spacecraft flew by Pluto at 31,000mph at 7:49am EDT today; confirmation of that will come tonight, some 13 hours later, reports the AP. The confirmation will mark the completion of NASA's tour of the \"classical nine\" planets, reports the AP, which notes that Pluto was considered a full-fledged planet instead of a dwarf one when the probe began its journey in 2006. Some things to know about the historic flyby, which comes 50 years to the day after the first successful flyby of Mars: New Horizons will have to capture a vast amount of data in a short time. The probe will be pushed to its limits as it pivots to capture photos and information on Pluto and its moons Charon, Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra during the flyby. \"I can't wait to get into the data and really start making sense of it. Right now, we're just standing under the waterfall and enjoying it,\" principal New Horizons scientist Alan Stern tells the BBC. We don't know whether it was a success. The probe is far too busy to \"phone home,\" the AP notes, but it's expected to send a confirmation signal at around 9pm tonight. The eagerly awaited first photos from the flyby should be released tomorrow night, the Guardian reports, though it will take 16 months to send all the data from the flyby back to Earth. We've already learned a lot of new things about Pluto. \"The science we've already made is mouth-watering,\" says Stern. \"The Pluto system is enchanting in its strangeness and its alien beauty.\" Among NASA's findings in recent days: Pluto's North Pole has an icy cap and the planet's diameter is 1,597 miles across, not 1,471 miles as previously thought. The finding suggests the planet contains a lot more ice and a lot less rock than thought, the Christian Science Monitor reports. There are still a lot of mysteries to be solved. Scientists hope the first close-up look at Pluto's surface will explain features like heart- and doughnut-shaped features recently spotted for the first time. LiveScience notes that new information from Pluto could help explain how our own planet formed and how life began. \"There's a feeling among scientists that Pluto probably will tell us what the early solar system looked like and it's now locked in deep freeze and maybe it will tell us what we once were, a long time ago,\" the director of the Deep Space Communication Complex tells Reuters. The Australian facility will be first to receive new information from the spacecraft. New Horizons isn't done.

The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route. As Krakauer writes, the \"wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion\" that broke free and caused last week's avalanche came from \"that same ice bulge\" and killed 16 Sherpas. As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60. Among the reasons it's gotten safer: Climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen, and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet, which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain).

The agency has also recommended that VA medical centers require documentation of all reviews of providers' clinical care after concerns have been raised, and establish a timeliness requirement for initiating such reviews. These recommendations aim to improve the quality of care provided by VA medical centers and ensure that providers are held accountable for their actions.\n\nThe storm's impact has also highlighted the importance of climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts.

{"pred": " \nA new study by Pecan Street Research Institute suggests that solar panels facing west can generate more electricity than those facing south, particularly during peak demand hours. The study found that west-facing panels produced 2% more electricity in a day and reduced grid dependence during peak hours by 65% compared to south-facing panels. This challenges the conventional wisdom that solar panels should always face south to maximize energy production. The study's findings have implications for the solar industry, utility companies, and homeowners, who may be able to optimize their solar panel orientation to reduce their energy consumption and reliance on the grid. The research also highlights the importance of testing solar panel performance in practice, rather than relying solely on theoretical assumptions. Additionally, the study's results suggest that west-facing panels may be more effective in regions with high solar irradiance, such as the southern United States.

Passage 1 discusses the fatality rate of ethnic Sherpas working on Everest, which is 1,332 deaths between 2000 and 2010, compared to 25 deaths per 100,000 full-time equivalents in the mining industry. The author notes that the fatality rate has been rising since 2010, and the Nepali government's response to the crisis is inadequate. Passage 2 highlights the overcrowding and unstable weather conditions on Everest, which have led to a series of accidents and fatalities. The author argues that the growing popularity of the mountain has outpaced the ability of the Nepali government to manage the risks, resulting in a \"human traffic jam\" on the mountain. Passage 4 provides a personal account of the 2012 avalanche on Everest, which killed 16 Nepali Sherpas and highlighted the risks faced by Sherpas. The author notes that the Sherpas' wages are inadequate, and they are forced to take on excessive risks to make a living. The author also highlights the Sherpas' demands for better compensation and working conditions, which have been met with resistance from the Nepali government. Overall, the passages suggest that the risks faced by Sherpas on Everest are unacceptable and that improved safety measures and better working conditions are needed to protect their lives and livelihoods.

His piece makes plain the imbalance between the dangers faced by Sherpas and the climbers they shepherd to the mountain's peak, but before arriving at that point, he shares a fascinating backstory: That of Himex, a New Zealand-based company that Krakauer calls the most \"lucrative commercial guiding operation\" on Everest—one that on May 7, 2012, packed up shop after 18 years on the mountain and headed home, taking its guides, members (aka paying climbers, who didn't see their $60,000 refunded), and Sherpas with them. The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route. As Krakauer writes, the \"wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion\" that broke free and caused last week's avalanche came from \"that same ice bulge\" and killed 16 Sherpas. As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60. Among the reasons it's gotten safer: Climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen, and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet, which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain).

The referendum is a result of tough negotiations with creditors, and EU leaders have warned that a \"No\" vote could lead to Greece leaving the eurozone. The Greek economy is already being squeezed, with banks closed and limits imposed on cash withdrawals. A recent IMF report has highlighted the need for Greece to receive an additional €50bn euros over the next three years to stabilize its finances. The negotiations have centered on debt relief, with Tsipras calling for a 30% \"haircut\" off the debt and a 20-year grace period for the rest. The outcome of the referendum is uncertain, but it is clear that the fate of Greece's economy and its relationship with the eurozone hangs in the balance. The European Commission, the European Union's executive arm, has been pushing for Athens to raise taxes and slash welfare spending to meet its debt obligations. The referendum is seen as a test of the country's commitment to the eurozone and its ability to implement the necessary reforms. The outcome of the referendum will have significant implications for the European economy and the future of the eurozone. \n\nPassage 3:\nThe Greek debt crisis is a complex issue, and a recent primer by Anil Kashyap of the University of Chicago Booth School of Business provides a clear overview of the situation. The crisis began in the mid-1990s, when Greece's constant spending exceeded its tax revenues, leading to a significant increase in debt. The IMF and European governments provided bailouts to Greece, but the country's economy continued to struggle. The IMF's analysis of Greece's debt burden was flawed, and the country's debt was not sustainable. The ECB's decision to allow banks to use Greek debt as collateral created conditions that supported the trading of Greek debt, making it difficult for Greece to pay its debts. The Greek government's request for debt relief is seen as a necessary step to avoid default, but the creditors are hesitant to provide it due to concerns about precedent and the potential impact on other European countries. The ECB's decision to limit its support for Greece has further exacerbated the crisis, and the country's economy is now facing a severe recession. The outcome of the referendum will determine the fate of Greece's economy and its relationship with the eurozone.\n\nPassage 4:\nThe Greek debt crisis is a complex issue, and the recent developments", "answers": ["Greece's top court has declared that Sunday's referendum on a bailout is constitutional, meaning the vote with huge implications for all of Europe will proceed.

The Chicago Police Department (CPD) reported that at least 41 people were shot, with five fatalities, between midnight and 10 a.m. Sunday. The shootings were largely attributed to gang conflicts, with police citing the need for community cooperation to reduce gun violence. The CPD has been working to target illegal guns and gangs, and has seen a decline in homicides and shootings since implementing this strategy. However, the recent surge in violence has raised concerns about the effectiveness of this approach. Mayor Rahm Emanuel has emphasized the need for job creation and economic development on the South and West Sides, while Police Chief Fred Waller has called for community cooperation to address the issue. The CPD has also faced criticism for its handling of the situation, with some arguing that the department is not doing enough to address the root causes of the violence. The recent surge in violence has also led to a renewed focus on the need for gun control measures, with some calling for stricter laws to reduce the availability of firearms.

{"pred": " Playboy Magazine to Stop Publishing Fully Nude Female Photography\n\nPlayboy magazine, a iconic men's publication, is set to drop fully nude female photography from its pages. The decision, made by the magazine's US owners, is attributed to the internet revolution and the ubiquity of online pornography. According to Playboy's chief executive Scott Flanders, \"You're now one click away from every sex act imaginable for free. It's just passé at this juncture.\" The magazine's circulation has dropped significantly since its peak in the 1970s, and the decision to cover up nude photos is seen as an attempt to appeal to a broader and younger audience. The change will take effect in February, and the magazine will continue to feature women in provocative poses. The move is also seen as a response to the changing attitudes towards nudity and the rise of alternative publications like Vice. While some have praised the decision as a bold move, others have expressed concern that it may alienate the magazine's long-time subscriber base. The removal of nude photos may also boost the magazine's articles, which have long been a key feature of the publication. Overall, the decision to drop fully nude female photography from Playboy's pages is a significant shift in the magazine's approach to content and is likely to have implications for the wider media industry.", "answers": ["Playboy magazine has decided it no longer makes sense to try to compete with an Internet full of photos of naked women.

Flanders tells the Times that the target audience will be young, urban men. \"The difference between us and Vice is that we're going after the guy with a job,\" he quips. The Playboy company now makes most of its money from licensing its brand, and Flanders tells the Times that the magazine loses around $3 million a year in the US, which is a cost the firm sees as an expense for their \"Fifth Avenue storefront.\" The Times notes that the Playboy website became SFW and got rid of nudes last year, which execs say caused traffic to quadruple to 16 million users a month.

However, the trip is also marred by controversy, including Trump's decision to share classified intelligence with Russian officials and his reluctance to condemn extremist ideologies.

The proposal—titled \"America First: A Budget Blueprint to Make America Great Again\"—contains cuts that the Washington Post says could be the biggest reduction in federal programs since the post-World War II drawdown. The Environmental Protection Agency and the State Department are the hardest-hit agencies according to budget previews, with cuts of around 30%. Military spending would be beefed up by $54 billion under the proposal, $1.5 billion is earmarked for a border wall, and Homeland Security would get a 6.8% funding increase. A roundup of coverage about the $1.15 trillion spending plan: The document is here. Politico reports that the budget is \"red meat\" for Trump's base, with deep cuts to their most disliked government agencies and programs, though it is also what's known as a \"skinny budget\" because it is so short on details. A more detailed budget will be out in May. The AP lists winners and losers. The latter group includes the departments of Energy, Labor, and Transportation, along with after-school programs and many independent agencies supported by tax dollars. White House budget director Mick Mulvaney acknowledged that the cuts would lead to job losses, Reuters reports. \"You can’t drain the swamp and leave all the people in it,\" he said during a budget preview Wednesday. He said that White House officials had looked at Trump's campaign speeches, and \"turned those policies into numbers.\" The New York Times reports that congressional Republicans have already declared parts of the plan dead on arrival. \"The administration’s budget isn’t going to be the budget,\" Sen. Marco Rubio told reporters. \"We do the budget here. The administration makes recommendations, but Congress does budgets.\" The Hill notes that such proposals tend to be \"little more than guidance\" for lawmakers—and that the Senate shot down Obama's 2015 budget 98 to 1. The AP reports that the budget funds Trump's boost for the Pentagon, the biggest since Ronald Reagan's, with cuts to conservative targets including the National Endowment for the Arts, legal aid for the poor, and the AmeriCorps national service program. NBC notes that Trump's proposal, which makes cuts to 12 out of 15 Cabinet agencies, only covers the \"discretionary\" quarter of the $4 trillion budget for the fiscal year that starts in October. The portion dealing with issues including taxation, Social Security, and Medicare is due in mid-May.

Rosenwald's philanthropic efforts, which included building over 5,000 schools for African-American children in the rural South, were motivated by his desire to help bridge the racial divide in America. Through his work with the Rosenwald Fund, Rosenwald supported prominent African-American artists, including Langston Hughes, Marion Anderson, and Jacob Lawrence, and helped to foster a sense of community and cultural identity among African-American communities. Rosenwald's legacy continues to inspire new generations of philanthropists and civil rights activists, who see his commitment to social justice and education as a powerful model for their own work.

Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal.

His decision to exit the race comes after a promising start, during which he was seen as a front-runner in Iowa and a darling of both the conservative base and powerful donors.

Doug Ford's campaign focused on populist planks, including tax cuts, reducing gasoline taxes, and lowering the floor price of beer. His message resonated with voters, particularly in rural areas, and he was able to capitalize on the NDP's lack of appeal to some voters. The election was also notable for the controversy surrounding Rob Ford, Doug's brother, who was involved in a scandal and died of cancer in 2016. Despite the challenges, Doug Ford's campaign was successful, and he is now poised to become the premier of Ontario. The election results suggest that the province is looking for a change, and Doug Ford's message of tax cuts and reduced government spending is likely to be a key factor in his success. The NDP's strong showing in different pockets of the province highlights the complexity of the election and the need for a more nuanced understanding of the voters' concerns.

The review, which is the largest post-conviction review ever done by the FBI, will include cases conducted by all FBI Laboratory hair and fiber examiners since at least 1985. The review comes after The Washington Post reported in April that Justice Department officials had known for years that flawed forensic work might have led to the convictions of potentially innocent people but had not performed a thorough review of the cases.

The FBI has acknowledged that nearly every examiner in an elite FBI forensic unit gave flawed testimony in almost all trials in which they offered evidence against criminal defendants over more than a two-decade period before 2000. The review is also expected to include notification of defendants and their attorneys, a departure from previous one-sided government reviews that left defendants in the dark. The review is seen as a significant step towards addressing the issue of flawed forensic evidence and ensuring the scientific validity and accuracy of the forensic science used in the US criminal justice system.

He suspects somebody may have just dumped the devices in Elizabeth, but he is \"extremely concerned for everyone in the state and country where someone can just go and drop a backpack into a garbage can that has multiple explosives in it with no timers and then you have to wonder how many people could have been hurt.\" An official close to the investigation tells Reuters that all the devices involved have been crude and the level of planning appears low—but some investigators fear this was just a test. \"That's what worries us,\" he says. \"Was this some kind of test run, not just of the devices, but also of the surveillance in New York and the response?\" (The FBI says it is questioning five people found in a \"vehicle of interest.\")"], "length": 13278}

The floods have already inundated parts of Germany, Austria, and Slovakia, killing at least 15 people. The European Commission's emergency response center has declared a state of emergency in Hungary, and thousands of volunteers have been working to reinforce the banks of the swelling river. The floods are expected to peak near the border with Slovakia and in Budapest on Monday. Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orban, has warned that the country's defenses may not be able to withstand the rising waters, and up to 55,000 people may need to be evacuated. The swollen Elbe River in eastern Germany is also threatening the state of Saxony-Anhalt, where thousands of people are being evacuated from their homes. The floods are attributed to heavy rain in the region last weekend, which left the ground saturated. The European Commission's emergency response center has reported that the floods are causing widespread damage and disruption, with the cost of damage expected to run into hundreds of millions of euros. The floods have also raised concerns about the safety of a toxic waste reservoir in Hungary, which could be contaminated by the rising waters. Environmental campaign group Greenpeace has raised concerns about the potential for water pollution, and the Hungarian government has been working to mitigate the risks. The floods have also highlighted the need for improved communication and governance between emergency responders and the public, with some critics arguing that the response has been slow and inadequate.

Duncan—who will also face criminal charges if he pulls through—has no health insurance, and it's not clear if the bill will ever be paid. \"It's too early to make a decision about payment of bills; he is in critical condition,\" a Liberian Embassy spokesman says. \"The focus is on his health.\" More: Duncan, 42, is receiving an experimental drug, and health officials say there have been a few positive signs: He's still on dialysis, but his blood pressure and temperature are now normal, reports the New York Times. None of the 48 people under observation who came into contact with him are showing Ebola symptoms. But with the incubation deadline days away, Dallas is on edge, reports the AP. \"This is a very critical week,\" says Texas Health Commissioner David Lakey. \"We're at a very sensitive period when a contact could develop symptoms. We're monitoring with extreme vigilance.\" Before he became unresponsive, Duncan apologized to his fiancee and told her he would have \"preferred to stay in Liberia and died than bring this to you,\" a family friend tells the Washington Post.
