And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts—the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post—isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them. The Times notes President Obama's initiative to cut down on unnecessary outpatient antibiotic use by 50% by 2020; researchers say that, based on this study, we'll need to slash overall antibiotic use by 15% to meet that. \"If we continue down the road of inappropriate use we'll lose the most powerful tool we have to fight life-threatening infections,\" CDC Director Tom Frieden says. \"Losing these antibiotics would undermine our ability to treat patients with deadly infections [and] cancer, provide organ transplants, and save victims of burns and trauma.\" (Here's hoping teixobactin can help us out with superbugs.)"], "length": 16236}

This brings the absolute risk up to 1 in 10, reveals new UCL research funded by the Medical Research Council. The researchers studied 3,432 UK university staff and students aged 18-40 who had been bereaved, to examine the specific impacts associated with bereavement by suicide. As well as the increased risk of suicide attempt, those bereaved by suicide were also 80 percent more likely to drop out of education or work. In total, 8 percent of the people bereaved by suicide had dropped out of an educational course or a job since the death. Our results highlight the profound impact that suicide might have on friends and family members, says study author Dr Alexandra Pitman (UCL Psychiatry). However, these outcomes are by no means inevitable. If you have been bereaved by suicide, you should know that are not alone and support is available. There is a guide called Help is at Hand, written by people affected by suicide, which offers emotional and practical advice as well as information on organisations that can offer further support. We know that people can find it difficult to know what to say to someone who has recently been bereaved. However, saying something is often better than saying nothing, and simple gestures like offering practical help with day-to-day activities can mean a lot. For example, when a colleague bereaved by suicide returns to work after compassionate leave then it could be helpful to ask how they are and offer to help them with their workload. Employers should be aware of the significant impact that suicide bereavement has on people's working lives and make adjustments to help their staff return to work. The study also found that people who had been bereaved by suicide tended to perceive more social stigma around the death. When the results were adjusted for perceived social stigma to reflect this, the significant differences in suicide attempts and occupational functioning disappeared. While further research is required, this suggests that addressing the social stigma attached to suicide bereavement might be one way to help to limit its impact on people's lives.

They found that individuals whose deceased loved ones had killed themselves were 65% more likely to attempt suicide themselves (what NDTV refers to as the phenomenon of \"suicide contagion\") than those affected by a loved one's sudden death by natural causes—or 1 in 10 people in that segment, per a press release.

And the social stigma around suicide may be a significant factor affecting a mourning person's outlook. \"Suicide in particular is often perceived as a taboo subject,\" Pitman notes. \"Avoiding the subject can make a bereaved person feel very isolated and stigmatized, and sometimes even blamed for the death.\" That's not to say, though, that having such a tragedy afflict a family member or close friend dooms a person to a similar sad fate. \"These outcomes are by no means inevitable,\" Pitman says. \"If you have been bereaved by suicide, you should know that are not alone and support is available.\" (A Marine unit has lost 14 members to suicide.)"], "length": 15151}

The $140 million fantasy film, based on a Roald Dahl book, will earn around $22 million over the July 4th holiday. Which means, with the caveat that July 4th rarely falls on a Monday and that most big Independence Day releases don't open on a Friday, that the film is looking at a domestic total of around $55-$65m. Maybe it'll leg it and do more, but it's counting on overseas figures to save it. The reason this stings isn't because \"Spielberg has lost his touch\" or any such thing. But rather because, not only is The BFG a rare Spielberg flop, it is the first such film in a long time (if ever) that was intended primarily as a commercial venture. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Most people will argue that the star-studded and critically-trashed 1941 was Steven Spielberg's first box office disaster.

That's left people wondering if the man who essentially invented the summer blockbuster with Jaws has lost his summertime feeling. Here's what some of the experts are saying: Slash Film argues you can't blame Spielberg for the failure, as he's far from the first director to flop when adapting a story by Roald Dahl. In fact, only one film based on a Dahl book—Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory—has made more than $34 million in US theaters. The Wrap has a list of seven reasons The BFG bombed, from \"Roald Dahl is no JK Rowling\" to a lack of stars and a confusing title. The BFG might be proof it's time for Spielberg to step away from family films, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which points out the director hasn't had a hit family film since Hook a quarter of a century ago. He's had better luck with recent grown-up fare like Lincoln and Bridge of Spies. The Wall Street Journal details Spielberg's history of being able to \"bounce back\" after cinematic disappointments, something he should have a good chance of doing with his next three films currently including a historical drama, a science-fiction movie based on a popular book, and an Indiana Jones sequel. But the \"reason this stings\" is because every other time Spielberg disappointed at the box office, it was with a \"good for you\" film, according to Forbes.

{"pred": "\nPassage 1:\nCongressional rules establish a general division of responsibility under which questions of policy are kept separate from questions of funding. Broadly, the term authorization is used to describe legislation that establishes, continues, or modifies the organization or activities of a federal entity or program. By itself, such legislation does not provide funding for such purposes. Instead, the authority to obligate payments from the Treasury is left to separate appropriations measures. This distinction between appropriations and general legislation as two separate classes of measures, and their consideration in separate legislative vehicles, is a construct of congressional rules and practices. It has been developed and formalized by the House and Senate pursuant to the constitutional authority for each chamber to \"determine the Rules of its Proceedings.\" This power permits each chamber of Congress to enforce, modify, waive, repeal, or ignore its rules as it sees fit. Because the two chambers exercise this rulemaking authority independently, they have developed differing (albeit generally similar) rules and practices. This report addresses solely developments in the House. According to Hinds' Precedents , the origin of a formal rule mandating the separation of general legislation from appropriations can be traced to 1835, when the House debated the increasing problem of delay in enacting appropriations due to the inclusion of \"debatable matters of another character, new laws which created long debates in both Houses\" and suggested that the Committee on Ways and Means should \"strip the appropriation bills of every thing but were legitimate matters of appropriation.\" In the following Congress (25 th Congress, 1837-1839), language was added to House rules that stated: No appropriation shall be reported in such general appropriation bills, or be in order as an amendment thereto, for any expenditure not previously authorized by law. This rule was applied broadly on occasion to exclude legislative provisions authorizing new expenditures as well, such as a case in 1838 when it was used to exclude an amendment that included a provision for refurnishing the White House. Gradually, the rule \"became construed through a long line of decisions to admit amendments increasing salaries but as excluding amendments providing for decreases", "answers": ["President Trump slammed the \"disgraceful\" verdict Thursday after a Mexican citizen was found not guilty of murder in the 2015 shooting death of Kate Steinle at a San Francisco pier. \"No wonder the people of our Country are so angry with Illegal Immigration,\" Trump tweeted Thursday night, and he kept up his criticism Friday morning. \"BUILD THE WALL!\" he wrote.

On the right, she is being accused of abusing her power while in office to \"unmask,\" for political advantage, the names of Trump associates caught up in intelligence surveillance. Trump critics, meanwhile, say the story doesn't amount to much and accuse the White House of trying to divert attention from the president's wiretapping allegations. A look at coverage: A key story comes from Eli Lake at Bloomberg News. He reported Monday that Rice requested the identities of Trump transition officials who were mentioned, but not named, in US intelligence reports. Those reports were mostly summaries of monitored conversations between foreign officials talking about the Trump transition, but sometimes between Trump associates and foreign officials. (The National Security Council logs of Rice's requests are apparently what Rep. Devin Nunes went to the White House to view.) Lake's piece raises questions about why Rice wanted those names revealed—she didn't respond to the story—but he also notes that her requests \"were likely within the law.\" He adds that the story doesn't \"vindicate\" Trump's unsupported accusation that Obama wiretapped Trump Tower. Adam Housley of Fox News also reported on Rice's requests, and his appearance on the network prompted Trump himself to weigh in via tweet: \"Such amazing reporting on unmasking and the crooked scheme against us by @foxandfriends. 'Spied on before nomination.' The real story.\" A post at Slate notes that Trump associates are under FBI investigation over allegedly improper communications with Russians, \"so there may well have been urgent, legal reasons for Rice to have wanted information about the relationships between specific Trump-related figures and foreign individuals.\" But the editorial page at the Wall Street Journal accuses the media and Democrats of hypocrisy. It wants any Trump-Russia ties investigated, but complains that the \"media have been running like wildebeest after that story while ignoring how the Obama Administration might have abused domestic surveillance for its political purposes. Americans deserve to know the truth about both.\" On CNN, Don Lemon accused the \"right-wing media\" of helping the White House try to divert attention from the controversy over Trump's wiretapping claims, adding that his show will not \"aid and abet people who are trying to misinform you, the American people, by creating a diversion,\" he said, per Mediaite. The conservative NewsBusters blog accused ABC, NBC, and CBS of covering up the story by failing to report on the \"massive revelation\" Monday in their evening broadcasts. On MSNBC Tuesday morning, frequent Trump critic Joe Scarborough blasted the New York Times for not having the story on its front page. \"What is Susan Rice unmasking names for and spreading them across the government,\" he asked on Morning Joe, per Mediaite. But the Times story on the subject (inside the paper) generally downplayed the significance of Rice's requests: \"Former national security officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, described the requests as normal and said they were justified by the need for the president’s top security adviser to understand the context of reports sent to her by the nation’s intelligence agencies.\""], "length": 16581}

{"pred": "\nPassage 1:\nRequirements for military awards and decorations can change over time. New events and changes in military, political, or social conditions can generate debate over who is eligible for various military awards. These changes tend to be controversial, especially with veterans groups. Congress has considered several pieces of legislation that would change who would be eligible to receive the Purple Heart, and under what conditions. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have greatly increased the number of servicemembers receiving the Purple Heart award as well as the potential conditions under which they receive the award. Increasingly acknowledged conditions, such as traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as well as accidents and other events while deployed, bring up new questions as to when a servicemember deserves a Purple Heart. The July 17, 2015, shooting of servicemembers at a Marine recruiting office and a naval reserve center in Chattanooga, TN, again prompted questions about applying the Purple Heart to terrorist attacks versus criminal acts. Veterans groups often voice their views when Congress or the President proposes making changes to expand eligibility for the Purple Heart. These groups argue, for example, that a servicemember who acquires PTSD may not always deserve the same recognition as a servicemember killed or wounded in direct combat, while others contend that these medical conditions can debilitate servicemembers just as much as physical injuries and can have lasting effects on servicemembers' lives. Determining which actions and events make a servicemember qualified for receiving a Purple Heart, and whether expanding eligibility does a disservice to those who have already earned the award, are contentious elements of this debate. Although Congress has traditionally left many military award requirements to the executive branch, the Constitution does allow Congress to act in this area, and events have prompted changes regarding eligibility for the Purple Heart.

Paramount's Titanic made that point in 1997 by costing $200 million and earning nearly $2.2 billion worldwide. At that time, mid-budget films like Kiss the Girls and In & Out dominated the Paramount slate and drew modest profits; this year, mega-flicks like Transformers: Age of Extinction, Hercules, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles rule Paramount's roost and earn the big bucks. \"You could make movies in the ten-to-twenty-million-dollar budget range\" at one time, says Susan Seidelman, director of Desperately Seeking Susan.

The finding suggests the planet contains a lot more ice and a lot less rock than thought, the Christian Science Monitor reports. There are still a lot of mysteries to be solved. Scientists hope the first close-up look at Pluto's surface will explain features like heart- and doughnut-shaped features recently spotted for the first time. LiveScience notes that new information from Pluto could help explain how our own planet formed and how life began. \"There's a feeling among scientists that Pluto probably will tell us what the early solar system looked like and it's now locked in deep freeze and maybe it will tell us what we once were, a long time ago,\" the director of the Deep Space Communication Complex tells Reuters.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Billboards towered over the city's palm trees and wide-lane highways showing a blonde, buxom woman, generally clad in pink and often reclining on a red corvette. Sometimes they displayed all of her, sometimes just her heavily powdered face, sometimes just her bust, straining against a lacy bra. Near these photos was a phone number, the word \"management\" in small print, and a signature in looping cursive: Angelyne. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As NPR put it, she was the self-described \"blonde bombshell billboard princess.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But that was a pseudonym. Everyone knew what she looked like, but no one knew who she was. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Until this week, when journalist Gary Baum, reporting with a mixture of public documents and family testimony, published a report in the Hollywood Reporter claiming to have unearthed her true identity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Angelyne's birth name is Ronia Tamar Goldberg, later Americanized to Renee Tami Goldberg, according to Baum, who said she was born in Poland in 1950 to Polish Jews who met in the Chmielnik ghetto during World War II and later settled in Los Angeles. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Angelyne's spokesman, Scott Henning, denied the accuracy of Baum's report, telling him: \"This stuff comes up every few years — it seems to get more and more ridiculous. My favorite one of all was this 300-pound black woman who claimed to be her mother. 'I'm your long-lost brother,' 'your twin sister.' Chalk it up to life in Hollywood. I've never heard of 'Rene", "answers": ["About a year after Hollywood Reporter journalist Gary Baum profiled Angelyne, the mysterious billboard bombshell he describes as LA's \"modern myth,\" a hobbyist genealogist contacted him claiming to have proof of a compelling back story: that she was born in Poland to Holocaust survivors. Now, also for the Hollywood Reporter, Baum unravels what he believes is likely the iconic blonde's true identity, publishing yearbook photos, marriage certificates, and more. The woman who's adorned hundreds of billboards across LA since the 1980s under the one-name pseudonym Angelyne—she's been called a precursor to other \"famous for being famous\" celebrities like Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian—appears to have started off as Ronia Tamar Goldberg. She came to California in 1959 by way of Israel, and her mother died of cancer at the age of 44 when Goldberg, who upon arrival to LA became Renee, was just 14. Baum reached out to Goldberg's alleged younger sister, now Annette Block, and her husband, as well as an ex-husband and a stepsister, all of whom are generally hazy on details if willing to talk at all. Angelyne, for her part, has gone on AirTalk with host Larry Mantle to claim that the story contains \"a lot of inaccuracies\" and that the \"vindictive\" piece can never change the fact that she is \"not a woman\" but \"an icon.\" Indeed, she ran for mayor of Hollywood in 2008, per the Washington Post, and came in 28th out of 135 candidates; she also ran for governor of California in 2003 and, of course, has made numerous paid appearances at events and is the subject of a documentary. For now, the legend and sometimes-actress/singer who says she was orphaned at a young age and whose Hollywood start traces back to a 1974 porno tells Baum she wants to save her story for a memoir for \"my own financial interest.\" (The Kardashians have erected an elaborate and bizarre business empire.)"], "length": 16350}

The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route. As Krakauer writes, the \"wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion\" that broke free and caused last week's avalanche came from \"that same ice bulge\" and killed 16 Sherpas. As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60. Among the reasons it's gotten safer: Climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen, and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet, which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain). Krakauer points to an Outside piece that shares the professions with a lower calculated fatality rate than that of Sherpas: US soldiers stationed in Iraq between 2003 and 2007, miners, and commercial fishermen."], "length": 15568}

Such a pathological change in the vascular section exists for example in the form of an aneurysm, i.e. a morbid, locally delimited, frequently bag-like enlargement. An aneurysm can occur in particular in a blood vessel in the region of the brain or of the heart; however, the occurrence of an aneurysm is generally not restricted to a specific region of the body. The clinical significance of an aneurysm, which for example is localized in the brain, arises in particular from the risk of a rupture, i.e. the formation of a tear or burst, which for example can result in hemorrhages and thromboses. In modern medicine, the dynamics of the blood flow in an aneurysm are frequently considered to be a major factor in the pathogenesis of the aneurysm, i.e. in its formation and development. \n     This simulation of the blood flow by CFD methods imparts a three-dimensional distribution of the flow parameters, such as for example WSS (Wall Shear Stress), along the surface of the vascular lumen. \n     DE 10 2008 014 792 B3 describes such a method for simulating a blood flow in a vascular section, wherein a captured image of a vascular region including the vascular section is obtained, a 3D vascular", "answers": ["Two bodyguards who worked for Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen were sentenced to five years in prison for attempted murder over an incident during the couple's April 2009 wedding, Sky News reports.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Oatmeal compositions have been known for a long period of time. More recently, oatmeal food products have become available in prepackaged forms. Usually these products are in a dry form which need water for cooking. Packaging of oatmeal in water-containing form so that nothing need be added before consumer preparation has not been used due to the adverse effects such processing has on the flavor and texture of the resulting oatmeal product. Packaging oatmeal preparations with water can result in the final product in oat particles that have degraded to a form of thick paste which lacks texture. It would be desirable to have a complete oatmeal food product that could be prepared without the addition of water or other ingredients, and which may be stored in prepackaged form for long periods of time. It is an object of the invention to provide an optionally aseptically prepared oatmeal based food composition that retains a pleasing texture. It is another object of the invention to provide processes for optionally aseptically preparing an oatmeal based food composition that retains a pleasing texture. In accordance with these and other objects which will become apparent from the description below, one such process comprises: soaking steel cut oats and oat bran for a period of time sufficient to hydrate said steel cut oats and said oat bran and form a hydrated oat mixture; adding rolled oats as a dry feed to the hydrated oat mixture to form a cookable oat mixture; heating the cookable oat mixture for a period of time sufficient to cook the cookable oat mixture; and optionally aseptically packaging the cooked oat mixture. Alternatively, the preparation may be carried out in a retort apparatus, e.g., an open kettle, with additional cooking taking place after filling but before sealing of the containers. In the retort preparation, water, steel-out oats, oat bran and flavorings are combined, heated to a temperature sufficient to effect cook", "answers": ["Thanks to a team of researchers from Belgium, we may be close to synthesizing and, yes, possibly even bottling and selling the smell of human death, Discovery reports. Eva Cuypers and her team at the University of Leuven separated the tissues and organs of six humans and 26 different animals, placing them in jars to decompose over the next six months. By collecting the gases building up in the jars, researchers identified 452 organic compounds, according to Science. Eight of those compounds were found only in decomposing humans and surprisingly human-like pigs, and five of them were unique to humans. These five compounds—called esters—were created by decomposing muscles, carbohydrates, and fat, Discovery reports. The esters create a \"singular chemical cocktail\" in decomposing humans and could explain why so-called cadaver dogs are able to sniff out dead people amid any number of competing smells, including other dead animals, Science reports. Cuypers and her team published their findings last week. They believe the results could be used to better train cadaver dogs or even create a machine that could do the same job.

This is called \"suicide contagion.\" Contagion includes indirect as well as direct exposure to suicide, as Health and Human Services explains. Reading a newspaper article about a famous suicide and not just directly experiencing the death of a friend or an attempt made by a family member might propel someone who is at-risk to follow suit.\nThe researchers from University College London (UCL) studied 3,432 UK university staff and students aged 18-40 who had been bereaved, to examine the specific impacts associated with bereavement by suicide.\nAs well as the increased risk of suicide attempt, those bereaved by suicide were also 80 per cent more likely to drop out of education or work.\nIn total, 8 per cent of the people bereaved by suicide had dropped out of an educational course or a job since the death.\n\"Our results highlight the profound impact that suicide might have on friends and family members,\" said study author Alexandra Pitman from UCL.\n\"However, these outcomes are by no means inevitable.

And the social stigma around suicide may be a significant factor affecting a mourning person's outlook. \"Suicide in particular is often perceived as a taboo subject,\" Pitman notes. \"Avoiding the subject can make a bereaved person feel very isolated and stigmatized, and sometimes even blamed for the death.\" That's not to say, though, that having such a tragedy afflict a family member or close friend dooms a person to a similar sad fate. \"These outcomes are by no means inevitable,\" Pitman says. \"If you have been bereaved by suicide, you should know that are not alone and support is available.\" (A Marine unit has lost 14 members to suicide.)"], "length": 14919}

The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route. As Krakauer writes, the \"wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion\" that broke free and caused last week's avalanche came from \"that same ice bulge\" and killed 16 Sherpas. As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60. Among the reasons it's gotten safer: Climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen, and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet, which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain).

It is widely believed that confusion over U.S. cluster submunitions (BLU-97/B) that were the same color and size as air-dropped humanitarian food packets played a major role in the U.S. decision to suspend cluster munitions use in Afghanistan but not before using them in Iraq. In 2006, Israeli use of cluster munitions against Hezbollah forces in Lebanon resulted in widespread international criticism. Israel was said to have fired significant quantities of cluster munitions—primarily during the last 3 days of the 34-day war after a U.N. cease-fire deal had been agreed to —resulting in almost 1 million unexploded submunitions to which the U.N. attributed 14 deaths during the conflict. Reports maintain that Hezbollah fired about 113 \"cluster rockets\" at northern Israel and, in turn, Israel's use of cluster munitions supposedly affected 26% of southern Lebanon's arable land and contaminated about 13 square miles with unexploded submunitions. One report states that there was a failure rate of upward of 70% of Israel's cluster weapons. The fundamental criticisms of cluster munitions are that they disperse large numbers of submunitions imprecisely over an extended area, that they frequently fail to detonate and are difficult to detect, and that submunitions can remain explosive hazards for decades. Civilian casualties are primarily caused by munitions being fired into areas where soldiers and civilians are intermixed, inaccurate cluster munitions landing in populated areas, or civilians traversing areas where cluster munitions have been employed but failed to explode. Two technical characteristics of submunitions—failure rate and lack of a self-destruct capability—have received a great deal of attention. There appear to be significant discrepancies among failure rate estimates.

A roundup of coverage: Trump's first stop on the nine-day trip will be Saudi Arabia, where he is expected to address the leaders of 50 Muslim countries, CNN reports. McMaster says Trump's goal is \"to unite peoples of all faiths around a common vision of peace, progress, and prosperity,\" and his speech in Riyadh will focus on the need to \"confront radical ideology\" and allow a \"peaceful vision of Islam\" to dominate. Trump's second stop will be Israel, where his plans include visits to the Western Wall and the West Bank town of Bethlehem. Newsweek reports that the president had to call off a planned speech at the ancient hilltop site of Masada after Israel declined to allow a helicopter landing. A source tell the Jerusalem Post that Trump will not propose a peace plan at this point, though he may state his opposition to Israeli settlement expansion. The president's European stops will include meetings with Pope Francis and dozens of other leaders and heads of state, Time reports in a detailed look at his itinerary. Among them will be new French President Emmanuel Macron, who will meet Trump for a working lunch May 25. Sources tell the New York Times that Trump has complained to friends that he doesn't really want to go on the trip. His critics, fearing the possibility of monumental gaffes, would also like him to stay home. Stephen J. Hadley, George W. Bush's national security adviser, however, says such trips are tightly controlled and Trump will probably be at ease on the world stage. \"Remember, Trump is a nothing if not a showman,\" Hadley says. “He’s been very public for decades and very conscious about how he comes across in the media.\" Heritage Foundation foreign policy expert James Carofano tells the Washington Post that the trip abroad will be an opportunity for Trump to have a fresh start after his troubles in DC. \"The great thing about a trip, they control the environment, you control the interaction, you control the agenda and you control the press access,\" he says. \"If you fumble on one of these trips, it’s nobody’s fault but your own.\" Larry Sabato, head of the University of Virginia Center for Politics, disagrees. He tells the AP no other president has made a first foreign trip amid so much controversy. \"He's already a president viewed skeptically by much of the world.

The cannon have tragically been looted since the photographs were taken but some of the world's top experts in early ordnance who have looked at the photos believe that they are 15th or 16th century weapons, sometimes known as lombards.

It also admits that no tests, which could have revealed the geographical origin of the vessel, have been carried out on the ballast from the wreck. Likewise no detailed analysis has been carried out on the bronze objects found on the site – tests which might have revealed the objects' ages. Neither does the report really assess in any detail the case for there potentially being two wrecks, one early and one later, on the site, rather than just one. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The bronze items – a number of ship construction fasteners – is the main reason for rejecting it as the Santa Maria.

{"pred": "\nPassage 1:\nCongressional rules establish a general division of responsibility under which questions of policy are kept separate from questions of funding. Broadly, the term authorization is used to describe legislation that establishes, continues, or modifies the organization or activities of a federal entity or program. By itself, such legislation does not provide funding for such purposes. Instead, the authority to obligate payments from the Treasury is left to separate appropriations measures. This distinction between appropriations and general legislation as two separate classes of measures, and their consideration in separate legislative vehicles, is a construct of congressional rules and practices. It has been developed and formalized by the House and Senate pursuant to the constitutional authority for each chamber to \"determine the Rules of its Proceedings.\" This power permits each chamber of Congress to enforce, modify, waive, repeal, or ignore its rules as it sees fit. Because the two chambers exercise this rulemaking authority independently, they have developed differing (albeit generally similar) rules and practices. This report addresses solely developments in the House. According to Hinds' Precedents , the origin of a formal rule mandating the separation of general legislation from appropriations can be traced to 1835, when the House debated the increasing problem of delay in enacting appropriations due to the inclusion of \"debatable matters of another character, new laws which created long debates in both Houses\" and suggested that the Committee on Ways and Means should \"strip the appropriation bills of every thing but were legitimate matters of appropriation.\" In the following Congress (25 th Congress, 1837-1839), language was added to House rules that stated: No appropriation shall be reported in such general appropriation bills, or be in order as an amendment thereto, for any expenditure not previously authorized by law. This rule was applied broadly on occasion to exclude legislative provisions authorizing new expenditures as well, such as a case in 1838 when it was used to exclude an amendment that included a provision for refurnishing the White House. Gradually, the rule \"became construed through a long line of decisions to admit amendments increasing salaries but as excluding amendments providing for decreases", "answers": ["Walmart got a dose of positive headlines Thursday when it announced a bump in the wages it pays workers.

The Social Security Act and amendments established three programs that the agency administers: Old-Age and Survivors Insurance provides monthly retirement and survivors benefits to retired and disabled workers, their spouses and their children, and the survivors of insured workers who have died. SSA has estimated that, in fiscal year 2019, $892 billion in old-age and survivors insurance benefits are expected to be paid to a monthly average of approximately 54 million beneficiaries. Disability Insurance provides monthly benefits to disabled workers and their spouses and children. The agency estimates that, in fiscal year 2019, a total of approximately $149 billion in disability insurance benefits will be paid to a monthly average of about 10 million eligible workers. Supplemental Security Income is a needs-based program financed from general tax revenues that provides benefits to aged adults, blind or disabled adults, and children with limited income and resources. For fiscal year 2019, SSA estimates that nearly $59 billion in federal benefits and state supplementary payments will be made to a monthly average of approximately 8 million recipients. SSA relies heavily on its IT resources to support the administration of its programs and related activities. For example, its systems are used to handle millions of transactions on the agency's website, maintain records for the millions of beneficiaries and recipients of its programs, and evaluate evidence and make determinations of eligibility for benefits.

The worst of it took place in a three-hour span starting around midnight Saturday when 30 people were shot, reports the Sun-Times. Of those victims, 25 were injured in five mass shootings. Police say gang violence is mostly to blame, with shooters taking advantage of large gatherings in the summer weather to inflict the most casualties. \"If they shoot you, they don’t even run,” one man tells the Chicago Tribune. \"They just walk away, they ain’t trying to run.\" A police spokesman says the extra police presence at the music festival did not play a role in the violence because officers working it were generally on their regular days off and on OT. The violence prompted Rudy Giuliani to enter the fray with a series of tweets backing Garry McCarthy, a former Chicago police chief who hopes to unseat Mayor Rahm Emanuel. \"MAKE CHICAGO SAFE AGAIN!\" tweeted Giuliani, who worked with McCarthy in New York when Giuliani was mayor.

The leaders will have six hours of talks, a private dinner, and walks around the Sunnylands estate in Rancho Mirage to try to achieve it.

{"pred": "\nPassage 1:\nIt has been exactly two months since Gretchen Carlson, a former Fox News anchor, sued her old boss, Roger Ailes, for sexual harassment. The suit inaugurated a frenetic series of events, not only within Fox News's subterranean newsroom—where staffers feared for their jobs and, in one case, even the network's future—but also throughout the media, as other women came forward to share their own stories of harassment. It all resulted in Ailes's dramatic, and nearly mind-boggling, ouster from the news network that he co-founded 20 years ago. (Ailes has repeatedly, and fervently, denied all allegations of sexual harassment.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Friday, Ailes biographer and New York writer Gabriel Sherman, who has broken key elements of the story, published a lengthy cover article detailing Ailes's downfall. As I have reported, Ailes's own apparent paranoia increased around the time that Sherman began reporting his unauthorized biography, which was published in early 2014. According to a person close to Ailes, he hung a wooden door, now dismantled, that obscured any view into his office suite; according to numerous people, he also recorded anyone who entered. Ailes kept guns in the office (a Glock and Smith & Wesson were discovered by 21st Century Fox after his ouster). Carlson and others, including former Fox News booker Laurie Luhn, also detailed Ailes's alleged harassment, much of it outlined by Sherman in his coverage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the early days of the Ailes saga, many applauded how 21st Century Fox was handling the crisis. Rather than defending Ailes, C.E.O. James Murdoch and Executive Chairman Lachlan Murdoch heralded a new era at the media empire by investigating him.

We found that all five VA medical centers lacked at least some documentation of the reviews they told us they conducted, and in some cases, we found that the required reviews were not conducted at all.

FPPEs for cause are reviews of providers' care over a specified period of time, during which the provider continues to see patients and has the opportunity to demonstrate improvement. Documentation of these reviews is explicitly required under VHA policy. Additionally, VA medical center officials confirmed that FPPEs for cause that were required for another 21 providers were never conducted. The medical centers lacked documentation showing that retrospective reviews—which assess the care previously delivered by a provider during a specific period of time— had been conducted for 8 providers after concerns had been raised about their clinical care. One medical center lacked documentation showing that reviews had been conducted for another 12 providers after concerns had been raised about their care. In the absence of any documentation, we were unable to identify the types of reviews, if any, that were conducted for these 12 providers. We also found that the five selected VA medical centers did not always conduct reviews of providers' clinical care in a timely manner.

Many of those items were purchased using the Federal Supply Schedules, which provided medical centers with a great deal of flexibility. However, as we reported in 2016, this legacy program prevented VHA from standardizing items used across its medical centers and affected its ability to leverage its buying power to achieve greater cost avoidance. Standardization is a process of narrowing the range of items purchased to meet a given need, such as buying 10 varieties of bandages instead of 100, in order to improve buying power, simplify supply chain management, and provide clinical consistency. In part because of the legacy MSPV program's limited standardization, VHA decided to transition to a new iteration, called MSPV-NG. The transition to MSPV-NG has been a major effort, involving the MSPV-NG program office, stakeholders from the VHA's Procurement and Logistics Office and VA's Strategic Acquisition Center (SAC)—a VA-wide contracting organization—and logistics and clinical personnel at every medical center. The program also includes hundreds of new contracts with individual supply vendors and a new set of prime vendor contracts to distribute the supplies.

Trump departs Friday for an ambitious first foreign trip as president that will include Saudi Arabia, Israel, and the Vatican, a NATO meeting in Belgium, and the G7 summit in Sicily. A roundup of coverage: Trump's first stop on the nine-day trip will be Saudi Arabia, where he is expected to address the leaders of 50 Muslim countries, CNN reports. McMaster says Trump's goal is \"to unite peoples of all faiths around a common vision of peace, progress, and prosperity,\" and his speech in Riyadh will focus on the need to \"confront radical ideology\" and allow a \"peaceful vision of Islam\" to dominate. Trump's second stop will be Israel, where his plans include visits to the Western Wall and the West Bank town of Bethlehem. Newsweek reports that the president had to call off a planned speech at the ancient hilltop site of Masada after Israel declined to allow a helicopter landing. A source tell the Jerusalem Post that Trump will not propose a peace plan at this point, though he may state his opposition to Israeli settlement expansion. The president's European stops will include meetings with Pope Francis and dozens of other leaders and heads of state, Time reports in a detailed look at his itinerary. Among them will be new French President Emmanuel Macron, who will meet Trump for a working lunch May 25. Sources tell the New York Times that Trump has complained to friends that he doesn't really want to go on the trip. His critics, fearing the possibility of monumental gaffes, would also like him to stay home. Stephen J. Hadley, George W. Bush's national security adviser, however, says such trips are tightly controlled and Trump will probably be at ease on the world stage. \"Remember, Trump is a nothing if not a showman,\" Hadley says. “He’s been very public for decades and very conscious about how he comes across in the media.\" Heritage Foundation foreign policy expert James Carofano tells the Washington Post that the trip abroad will be an opportunity for Trump to have a fresh start after his troubles in DC. \"The great thing about a trip, they control the environment, you control the interaction, you control the agenda and you control the press access,\" he says. \"If you fumble on one of these trips, it’s nobody’s fault but your own.\" Larry Sabato, head of the University of Virginia Center for Politics, disagrees. He tells the AP no other president has made a first foreign trip amid so much controversy. \"He's already a president viewed skeptically by much of the world. And while the pictures from the trip may be great, the White House can't change the headlines that will follow him wherever he goes,\" he says. Melania Trump will be accompanying her husband on the trip, and her itinerary includes G7 and NATO spousal programs as well as speaking to American military families in Italy, Politico reports. \"This will not just be an opportunity to support my husband as he works on important matters of national security and foreign relations, it will also be my honor to visit and speak with women and children from different countries,\" she said in a statement Thursday.

Pistorius in particular comes off as an egomaniac with long-standing anger issues. \"When Pistorius competed at the London Olympics, last summer, (a radio host) interviewed the athlete’s roommate at the Olympic Village: ‘What is it like to sleep in the same room with a superstar?’ And he said, ‘I moved out. Oscar is always shouting at people on the phone.’\" A \"former confidant\" tells Seal that the Olympics changed Pistorius for the worse. “He was bragging about his adventures in the good life. He was like, ‘I’m the man, I’m Oscar. The world owes me.’ That sense of entitlement. He wasn’t like that; he was made into that.\" In subsequent training sessions at a gym, his “swearing would astonish the mothers and children also using the gym,\" says a reporter. “He would storm out of the gym midway through a workout. He would be surly, rude. It seemed as though he survived on energy drinks and caffeine pills.” Here's one assessment of the six-page article: \"After reading Seal’s piece, I’m convinced that Oscar Pistorius is kind of a jerk,\" writes Justin Peters at Slate. \"But while the piece definitely nudges the reader toward the conclusion that he murdered Steenkamp, it hasn’t cleared up all reasonable doubt.\" Read the Vanity Fair piece in full."], "length": 14303}

Eleven years later, Boulder's top prosecutor exonerated the Ramseys — but a new independent analysis of DNA evidence in the case calls that into question. ( Patrick Davison / Rocky Mountain News via AP ) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The DNA evidence in the JonBenet Ramsey case doesn't support a pivotal and controversial development in Colorado's most vexing unsolved murder — a former Boulder prosecutor's decision to clear the Ramsey family — but a new independent analysis of DNA evidence in the case calls that into question. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Forensic experts who examined the results of DNA tests obtained exclusively by the two news organizations disputed former District Attorney Mary Lacy's conclusion that a DNA profile found in one place on JonBenet's underpants and two locations on her long johns was necessarily the killer's — which Lacy had asserted in clearing JonBenet's family of suspicion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In fact, those experts said the evidence showed that the DNA samples recovered from the long johns came from at least two people in addition to JonBenet — something Lacy's office was told, according to documents obtained by the Camera and 9NEWS, but that she made no mention of in clearing the Ramseys. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The presence of a third person's genetic markers has never before been publicly revealed.

At the time, Lacy concluded that DNA evidence found on JonBenet's underwear and long johns belonged to a male intruder who was not part of the Ramsey family. But now three forensic experts who examined the DNA test results and lab reports used by Lacy say they do not support her conclusion. For one thing, a sample on her underwear identified as coming from \"Unknown Male 1\" may in fact be a composite from multiple people and thus \"worthless as evidence,\" says the news report. Another revelation that further muddles the picture: DNA samples on her long johns appear to come from JonBenet and at least two other people, not one, a fact that has never been revealed before. What's more, the independent experts say all of the unknown DNA may be the result of \"inconsequential contact with other people,\" reports the Camera. With the exoneration, \"I was trying to prevent a horrible travesty of justice,\" Lacy tells ABC.

The geek index, she explains, is determined by such factors as ability to focus, non-verbal IQ scores taken at age 12, and social aloofness. The latter trait may sound like a negative, but the BBC frames it as the boys not being overly concerned with fitting in. A mother's age appears to have no impact. The team studied more than 7,000 sets of twins in the UK. The average geek score for boys born to dads 25 or younger is 39. It goes up to 41 when dads had the child between 35 and 44, and jumps to 47 when dads were 50 or older.

Kids born to fathers 50 or older were 32% more likely to earn at least two A's on standardized tests than children born to men aged under 25, the researchers report in Translational Psychiatry. They calculate that 57% of the geek index score is inherited, with possible overlap between genes that contribute to a high geek score and to autism. “Our primary hypothesis is that higher levels of those ‘geeky’ traits in offspring of older men are mainly due is due to characteristics of the fathers themselves,\" Janecka tells Newsweek. \"Men who decide to delay fatherhood often do so due to their extended career and educational pursuits, and likely themselves display higher levels of ‘geekiness.’” (Younger fathers are also likelier to die younger.)"], "length": 16364}

The Environmental Protection Agency and the State Department are the hardest-hit agencies according to budget previews, with cuts of around 30%. Military spending would be beefed up by $54 billion under the proposal, $1.5 billion is earmarked for a border wall, and Homeland Security would get a 6.8% funding increase. A roundup of coverage about the $1.15 trillion spending plan: The document is here. Politico reports that the budget is \"red meat\" for Trump's base, with deep cuts to their most disliked government agencies and programs, though it is also what's known as a \"skinny budget\" because it is so short on details. A more detailed budget will be out in May. The AP lists winners and losers. The latter group includes the departments of Energy, Labor, and Transportation, along with after-school programs and many independent agencies supported by tax dollars. White House budget director Mick Mulvaney acknowledged that the cuts would lead to job losses, Reuters reports. \"You can’t drain the swamp and leave all the people in it,\" he said during a budget preview Wednesday. He said that White House officials had looked at Trump's campaign speeches, and \"turned those policies into numbers.\" The New York Times reports that congressional Republicans have already declared parts of the plan dead on arrival. \"The administration’s budget isn’t going to be the budget,\" Sen. Marco Rubio told reporters. \"We do the budget here. The administration makes recommendations, but Congress does budgets.\" The Hill notes that such proposals tend to be \"little more than guidance\" for lawmakers—and that the Senate shot down Obama's 2015 budget 98 to 1. The AP reports that the budget funds Trump's boost for the Pentagon, the biggest since Ronald Reagan's, with cuts to conservative targets including the National Endowment for the Arts, legal aid for the poor, and the AmeriCorps national service program. NBC notes that Trump's proposal, which makes cuts to 12 out of 15 Cabinet agencies, only covers the \"discretionary\" quarter of the $4 trillion budget for the fiscal year that starts in October.

Through these studies, they determined the condition of the FBI's current assets and identified gaps between current and needed capabilities, as well as studied a range of alternatives to meet the FBI's requirements. According to these assessments, the FBI's headquarters facilities did not fully support the FBI's long-term security, space, and building condition requirements. Since our report, the assessment of the Hoover Building has not materially changed. For example: Security: Since September 11, 2001, the FBI mission and workforce have expanded, and the FBI has outgrown the Hoover Building. As a result, the FBI also operates in annexes, including some located in the National Capital Region. During our 2011 review, FBI security officials told us that they have some security concerns—to varying degrees— about the Hoover Building and some of the headquarters annexes. In our report, we noted that the dispersion of staff in annexes created security challenges, particularly for at least nine annexes that were located in multitenant buildings, where some space was leased by the FBI and other space was leased by nonfederal tenants. While this arrangement did not automatically put FBI operations at risk, it heightened security concerns. In addition, in January 2017, we found that the FBI occupies space leased from foreign owners in at least six different locations, including one in Washington, D.C. Further, federal officials who assess foreign investments told us at that time that leasing space in foreign-owned buildings could present security risks, such as espionage and unauthorized cyber and physical access. Space: In 2011, we reported that FBI and GSA studies showed that much of the Hoover building's approximately 2.4 million gross square feet of space is unusable, and the remaining usable space is not designed to meet the needs of today's FBI.

We found that all five VA medical centers lacked at least some documentation of the reviews they told us they conducted, and in some cases, we found that the required reviews were not conducted at all. Specifically, across the five VA medical centers, we found the following: The medical centers lacked documentation showing that one type of review—focused professional practice evaluations (FPPE) for cause—had been conducted for 26 providers after concerns had been raised about their care, but officials at these medical centers could not provide documentation to show that almost half of these reviews were conducted. FPPEs for cause are reviews of providers' care over a specified period of time, during which the provider continues to see patients and has the opportunity to demonstrate improvement. Documentation of these reviews is explicitly required under VHA policy. Additionally, VA medical center officials confirmed that FPPEs for cause that were required for another 21 providers were never conducted.

The son of first-generation German Jewish immigrants, Julius Rosenwald, known to his friends as \"JR,\" apprenticed for his uncles, who were major clothing manufacturers in New York City. It would be as a men's clothing salesperson that JR would make his fateful encounter with Sears, Roebuck and Company, which he eventually fashioned into the greatest mail order firm in the world. He also founded Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry. And in the American South Rosenwald helped support the building of the more than 5,300 schools that bore his name. Yet the charitable fund he created during World War I went out of existence in 1948 at his expressed wish. Ascoli provides a fascinating account of Rosenwald's meteoric rise in American business, but he also portrays a man devoted to family and with a desire to help his community that led to a lifelong devotion to philanthropy.

It tells of Rosenwald's rise from the son of a peddler to a clothing manufacturing apprentice to CEO of the largest US retailer, Sears, Roebuck & Co., in 1908, reports the Times of Israel. It was around that time he began to see similarities between the treatment of blacks in America and pogroms against European Jews. When his rabbi became an NAACP leader, Rosenwald sponsored meetings. Soon after, he donated $25,000 to Alabama's Tuskegee University, led by Booker T. Washington, whose writings on racial equality and education had piqued his interest. Washington suggested the money go toward building six schools for black children, but Rosenwald contributed just a third of the funds and pushed the black and white communities to raise the rest. He went on to give $62 million to various causes, including the Rosenwald Fund, which created 5,300 schools in the South, attended by prominent African-Americans like Maya Angelou, George Wolfe, and Eugene Robinson.

{"pred": "\nPassage 1:\nAccording to NRC's website, the higher the radiation dose, the sooner the effects of radiation will appear, and the higher the probability of death. Radiation doses such as those received by survivors of the atomic bombs in Japan can cause cancers such as leukemia and colon cancer and, if levels are high enough, acute radiation syndrome. The symptoms of this syndrome range from nausea, fatigue, and vomiting to death within days or weeks. In contrast, the effects of low-dose radiation are more difficult to detect. In particular, below about 100 millisieverts (mSv) (10 rem)—the level below which the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's (National Academies) 2006 report on radiation and human health considered radiation to be low dose—data do not definitively establish the dose-response relationship between cancer and radiation exposure. In developing and applying radiation protection requirements and guidance for workers and the public—specifically, limits on dose or increased health risk and guidance levels on exposure—EPA, NRC, DOE, and FDA have generally taken the advice of scientific advisory bodies. In particular, they have relied on the advice of the International Commission on Radiological Protection, the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements, and the National Academies' Nuclear and Radiation Studies Board. This advice includes the use of the linear no-threshold model, which assumes that the risk of cancer increases with every incremental increase in radiation exposure. For example, the National Academies published a report in 2006 stating that the balance of evidence from various types of studies tends to favor a simple proportionate relationship between cancer and radiation exposure. According to the National Academies, the availability of new and more extensive data since the publication of its previous report in 1990 strengthened confidence in the 2006 report's estimates of cancer risk. The advisory bodies have recognized challenges in accurately estimating cancer risks from very low doses of radiation exposure when using the linear no-threshold model.

Whether and how fishes eliminate internal ice is unknown; one hypothesis is that it melts during summer warming episodes. However, prior in vitro evidence indicates that AFPs also inhibit melting. Our study establishes that pronounced melting inhibition occurs in vivo (i.e., superheated ice occurs inside notothenioid fishes).

Plus, as expected, Snap revealed that it doesn't make any money. It also said that it might never become profitable. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But investors might be coming around right in time for the IPO. Snap, apparently, is a lot of things. To consumers, it's a messaging company, but Snap calls itself a \"camera company.\" Now people are beginning to think of it as a serious media company that could draw ad dollars away from television spots. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If Snap can bring in considerable ad revenue, the company might come to resemble Facebook in the near future. Facebook is up more than 250% since its May 2012 IPO. The fear, though, is that Snap could become the next Twitter, which has fallen out of favor with users, advertisers, and invest", "answers": ["Those who remember the hype when Alibaba priced its initial public offering of stock in 2014 will get to relive that excitement Wednesday when Snap does the same. Reuters reports the owner of the Snapchat messaging app will serve up a number at the end of the trading day, with expectations of anywhere between $14 and $16 a share and a possible valuation of more than $20 billion. What the buzz is on this \"eagerly awaited\" IPO: Recode offers a quick-hit Q&A, including such queries as: \"What could possibly go wrong with Snap going public?\" Kids, teens, and young adults are the ones who use Snapchat the most, but it's the older generations who are more likely to be investors. The elder set's confusion over the vanishing messages could be a problem, per MarketWatch. All eyes would be on Snap CEO Evan Spiegel right now—if anyone could find him. The Wall Street Journal takes a closer look at the company's \"elusive\" (and apparently reticent) founder. \"Evan doesn't talk much,\" shrugs an early investor. The company's plans for the future are an important piece of the IPO puzzle. Sources tell the New York Times those plans may involve a drone. Despite Snapchat's sluggish user growth and the company's hefty hosting costs, Mad Money's Jim Cramer believes the trade will be a \"phenomenal\" one. \"I think the good absolutely outweighs the bad here,\" he says, per CNBC.

The two former guards have been charged as accessories to murder, the AP reports. They deny any knowledge of killings at the camp, where thousands were starved to death or froze. Prosecutors say prisoners were also gassed to death, shot, and killed with lethal injections.

He calls Alien: Covenant \"the most satisfying entry in the six-films-and-counting franchise since the first two.\" Beautiful and gripping, it \"feels vital\" and is \"keen to keep us on our toes right up to the concluding scene, which leaves the audience with such a great reveal that it makes you want to see the next installment tomorrow.\" Peter Howell at the Toronto Star agrees this flick \"ranks among the better chapters\" of the franchise. Scott \"breaks new ground even while revisiting old concepts\" and \"brings back the visceral panic that fans expect.\" Actors Katherine Waterston, Danny McBride, Billy Crudup, and Michael Fassbender—who delivers \"a grand performance times two\" as two separate robots—also deserve high praise, he writes. The inclusion of Fassbender's David, from 2012's Prometheus, was an incredibly smart move, writes Joe Morgenstern at the Wall Street Journal. But there was little else that impressed him. There's just \"nothing new\" to this \"gore fest,\" he writes. He acknowledges, however, that \"many Alien fans will come looking for something old, and that's in bloodily abundant supply.\" Chris Klimek had his own issues with the film. For example, \"a religious subtext is introduced and then immediately abandoned,\" he writes at NPR. But he, too, had to marvel at Fassbender, whose \"existential rap session\" provides the \"freshest part of the movie.\" Then again, Fassbender's David \"is the only character in whom Scott seems truly interested,\" he writes."], "length": 15977}

And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts—the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post—isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them. The Times notes President Obama's initiative to cut down on unnecessary outpatient antibiotic use by 50% by 2020; researchers say that, based on this study, we'll need to slash overall antibiotic use by 15% to meet that. \"If we continue down the road of inappropriate use we'll lose the most powerful tool we have to fight life-threatening infections,\" CDC Director Tom Frieden says. \"Losing these antibiotics would undermine our ability to treat patients with deadly infections [and] cancer, provide organ transplants, and save victims of burns and trauma.\" (Here's hoping teixobactin can help us out with superbugs.)"], "length": 15094}

Data were collected over a total period of 5 years and 4 months. The participants were recruited via the fertility center Instituto Valenciano de Infertilidad (IVI, Barcelona), by flyers and by word of mouth. We sought nulliparous individuals who were planning to try to become parents in the near future but were not pregnant yet and nulliparous individuals without such plans. Participants were therefore not randomly assigned to groups. Recruitment and data collection for all groups was initiated at the same time. Although individuals were recruited separately for the pregnancy (PRG) groups (women and men becoming parents between the sessions, hereafter referred to as F PRG and M PRG , respectively) and the control (CTR) groups (women who did not become pregnant within this time frame and men whose partners did not become pregnant, from here on referred to as F CTR and M CTR ) on the basis of their intention to become parents in the near future, the final group allocation depended on the transition from nulliparity into primiparity in between sessions. Women trying to become parents were scanned in the early follicular phase of their menstrual cycle or before the insemination or transfer in the fertility-treated group. Only participants who had never experienced a previous pregnancy beyond the first trimester were included in the study.

The study includes data on 25 Spanish women scanned before and after their first pregnancies, along with 20 women who didn't get pregnant during the study. The brain changes in the pregnancy group emerged from comparisons of those two groups. The results were consistent: A computer program could tell which women had gotten pregnant just by looking at results of the MRI scans. And the changes, first documented an average of 10 weeks after giving birth, were mostly still present two years after childbirth. (Based on prior research findings, the researchers think the brain changes happened during pregnancy). No brain changes were seen in first-time fathers, reports the AP. What's going on? Elseline Hoekzema, a study author at Leiden University in the Netherlands, and colleagues think the differences result from sex hormones that flood the brain of a pregnant woman. In 11 places in the brain, the MRI data indicate reductions in volume of the brain's gray matter, but it's not clear what that means. For example, it could reflect a pruning of the places where brain cells communicate, called synapses. Losing some synapses is not necessarily a bad thing. It happens during a hormonal surge in adolescence, producing more specialized and efficient brain circuits. The researchers suspect that could be happening in the pregnant women, perhaps to prepare a woman for motherhood.

{"pred": "\nPassage 1:\nThere's already plenty of bad punditry regarding the chances of Hillary Clinton — who officially announced her candidacy on Sunday — to become the 45th president. You can find Democrats boasting about their \"blue wall\" in the Electoral College and how hard this will make it for any Republican to win. Or Republicans warning that the Democratic Party rarely wins three elections in a row. Most of this analysis is flimsy. So is the commentary about the ups-and-downs in early swing state polls. And when you see some pundit declaring a minor misstep to be a \"game changer,\" find someone else to follow on Twitter. The truth is that a general election win by Clinton — she's very likely to become the Democratic nominee — is roughly a 50/50 proposition. And we're not likely to learn a lot over the rest of 2015 to change that. Here's why: Incumbency and Obama's Approval Rating. Start with the fact that there's no incumbent president running. There actually haven't been a lot of cases that precisely meet the circumstances voters will face next year: Barack Obama, assuming he serves out the rest of his term, will become just the fifth president limited by the 22nd Amendment from seeking an additional term in office. Still, the evidence we have from presidential elections and from other contexts like gubernatorial elections is that these cases default to being toss-ups. Clinton's chances will be affected by Obama's popularity as he exits office. The relationship between the popularity of the previous president and the performance of the new nominee from his party isn't perfect — Al Gore (narrowly) lost in 2000 despite Bill Clinton's popularity, for example — but it certainly matters some, especially given that Clinton served in Obama's cabinet. Obama currently has an approval rating of about 45 percent, and a favorability rating of 48 percent — about average, in other words.

Silver questions the so-called \"Emerging Democratic Majority\" that plays a role in Chait's thinking.

It was established by the Communications Act of 1934 (1934 Act, or \"Communications Act\") and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable. The mission of the FCC is to ensure that the American people have available, \"without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex, a rapid, efficient, Nationwide, and worldwide wire and radio communication service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges.\" The 1934 Act is divided into titles and sections that describe various powers and concerns of the commission. Title I—FCC Administration and Powers. The 1934 Act originally called for a commission consisting of seven members, but that number was reduced to five in 1983. Commissioners are appointed by the President and approved by the Senate to serve five-year terms; the President designates one member to serve as chairman. Title II—Common carrier regulation, primarily telephone regulation, including circuit-switched telephone services offered by cable companies. Common carriers are communication companies that provide facilities for transmission but do not originate messages, such as telephone and microwave providers. The 1934 Act limits FCC regulation to interstate and international common carriers, although a joint federal-state board coordinates regulation between the FCC and state regulatory commissions. Title III—Broadcast station requirements. Much existing broadcast regulation was established prior to 1934 by the Federal Radio Commission, and most provisions of the Radio Act of 1927 were subsumed into Title III of the 1934 Act. Title IV—Procedural and administrative provisions, such as hearings, joint boards, judicial review of the FCC's orders, petitions, and inquiries. Title V—Penal provisions and forfeitures, such as violations of rules and regulations.

According to testimony in Flint district court Friday morning, three workers in the state's health department—Nancy Peeler, Robert Scott, Corinne Miller—and three in the environmental office—water regulators Patrick Cook and Adam Rosenthal and ex-municipal water chief Liane Shekter-Smith—were hit with charges filed by AG Bill Schuette, per the Detroit Free Press. MLive.com reports that all six were charged with misconduct in office, with willful neglect of duty and various conspiracy charges also being assigned. Schuette filed criminal charges in April against two other state employees and a city water utility official. In the Department of Health and Human Services, alleged transgressions include reliance on shoddy data and hiding or ignoring bloodstream test results that indicated the significant presence of lead. Within the Department of Environmental Quality, accusations include workers manipulating water monitoring reports, purposely \"misinterpreting\" federal drinking-water standards, and trying to mislead the EPA, as well as suggesting ways to keep an EPA expert quiet about concerns. Shekter-Smith, meanwhile, is said to have turned a blind eye as evidence of water contamination became clearer. Meanwhile, per the Wall Street Journal, federal experts say filtered Flint tap water is safe to drink, but Mayor Karen Weaver noted Wednesday at the Democratic convention that the city's crisis is far from over. \"Our infrastructure is broken, leaking, and rusting away,\" she said, per CNN."], "length": 14624}

Trump said Russian leader Vladimir Putin was \"probably\" behind the assassination of diplomats, but it didn't seem like he was losing sleep over it, the Washington Post reports. \"It's not in our country,\" he said. Trump also told Stahl that Russia meddled in the 2016 election, but said China had done the same. \"I think, frankly, China is a bigger problem,\" he said. \"We won\" on Christine Blasey Ford.

Where did it all go wrong for the Wisconsin governor? Insiders tell Politico that Walker was overconfident, and though he tried to act as his own campaign manager, he seemed to be \"making it up as he went along,\" causing plenty of strategic blunders. Fundraising dried up as Donald Trump's rise pushed him to the sidelines, leaving him with a large organization but little support. His sudden departure from the race came after he failed to make an impression at the second debate and a CNN poll found his support at well below 1%. \"He was a terrible candidate, but he also got Trump-ed,\" a source tells Politico. More: Sources tell CNN that although a super PAC supporting him had plenty of cash, Walker's campaign funds started to dry up after the first debate as donors looked elsewhere. Walker \"is a pragmatist above all else and just didn't see the path to a comeback\" after his poll numbers collapsed even in Iowa, a campaign insider says. Walker was hurt by flip-flops on issues like birthright citizenship, where he changed his position three times in a week, CNN notes, and by gaffes like suggesting he would consider building a wall along the Canadian border. In his exit speech last night, Walker said he had been \"called to lead by helping to clear the field in this race so that a positive conservative message can rise to the top of the field.\" He urged other candidates to follow his lead so a clear alternative to Trump could emerge, the Washington Post reports. Some of Walker's former rivals praised him as he left the race, including Marco Rubio, who called him \"one of the best governors in the country,\" and Donald Trump, who said \"he's a very nice person and has a great future,\" reports the Hill. The rival campaigns didn't wait until Walker announced his exit to start trying to poach his aides and his donors, the AP reports. The competition heated up after the announcement: A source close to the billionaire Ricketts family, which had supported Walker, tells the AP that within minutes of the governor's press conference, the family received calls from six campaigns, some of them from the candidates themselves.

The woman who's adorned hundreds of billboards across LA since the 1980s under the one-name pseudonym Angelyne—she's been called a precursor to other \"famous for being famous\" celebrities like Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian—appears to have started off as Ronia Tamar Goldberg. She came to California in 1959 by way of Israel, and her mother died of cancer at the age of 44 when Goldberg, who upon arrival to LA became Renee, was just 14. Baum reached out to Goldberg's alleged younger sister, now Annette Block, and her husband, as well as an ex-husband and a stepsister, all of whom are generally hazy on details if willing to talk at all.

{"pred": "\nThe Justice Department and the FBI have launched a review of thousands of criminal cases to determine whether any defendants were wrongly convicted or deserve a new trial because of flawed forensic evidence, officials said Tuesday. The undertaking is the largest post-conviction review ever done by the FBI. It will include cases conducted by all FBI Laboratory hair and fiber examiners since at least 1985 and may reach earlier if records are available, people familiar with the process said. Such FBI examinations have taken place in federal and local cases across the country, often in violent crimes, such as rape, murder and robbery. The review comes after The Washington Post reported in April that Justice Department officials had known for years that flawed forensic work might have led to the convictions of potentially innocent people but had not performed a thorough review of the cases. In addition, prosecutors did not notify defendants or their attorneys even in many cases they knew were troubled. On Tuesday, the Justice Department announced that it will conduct the more expansive review. The Department and the FBI are in the process of identifying historical cases for review where a microscopic hair examination conducted by the FBI was among the evidence in a case that resulted in a conviction, spokeswoman Nanda Chitre said in a statement. We have dedicated considerable time and resources to addressing these issues, with the goal of reaching final determinations in the coming months. The Post identified two District men convicted largely on the testimony of FBI hair analysts who wrongly placed them at crime scenes. Santae A. Tribble, now 51, was convicted of killing a taxi driver in 1978, and Kirk L. Odom, now 49, was convicted of a sexual assault in 1981. Since the Post report, Tribble's conviction was vacated, and on Tuesday, prosecutors moved to overturn Odom's conviction and declare him innocent. The Justice Department had not previously reviewed their cases. The review comes as the National Academy of Sciences is urging the White House and Congress to remove crime labs from police and prosecutors' control, or at least to strengthen the science and standards underpinning the nation's forensic science system.", "answers": ["Impressed when an FBI forensic expert testifies in court? Jurors likely are too, but the FBI's hair-comparison unit actually gave unscientific testimony against criminal defendants for more than 20 years before 2000, according to the FBI and the Justice Dept. Among the FBI's 28 microscopic hair experts, 26 \"overstated forensic matches\" to favor the prosecution in nearly all of the 268 cases reviewed so far, the Washington Post reports. \"The FBI’s three-decade use of microscopic hair analysis to incriminate defendants was a complete disaster,\" says Peter Neufeld, who helped found the Innocence Project. The reviewed cases include 32 defendants given the death sentence, 14 of whom have already died in prison or were executed; about 2,500 cases involving hair matches are being looked at in all. Of course, other evidence may have sufficed to convict defendants found guilty. But the FBI, acknowledging the problem, has agreed to work with the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL) and the Innocence Project in reviewing cases between 1972 and 1999. Now 46 states and the District of Columbia are receiving information that could lead to appeals, if defense lawyers, prosecutors, or judges are willing or able. Truth is, there's no scientific standard for matching hair, the Post says. Worse, the forensic-hair scandal is only part of an ongoing review of all criminal forensics, which the Post has reported on here, here, and here. \"The forensic science system ... has serious problems that can only be addressed by a national commitment to overhaul the current structure,\" a science panel concluded back in 2009."], "length": 14207}

The devices—which were discovered by two men who found the backpack on top of a garbage can outside a restaurant near the Elizabeth station—will be closely examined for evidence linking them to explosive devices found in New York City and elsewhere in New Jersey over the weekend. A round-up of coverage: Elizabeth Mayor Christian Bollwage says the two men thought the backpack held something of value and carried it some distance before realizing it held explosive devices and calling police, NJ.com.

{"pred": "\nThe rise of e-commerce has contributed to a fundamental change in the market for counterfeit goods, according to our analysis of documents from CBP, ICE, and international organizations and our interviews with CBP and ICE officials. U.S. agencies and international organizations have observed a shift in the sale of counterfeit goods from \"underground\" or secondary markets, such as flea markets or sidewalk vendors, to primary markets, including e-commerce websites, corporate and government supply chains, and traditional retail stores. Whereas secondary markets are often characterized by consumers who are knowingly purchasing counterfeits, primary markets involve counterfeiters who try to deceive consumers into purchasing goods they believe are authentic. This shift has been accompanied by changes in the ways in which counterfeit goods are sold. In the past, consumers could often rely on indicators such as the location of sale or the goods' appearance or price to identify counterfeit goods in the marketplace. However, counterfeiters have now adopted new ways to deceive consumers. For example, as consumers increasingly purchase goods online, counterfeiters may exploit third-party online marketplaces to gain an appearance of legitimacy and access to consumers. When selling online, counterfeiters may post pictures of authentic goods on the websites where they are selling counterfeits and may post pseudonymous reviews of their products or businesses in order to appear legitimate. Additionally, by setting the price of a counterfeit at, or close to, the retail price of a genuine good, counterfeiters may deceive consumers, who will pay the higher price because they believe the goods are real or who believe that they are getting a slight bargain on genuine goods. According to CBP seizure data and CBP officials, the volume, variety, and methods of shipment of counterfeit goods seized by CBP and ICE have changed in recent years. CBP reports indicate that the number of IPR seizures increased by 38 percent in fiscal years 2012 through 2016. According to CBP data, approximately 88 percent of IPR seizures made during this period were shipped from China and Hong Kong.

JWST is being designed for a 5-year mission to find the first stars, study planets in other solar systems to search for the building blocks of life elsewhere in the universe, and trace the evolution of galaxies from their beginning to their current formation. JWST is intended to operate in an orbit approximately 1.5 million kilometers—or 1 million miles—from the Earth. With a 6.5-meter primary mirror, JWST is expected to operate at about 100 times the sensitivity of the Hubble Space Telescope. JWST's science instruments are designed to observe very faint infrared sources and therefore are required to operate at extremely cold temperatures. To help keep these instruments cold, a multi-layered tennis court-sized sunshield is being developed to protect the mirrors and instruments from the sun's heat. The JWST project is divided into three major segments: the observatory segment, the ground segment, and the launch segment. When complete, the observatory segment of JWST is to include several elements (Optical Telescope Element (OTE), Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM), and spacecraft) and major subsystems (sunshield and cryocooler). The hardware configuration referred to as OTIS was created when the Optical Telescope Element and the Integrated Science Instrument Module were integrated. Additionally, JWST is dependent on software to deploy and control various components of the telescope, and to collect and transmit data back to Earth. The elements, major subsystems, and software are being developed through a mixture of NASA, contractor, and international partner efforts. See figure 1 for the elements and major subsystems of JWST and appendix 1 for more details, including a description of the elements, major subsystems, and JWST's instruments.
