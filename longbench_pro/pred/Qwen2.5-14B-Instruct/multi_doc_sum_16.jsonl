However, half of these prescriptions for acute respiratory conditions were deemed unnecessary, representing 34 million antibiotic prescriptions annually. The White House's National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria aims to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use in outpatient settings by 50% by 2020, which would require a 15% reduction in overall antibiotic use based on the study's findings. Antibiotic resistance is a significant public health challenge, with CDC estimating that at least 2 million people acquire antibiotic-resistant infections and 23,000 die each year in the US. The study highlights the importance of proper antibiotic stewardship and the role of healthcare providers in ensuring appropriate antibiotic use. Pharmacists play a crucial role in educating patients about the risks of unnecessary antibiotic use and promoting proper antibiotic use. The study underscores the need for concerted efforts to address the issue of antibiotic resistance and promote responsible antibiotic use. Additionally, the CDC's 2013 Antibiotic Resistance Threats Report identified the top 18 antibiotic-resistant threats in the US, categorizing them into three levels of concern - urgent, serious, and concerning - and highlighting gaps in knowledge and core actions needed to combat antibiotic resistance.

And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts—the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post—isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them. The Times notes President Obama's initiative to cut down on unnecessary outpatient antibiotic use by 50% by 2020; researchers say that, based on this study, we'll need to slash overall antibiotic use by 15% to meet that. \"If we continue down the road of inappropriate use we'll lose the most powerful tool we have to fight life-threatening infections,\" CDC Director Tom Frieden says. \"Losing these antibiotics would undermine our ability to treat patients with deadly infections [and] cancer, provide organ transplants, and save victims of burns and trauma.\" (Here's hoping teixobactin can help us out with superbugs.)"], "length": 13649}

Additionally, those bereaved by suicide were 80% more likely to drop out of education or work. The research highlights the profound impact of suicide bereavement on individuals and emphasizes the importance of support for those affected. The study also revealed that perceived social stigma around the death of a loved one by suicide could exacerbate the negative outcomes, suggesting that addressing stigma might mitigate its effects. Furthermore, the findings indicate that a history of suicide among non-blood relatives and friends should be considered when assessing suicide risk, extending beyond just blood relatives. The research underscores the need for comprehensive support and understanding for individuals bereaved by suicide, advocating for compassionate and practical assistance from employers and communities. The study's innovative approach in distinguishing between different types of sudden bereavement provides valuable insights into the specific risks associated with suicide bereavement. However, the sample's demographic limitations, primarily consisting of highly educated individuals, may affect the generalizability of the findings. Despite this, the research constitutes a significant contribution to understanding the impact of suicide bereavement on mental health and occupational functioning.

The shrine, known as Our Lady of Good Help, has attracted increasing numbers of visitors seeking spiritual solace and divine intervention, despite not yet reaching the global fame of other Marian shrines like Lourdes or Guadalupe. The validation comes at a time when the Catholic Church faces challenges due to sex abuse scandals, and is seen as a source of hope and healing for believers. The decision was based on extensive investigation by theologians who found no evidence of fraud or heresy and noted a long history of shrine-related conversions, cures, and other signs of divine intervention. Local church officials are now considering expanding facilities to accommodate the growing influx of visitors. Additionally, the shrine's grounds and the crowd gathered there were spared during the devastating Peshtigo Fire of 1871, adding to the credibility of the apparitions. Visitors attest to feeling a palpable presence of Mary and experiencing spiritual benefits, reinforcing their belief in the authenticity of the apparitions.

{"pred": " The BFG, directed by Steven Spielberg and based on Roald Dahl's beloved children's book, faced significant box office challenges upon its release, particularly in the US, where it earned only around $22 million over the July 4th holiday weekend. This performance is considered disappointing given the film's $140 million budget and the anticipation generated by Spielberg's reputation and Disney's backing. Critics argue that the film's failure stems from several factors: Spielberg's shift towards more serious, adult-oriented films, the relatively lesser-known status of Roald Dahl's work compared to other children's literature franchises, and the film's ambiguous positioning between a children's movie and an adults' one. Additionally, the film's title, \"The BFG,\" was deemed confusing for audiences unfamiliar with the source material. Despite these setbacks, the film's critical reception was generally positive, with praise for Mark Rylance's performance and the film's visual effects. However, the movie failed to capture the depth and darkness present in Dahl's original story, resulting in a somewhat superficial adaptation. The box office flop of The BFG does not necessarily indicate a broader trend, as Spielberg's upcoming projects, such as Ready Player One, continue to hold promise. Furthermore, the passage highlights the importance of effective marketing strategies and the need for films to resonate with both children and adults to achieve commercial success. Lastly, the Internet Archive's initiative to preserve web pages and their referenced content aims to mitigate the issue of broken links on the internet, ensuring that the original context and intent of web pages remain accessible. This effort involves archiving pages as they are created and updating links to reflect the archived versions, thereby preserving the integrity of online information.

Here's what some of the experts are saying: Slash Film argues you can't blame Spielberg for the failure, as he's far from the first director to flop when adapting a story by Roald Dahl. In fact, only one film based on a Dahl book—Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory—has made more than $34 million in US theaters. The Wrap has a list of seven reasons The BFG bombed, from \"Roald Dahl is no JK Rowling\" to a lack of stars and a confusing title. The BFG might be proof it's time for Spielberg to step away from family films, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which points out the director hasn't had a hit family film since Hook a quarter of a century ago. He's had better luck with recent grown-up fare like Lincoln and Bridge of Spies. The Wall Street Journal details Spielberg's history of being able to \"bounce back\" after cinematic disappointments, something he should have a good chance of doing with his next three films currently including a historical drama, a science-fiction movie based on a popular book, and an Indiana Jones sequel. But the \"reason this stings\" is because every other time Spielberg disappointed at the box office, it was with a \"good for you\" film, according to Forbes.

Snowden left his job and family in Hawaii to expose what he deemed an \"existential threat to democracy\", arguing that the government had overstepped its bounds and lacked proper oversight. Federal agents are investigating Snowden and preparing to build a case against him, while supporters hail him as a hero and critics label him a traitor or potential threat to national security. Snowden chose Hong Kong as his initial refuge due to its press freedoms and extradition treaty with the U.S. that includes political offense exemptions, making his fate uncertain and dependent on political calculations in both Hong Kong and Beijing. The controversy has reignited discussions about the balance between privacy protections and counterterrorism efforts, with some lawmakers calling for reform of surveillance programs. \n\nKey evidence includes Snowden's detailed disclosures about NSA monitoring of phone and internet data, as well as his previous work experience at the CIA and Booz Allen Hamilton. Supporters argue Snowden revealed information already known to terrorists, while opponents claim the programs have helped thwart terrorist plots. The U.S. government maintains the programs are legal, effective and subject to oversight, but is open to debate and potential changes if public opinion shifts. Snowden's location in Hong Kong complicates efforts to bring him to justice, as extradition is not guaranteed due to political considerations. Overall, the incident has thrust the issue of government surveillance into the spotlight and sparked a national conversation about civil liberties. \n\nInnovative points include Snowden's strategic choice of Hong Kong as a safe haven and the potential for the controversy to spur reforms to surveillance programs.

Some things to know about the historic flyby, which comes 50 years to the day after the first successful flyby of Mars: New Horizons will have to capture a vast amount of data in a short time. The probe will be pushed to its limits as it pivots to capture photos and information on Pluto and its moons Charon, Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra during the flyby. \"I can't wait to get into the data and really start making sense of it. Right now, we're just standing under the waterfall and enjoying it,\" principal New Horizons scientist Alan Stern tells the BBC. We don't know whether it was a success. The probe is far too busy to \"phone home,\" the AP notes, but it's expected to send a confirmation signal at around 9pm tonight. The eagerly awaited first photos from the flyby should be released tomorrow night, the Guardian reports, though it will take 16 months to send all the data from the flyby back to Earth. We've already learned a lot of new things about Pluto. \"The science we've already made is mouth-watering,\" says Stern. \"The Pluto system is enchanting in its strangeness and its alien beauty.\" Among NASA's findings in recent days: Pluto's North Pole has an icy cap and the planet's diameter is 1,597 miles across, not 1,471 miles as previously thought. The finding suggests the planet contains a lot more ice and a lot less rock than thought, the Christian Science Monitor reports. There are still a lot of mysteries to be solved. Scientists hope the first close-up look at Pluto's surface will explain features like heart- and doughnut-shaped features recently spotted for the first time. LiveScience notes that new information from Pluto could help explain how our own planet formed and how life began. \"There's a feeling among scientists that Pluto probably will tell us what the early solar system looked like and it's now locked in deep freeze and maybe it will tell us what we once were, a long time ago,\" the director of the Deep Space Communication Complex tells Reuters.

His piece makes plain the imbalance between the dangers faced by Sherpas and the climbers they shepherd to the mountain's peak, but before arriving at that point, he shares a fascinating backstory: That of Himex, a New Zealand-based company that Krakauer calls the most \"lucrative commercial guiding operation\" on Everest—one that on May 7, 2012, packed up shop after 18 years on the mountain and headed home, taking its guides, members (aka paying climbers, who didn't see their $60,000 refunded), and Sherpas with them. The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route. As Krakauer writes, the \"wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion\" that broke free and caused last week's avalanche came from \"that same ice bulge\" and killed 16 Sherpas. As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60. Among the reasons it's gotten safer: Climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen, and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet, which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain).

{"pred": " \nA new study by Pecan Street Research Institute challenges the conventional wisdom that solar panels in the Northern Hemisphere should face south to maximize energy generation. The study, conducted in Austin, Texas, found that west-facing solar panels produced 2% more electricity daily and 49% more during peak demand hours (3-7 pm) compared to south-facing panels. This is significant because it reduces homeowners' reliance on grid electricity during peak hours by 65%, compared to 54% for south-facing panels. The study suggests that west-facing panels align better with typical household energy consumption patterns, particularly in summer when people return home and turn on air conditioning in the late afternoon. This finding could broaden the appeal of solar installations to homeowners with west-facing roofs and potentially ease pressure on utility grids during peak demand periods. However, the optimal orientation may vary by region due to local weather conditions and utility company incentives. The study highlights the importance of practical testing over theoretical assumptions in solar panel installation practices. \n\nKey evidence includes data from 50 Austin homes, showing higher peak hour generation and reduced grid dependency for west-facing panels. The study also notes that utility companies often prefer south-facing panels due to their higher annual energy yield, despite the benefits of west-facing panels during peak demand. The research could prompt utilities to reconsider their rebate policies and encourage more flexible solar panel orientations tailored to regional conditions and consumer behavior. \n\nThis innovative approach to solar panel orientation emphasizes the need for customized solutions that optimize both individual energy savings and grid stability. The findings underscore the potential for west-facing panels to play a crucial role in managing peak demand and enhancing the overall efficiency of renewable energy systems. \n\nNote: The summary integrates insights from all three passages, focusing on the core argument and key evidence while omitting repetitive details.

The virus has an incubation period of 5-10 days and can cause symptoms ranging from fever and muscle pain to severe bleeding and organ failure, with a fatality rate between 23-90%. Uganda has experienced several outbreaks of Marburg, including one in 2012 that resulted in four deaths out of 15 cases. President Museveni highlighted the importance of job creation and import substitution, praising initiatives like the Uganda Youth Livelihood Programme and the Uganda Women Entrepreneurship Programme for promoting economic growth. Historical outbreaks of Marburg virus have occurred in various regions, with notable cases in Germany, Yugoslavia, South Africa, Kenya, Russia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola, and Uganda. These outbreaks have shown varying fatality rates, with some resulting in high mortality and others containing the spread effectively. The virus is primarily transmitted through direct contact with bodily fluids of infected individuals or animals, and there is currently no specific treatment or vaccine available. However, Uganda's health system has demonstrated the ability to contain outbreaks through rigorous surveillance and control measures. The most recent Marburg case in Uganda in 2012 had a fatality rate of 27%, indicating that while the virus remains dangerous, effective containment strategies can mitigate its impact. CDC Director Thomas Frieden cited the successful handling of the Marburg case as an example of how deadly viruses can be contained with proper public health infrastructure and response networks. The President emphasized the need for disciplined spending and reducing foreign travel expenses to allocate more funds for programs like Operation Wealth Creation, which aims to boost economic opportunities for youth and women.

{"pred": " Holocaust survivor Judith Meisel, 88, played a crucial role in identifying Johann Rehbogen, a former SS guard at the Stutthof concentration camp, aiding German prosecutors in indicting him and another ex-guard, Harry Paul Fritz Schulz, on accessory to murder charges. The indictments, based on new legal guidelines allowing prosecution of former Nazis who assisted in camp operations, highlight the ongoing pursuit of justice for World War II atrocities. Meisel's testimony, alongside other survivors', is pivotal in challenging the defendants' claims of ignorance regarding the killings at Stutthof, where approximately 65,000 people perished through various forms of execution. The charges underscore the significance of historical accountability and the enduring impact of the Holocaust on survivors and their families. Additionally, the indictment of two former guards in their 90s by German prosecutors marks a significant step in addressing past crimes, despite the defendants denying involvement in the killings. The legal reasoning behind these prosecutions hinges on the assumption that guards were aware of the systematic killings and thus contributed to the deaths of numerous prisoners. This approach opens new avenues for holding perpetrators accountable, even decades after the crimes were committed. The indictments also reflect the broader effort to ensure that the atrocities of the Holocaust are not forgotten and that justice is sought for victims and their families. Meisel's willingness to relive her traumatic experiences underscores the importance of bearing witness and seeking justice, providing a powerful testament to the resilience and moral imperative of Holocaust survivors. The unique aspect of these cases lies in the innovative legal framework that allows for prosecution based on the role in camp operations rather than direct involvement in specific killings, marking a significant shift in how historical crimes are addressed. This approach ensures that individuals who facilitated the machinery of genocide can still face legal consequences, reinforcing the commitment to historical truth and justice. The indictments serve as a reminder of the ongoing relevance of confronting the past and the critical role of survivors in ensuring that history is not forgotten. The legal pursuit of former Nazis continues to evolve, reflecting a broader societal commitment to acknowledging and addressing the horrors of the Holocaust. The indictments of Rehbogen and Schulz exemplify this evolving approach, highlighting the enduring quest for justice and the importance of historical accountability. The legal reasoning behind these prosecutions represents a significant innovation in addressing historical crimes, emphasizing the collective responsibility of those who participated in the operation of concentration camps. This approach ensures that the legacy of the Holocaust remains a central focus of legal and ethical considerations, reinforcing the imperative to confront and address past atrocities.", "answers": ["Judith Meisel says that when she was a teenager in the Stutthof concentration camp in western Poland, other prisoners told her: \"Don't let us die without you mentioning what happened to us.\" The 88-year-old Minnesota resident has not forgotten: Her testimony helped German authorities indict two former guards from the camp where 65,000 people, including Meisel's mother, died, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reports.

Analyzing 50 homes in Austin, Texas, the study found that west-facing solar panels produced 2% more electricity daily and 49% more during peak demand hours (3-7 pm) compared to south-facing panels. This is significant because it aligns with when homeowners typically consume the most electricity, easing strain on the grid. The study also revealed that west-facing panels reduced peak energy usage by 65%, compared to 54% for south-facing panels. Notably, this finding could expand the residential solar market to homeowners with west-facing roofs, potentially altering industry norms and utility rebate policies. However, the study was conducted during summer months, and its applicability to other seasons remains uncertain.

His piece makes plain the imbalance between the dangers faced by Sherpas and the climbers they shepherd to the mountain's peak, but before arriving at that point, he shares a fascinating backstory: That of Himex, a New Zealand-based company that Krakauer calls the most \"lucrative commercial guiding operation\" on Everest—one that on May 7, 2012, packed up shop after 18 years on the mountain and headed home, taking its guides, members (aka paying climbers, who didn't see their $60,000 refunded), and Sherpas with them. The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route. As Krakauer writes, the \"wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion\" that broke free and caused last week's avalanche came from \"that same ice bulge\" and killed 16 Sherpas. As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60. Among the reasons it's gotten safer: Climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen, and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet, which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain). Krakauer points to an Outside piece that shares the professions with a lower calculated fatality rate than that of Sherpas: US soldiers stationed in Iraq between 2003 and 2007, miners, and commercial fishermen."], "length": 12933}

{"pred": " President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un held a historic summit in Singapore on June 12, 2018, marking the first-ever meeting between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader. Despite initial hostile rhetoric, the two leaders displayed cordiality and mutual respect during the summit. They signed a joint statement committing to work towards the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and establishing new relations between the two countries. However, the statement lacked concrete details on how denuclearization would be achieved or defined. Critics argue that the summit elevated Kim's status as a global leader and failed to address human rights abuses in North Korea. The summit featured numerous photo opportunities and pleasantries, but substantive progress on denuclearization remained elusive. Prior to the summit, Trump faced criticism from detractors who believed he was granting undue legitimacy to Kim without sufficient concessions from North Korea. Despite these criticisms, Trump maintained that the summit was a success and that a comprehensive deal would be negotiated in subsequent meetings. Overall, the summit represented a significant diplomatic shift but fell short of achieving tangible results on denuclearization. \n\nKey evidence includes the joint statement signed by Trump and Kim, which committed to denuclearization and improved relations but lacked specifics. Critics highlight the lack of progress on human rights issues and the potential risks of elevating Kim's international standing. Trump emphasized the return of American hostages and cessation of North Korean nuclear testing as positive outcomes, while also noting that the summit was merely the beginning of a longer negotiation process. The summit showcased a dramatic transformation in the relationship between the two leaders, from threats of nuclear war to a display of camaraderie, though the long-term implications remain uncertain. \n\nInnovative points include the unprecedented nature of the summit itself and the symbolic significance of the meeting, which marked a departure from decades of hostility between the U.S. and North Korea.

The author suggests shifting the focus to introducing girls to female role models in leadership positions, explaining the day-to-day responsibilities and rewards of leadership, and supporting programs that actively identify and groom female talent. Key evidence includes statistics showing that women make up only 3.6% of Fortune 500 CEOs, 14% of executive officers, and 16% of board directors. The author emphasizes the importance of visibility and interaction with successful women, noting that boys naturally see a variety of male leaders in their lives. Additionally, the author highlights the success of Princeton University's initiative to encourage female students to apply for academic prizes, resulting in 3 out of 4 Rhodes Scholars being women in 2011. The author also introduces the concept of sponsorship versus mentoring, where sponsors actively push their protégés towards opportunities and use their political capital on their behalf. The overarching message is that simply showing girls what an office looks like is no longer enough; they need to be brought inside the halls of power to prepare them for leadership roles in the future. The author concludes by emphasizing that real breakthroughs will come when girls are exposed to leadership roles and encouraged to pursue them. This approach aims to address the disparity in women's representation in top leadership positions and promote fairness and social equality. The author's perspective is that proactive efforts are necessary to move women into leadership roles and that these efforts should start early, even in grade school, to make leadership more tangible and accessible to girls. The author also underscores the importance of hearing directly from both male and female leaders about their roles and responsibilities to help close the gap in girls' perceptions of their own leadership capabilities. The author's recommendation is to take girls into the C-suite now so they can lead in the future, thereby fostering a pipeline of female leaders and addressing the current disparity in leadership roles. The author's argument is supported by the observation that despite the progress made in the past two decades, women's rates of top leadership have barely budged, indicating a persistent need for targeted interventions to support women's advancement into leadership positions.

The latest polls show a dead heat, reports AP, as leaders on both sides try to rally support—especially Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, whose political life may be at stake. “I ask you to say no to ultimatums, blackmail, and fear-mongering,” he said in a TV address. “No to divisions, no to those who want to spread panic.” He sought to downplay the notion that a \"no\" vote could lead to Greece leaving the euro zone. Instead, he said, the referendum is about giving him more leverage to get a better deal from creditors. It's the only way Greece can \"live with dignity in Europe,\" he said, per the BBC. The Washington Post has a primer on the financial reasons behind the vote, but a story in the New York Times casts it in more personal terms. It's largely become a referendum on Tsipras himself, and the story suggests that's why European leaders itching to get rid of him limited emergency funds to Greek banks this week. The move set off a panic among people scrambling for cash, and his popularity tumbled. “I don’t see how anybody can believe that the timing of this was coincidence,” says a US economist. “When you restrict the flow of cash enough to close the banks during the week of a referendum, this is a very deliberate move to scare people.” Tsipras initially said he would step down if the \"yes\" vote prevails, but he has since backed down from that position."], "length": 12308}

{"pred": " \nThe discovery of a potential ninth planet in our solar system has reignited debates about Pluto's planetary status. Astronomers Mike Brown and Konstantin Batygin from Caltech have inferred the existence of a giant icy planet, dubbed \"Planet Nine\", based on the unusual orbits of small objects in the outer solar system. They estimate Planet Nine to be about five to ten times the mass of Earth and two to four times its diameter. While direct observation remains elusive, the researchers argue that Planet Nine meets the criteria for a planet, unlike Pluto, which was demoted due to its small size and inability to clear its orbital path. The evidence for Planet Nine includes a clustering of orbits of distant objects that can only be explained by the gravitational pull of a large planet. Other astronomers have cautiously supported the theory, though direct detection is still pending. The potential discovery of Planet Nine highlights the dynamic nature of our understanding of the solar system and the ongoing quest to uncover its mysteries. \n\nKey points:\n- Evidence for Planet Nine comes from the unusual orbits of small objects in the outer solar system.\n- Researchers estimate Planet Nine to be about five to ten times the mass of Earth.\n- Unlike Pluto, Planet Nine is believed to meet the criteria for a planet.\n- Direct observation of Planet Nine remains challenging due to its distance from the sun.\n- The discovery of Planet Nine could redefine our understanding of the solar system. \n\nUnique insights:\n- The research builds on previous studies that hinted at a massive perturber in the outer solar system.\n- The potential discovery of Planet Nine underscores the evolving nature of planetary science and the solar system's complexity. \n\nThis summary integrates the main arguments and evidence from the selected passages without summarizing each passage individually, focusing on the key points about Planet Nine's existence and implications for our understanding of the solar system.

Astronomers at the California Institute of Technology say a giant celestial body \"lurking at the end of our solar system,\" as the Washington Post puts it, may actually be a planet, and they're even already calling it \"Planet Nine.\" In their research published in the Astronomical Journal, the sky-watching scientists—one of whom is known as the \"Pluto killer\" for his role in getting Pluto demoted—think their find is five to 10 times as massive as Earth, and per the AP, almost as big as Neptune and orbiting billions of miles past that planet's orbit. Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal. Now they're simply hoping more astronomers join in to actually try to spot the alleged planet—and they're not concerned it will face Pluto's fate. \"That's not even a question—it's definitely a planet,\" Brown says.

Playboy's circulation has plummeted from 5.6 million in the 1970s to 800,000 today, reflecting the impact of digital media.

A roundup of coverage: Trump's first stop on the nine-day trip will be Saudi Arabia, where he is expected to address the leaders of 50 Muslim countries, CNN reports. McMaster says Trump's goal is \"to unite peoples of all faiths around a common vision of peace, progress, and prosperity,\" and his speech in Riyadh will focus on the need to \"confront radical ideology\" and allow a \"peaceful vision of Islam\" to dominate. Trump's second stop will be Israel, where his plans include visits to the Western Wall and the West Bank town of Bethlehem. Newsweek reports that the president had to call off a planned speech at the ancient hilltop site of Masada after Israel declined to allow a helicopter landing. A source tell the Jerusalem Post that Trump will not propose a peace plan at this point, though he may state his opposition to Israeli settlement expansion.

His critics, fearing the possibility of monumental gaffes, would also like him to stay home. Stephen J. Hadley, George W.

Trump seemed disinterested in the idea of a book, but \"his non-disapproval became a kind of passport for me to hang around,\" writes Wolff. And so Wolff writes he spent each week at the Hay-Adams hotel, scheduled appointments with senior staffers, and \"plunk[ed] myself down, day after day, on a West Wing couch.\" The excerpt shares other tidbits—how the Secret Service protested the president's attempts to lock himself in his bedroom; how Trump's post-dinner calls to billionaire pals spurred leaks; how Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump thought Anthony Scaramucci would be the White House's saving grace—which Trump's lawyer is now trying to block from release. The Washington Post reports Wolff and his publisher, Henry Holt and Co., have been sent a letter that demands they \"immediately cease and desist from any further publication, release, or dissemination of the book\" or any excerpts; the lawyer also wants a copy and says a libel suit is being considered."], "length": 12588}

Governor Jan Brewer celebrated the ruling as a victory for state sovereignty and criticized the federal government's handling of immigration. Sheriff Joe Arpaio vowed to continue enforcing state laws despite criticism and potential legal challenges. Justice Scalia dissented, arguing the framers would oppose the Obama administration's selective enforcement of immigration laws and criticizing the court's decision as contradictory to the president's recent executive action on immigration. Reaction from various stakeholders highlighted the complex political and legal ramifications of the ruling, with some viewing it as a win for federal authority and others expressing concerns about potential racial profiling. The decision could influence similar laws in other states and may become a contentious issue in the upcoming presidential election. \n\nKey evidence included the court's reasoning that the \"show me your papers\" provision did not clearly conflict with federal law but warned against overly broad application, while other provisions were preempted by federal immigration statutes. The ruling emphasized the federal government's primary role in immigration enforcement. \n\nUnique points made included Scalia's historical framing of the debate and the potential for ongoing litigation and political battles over immigration policy.

He said the ruling particularly \"boggles the mind\" in light of Obama's recent executive order on immigration. He said delegates at the constitutional convention would have \"rushed to the exits\" at the thought of Obama's move.

For example: Jan Brewer called it a \"victory for the rule of law,\" and for the 10th Amendment, because \"the heart of SB 1070 can now be implemented,\" meaning the provision requiring police to check the immigration status of people stopped for other crimes. Joe Arpaio agreed. \"I think this is a good section that's been upheld,\" he said, though he lamented the loss of \"the authority to arrest illegal aliens just by being there illegally.\" President Obama said he was also \"pleased\" with the decision, which \"makes unmistakably clear (that) Congress must act on comprehensive immigration reform,\" but said he was still \"concerned\" about the remaining provision, according to CNN.

However, a joint investigation by the Boulder Daily Camera and KUSA-TV revealed that the DNA samples from both the underwear and long johns may be composite samples from multiple people, including JonBenet, an unknown male, and possibly a third unidentified person. This challenges Lacy's assertion that the DNA conclusively pointed to an intruder as the killer. Independent experts argue that the presence of the DNA could have an innocent explanation, such as transfer from other people or clothing. Lacy maintains her stance, citing lack of motive and psychopathy in the family, and accuses Boulder police of ignoring evidence pointing away from the Ramseys. Current Boulder County DA Stan Garnett emphasizes that no case is solely reliant on DNA and that all evidence must be accounted for.

The research, published in Translational Psychiatry, found that the older the father, the higher the geek index score, particularly after age 45. This effect was not observed in girls. Boys with higher geek index scores performed better academically, especially in STEM subjects. The study suggests that some genetic factors associated with geekiness and autism may be more prevalent in older fathers, potentially explaining why the effect is more pronounced in boys.

The proposal—titled \"America First: A Budget Blueprint to Make America Great Again\"—contains cuts that the Washington Post says could be the biggest reduction in federal programs since the post-World War II drawdown. The Environmental Protection Agency and the State Department are the hardest-hit agencies according to budget previews, with cuts of around 30%. Military spending would be beefed up by $54 billion under the proposal, $1.5 billion is earmarked for a border wall, and Homeland Security would get a 6.8% funding increase. A roundup of coverage about the $1.15 trillion spending plan: The document is here. Politico reports that the budget is \"red meat\" for Trump's base, with deep cuts to their most disliked government agencies and programs, though it is also what's known as a \"skinny budget\" because it is so short on details. A more detailed budget will be out in May. The AP lists winners and losers. The latter group includes the departments of Energy, Labor, and Transportation, along with after-school programs and many independent agencies supported by tax dollars. White House budget director Mick Mulvaney acknowledged that the cuts would lead to job losses, Reuters reports. \"You can’t drain the swamp and leave all the people in it,\" he said during a budget preview Wednesday. He said that White House officials had looked at Trump's campaign speeches, and \"turned those policies into numbers.\" The New York Times reports that congressional Republicans have already declared parts of the plan dead on arrival. \"The administration’s budget isn’t going to be the budget,\" Sen. Marco Rubio told reporters. \"We do the budget here. The administration makes recommendations, but Congress does budgets.\" The Hill notes that such proposals tend to be \"little more than guidance\" for lawmakers—and that the Senate shot down Obama's 2015 budget 98 to 1. The AP reports that the budget funds Trump's boost for the Pentagon, the biggest since Ronald Reagan's, with cuts to conservative targets including the National Endowment for the Arts, legal aid for the poor, and the AmeriCorps national service program. NBC notes that Trump's proposal, which makes cuts to 12 out of 15 Cabinet agencies, only covers the \"discretionary\" quarter of the $4 trillion budget for the fiscal year that starts in October. The portion dealing with issues including taxation, Social Security, and Medicare is due in mid-May. The Washington Post reports that the budget proposal's elimination of funding for public broadcasting means that Big Bird's doom has been predicted once again, though public broadcasting has survived previous \"zero funding\" proposals all the way back to Richard Nixon."], "length": 12586}

{"pred": " The selected passages discuss the paradoxical impact of antifreeze proteins (AFPs) in Antarctic notothenioid fishes. These proteins prevent freezing by binding to ice crystals and inhibiting their growth, but they also inhibit melting, leading to the accumulation of ice within the fish's bodies. Researchers found that ice persists inside the fish even when temperatures rise above the expected melting point, indicating that AFPs induce superheating of ice. This phenomenon was observed both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that the fish cannot rely on seasonal warming to eliminate internal ice. Long-term temperature records from Antarctic fish habitats confirm that summer warming does not consistently exceed the temperatures required to melt the ice stabilized by AFPs. Consequently, while AFPs offer crucial protection against freezing, they may also pose a long-term risk by allowing ice crystals to accumulate inside the fish, potentially causing harm. This discovery highlights an unexpected trade-off in the evolutionary adaptation of these fish, showcasing how beneficial traits can sometimes come with unforeseen costs. The research underscores the complexity of evolutionary adaptations and the potential for seemingly advantageous traits to have negative consequences. \n\nKey evidence includes laboratory observations of ice persistence in fish serum and purified AFPs, field experiments confirming the presence of superheated ice in wild fish, and long-term temperature records showing insufficient warming to reliably melt internal ice. The innovative aspect lies in identifying the dual role of AFPs in both preventing freezing and inhibiting melting, revealing a previously unrecognized risk associated with this evolutionary adaptation. \n\nOverall, the findings challenge the assumption that AFPs solely confer benefits and suggest that further research is needed to understand the long-term impacts of ice accumulation on the health and survival of these fish.

This conclusion is based on mathematical and computer modeling of the unusual orbits of distant objects in the Kuiper Belt, rather than direct observation. The researchers, including Mike Brown, who previously played a key role in Pluto's demotion, argue that Planet Nine's discovery is inevitable within the next five years and that it will not face the same controversy as Pluto due to its substantial size and gravitational influence. Brown acknowledges the emotional attachment some have to Pluto but maintains that the new planet's existence aligns with the current scientific understanding of the solar system.

Astronomers at the California Institute of Technology say a giant celestial body \"lurking at the end of our solar system,\" as the Washington Post puts it, may actually be a planet, and they're even already calling it \"Planet Nine.\" In their research published in the Astronomical Journal, the sky-watching scientists—one of whom is known as the \"Pluto killer\" for his role in getting Pluto demoted—think their find is five to 10 times as massive as Earth, and per the AP, almost as big as Neptune and orbiting billions of miles past that planet's orbit. Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal. Now they're simply hoping more astronomers join in to actually try to spot the alleged planet—and they're not concerned it will face Pluto's fate. \"That's not even a question—it's definitely a planet,\" Brown says.

This change is thought to be driven by hormonal fluctuations during pregnancy and persists for at least two years postpartum. Researchers compared brain scans of 25 first-time mothers before and after pregnancy to 20 women who did not become pregnant during the study period. The altered brain regions were linked to social cognition and emotional attachment, potentially aiding maternal behavior. The study also found that these changes were not observed in first-time fathers, indicating a pregnancy-specific effect. Additionally, the brain changes were associated with stronger emotional attachment to infants and heightened neural responses to images of their own babies, suggesting a preparatory role for motherhood. The research highlights the dynamic nature of the brain and its adaptability to life-changing events like pregnancy. \n\nKey evidence includes the MRI scans showing consistent gray matter volume reductions in specific brain regions among pregnant women, the persistence of these changes over two years, and the correlation between brain alterations and maternal attachment.

{"pred": " The articles emphasize the need to shift the focus of Take Our Daughters to Work Day from simply exposing girls to workplaces to encouraging them to aspire to leadership positions. Jennifer Allyn argues that girls no longer struggle to envision themselves in various jobs; instead, they require guidance and inspiration to pursue leadership roles. The authors highlight that women hold only 3.6% of CEO positions, 14% of executive officer roles, and 16% of board directorships in Fortune 500 companies, indicating a significant disparity in leadership representation. To address this, companies should introduce girls to high-ranking female role models, clarify the daily responsibilities and rewards of leadership, and implement ongoing programs to nurture female talent. Additionally, the articles suggest that mentorship alone is insufficient; sponsorship, where influential individuals advocate for and provide opportunities to their protégées, is crucial for advancing women into leadership positions. The Girl Scouts' research reveals that many girls feel uncomfortable leading and doubt their suitability for such roles, underscoring the importance of direct interaction with leaders to dispel these perceptions. Furthermore, the authors cite Princeton University's success in increasing female participation in prestigious academic honors through proactive encouragement, illustrating the impact of targeted support in fostering ambition and leadership aspirations among young women. Overall, the articles advocate for a comprehensive approach to empower girls to envision themselves as future leaders and to create pathways for their advancement in corporate environments. The key innovation lies in moving beyond mere exposure to workplaces and actively fostering leadership potential among girls. The articles also stress the urgency of addressing the persistent gender gap in leadership roles, emphasizing that this disparity undermines fairness and social equality and hinders the competitiveness of organizations and the broader society. The articles conclude by calling for a shift towards \"Take Our Daughters to the C-Suite Day,\" urging stakeholders to bring girls into the inner workings of leadership to inspire and prepare them for future leadership roles. This initiative aims to bridge the gap between aspiration and achievement, ensuring that girls are equipped with the knowledge, confidence, and support needed to succeed in leadership positions.
