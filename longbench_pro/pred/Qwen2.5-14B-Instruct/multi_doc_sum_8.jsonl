{"pred": " The research conducted by Kasumovic and Kuznekoff examines sexist behavior in online environments, particularly in multiplayer video games like Halo 3. Their study reveals that lower-skilled male players exhibit more hostility towards female teammates, while higher-skilled males are more supportive. This behavior is attributed to evolutionary principles, where lower-status males feel threatened by the presence of a competitive woman, leading them to display aggression to maintain their social standing. Conversely, higher-status males, who have less to lose, become more positive and supportive towards women, possibly as a strategy to attract them. The study highlights that sexist behavior is more pronounced among men who struggle in the game, suggesting that such behavior stems from insecurities rather than inherent malice. The findings underscore the importance of understanding the underlying psychological mechanisms driving sexist behavior and imply that addressing these issues might involve fostering environments where losing to women is normalized and accepted. The research also draws parallels between online gaming communities and other male-dominated spaces, indicating that similar dynamics may be at play in various contexts, including real-world settings. The study's methodology, utilizing an ecological design in a natural setting, adds credibility to its conclusions by avoiding biases commonly found in laboratory settings. \n\nThis research offers a unique perspective on the origins of sexist behavior, linking it to evolutionary pressures and social hierarchies, and suggests that improving the self-esteem and competitiveness of lower-status males could mitigate such behaviors. The findings are particularly relevant given the prevalence of online harassment, especially targeting women, and the potential for these dynamics to influence broader societal interactions. The study's innovative approach using video games as a proxy for real-life behavior provides valuable insights into the complex interplay between performance, status, and gender relations. \n\nInnovative points include the use of Halo 3 as a platform to observe naturalistic behavior without social desirability bias, the application of evolutionary theory to explain sexist behavior, and the suggestion that addressing the insecurities of lower-status males could reduce sexist tendencies. The research underscores the need for further exploration into how these dynamics manifest in other contexts beyond gaming environments. \n\nOverall, the study provides a compelling argument for considering both social and biological factors in understanding and addressing sexist behavior, emphasizing the role of status and performance in shaping attitudes towards women in competitive settings. \n\nNote: The summary integrates key points from both passages, focusing on the main arguments, evidence, and innovative aspects of the research.

Scientists who conducted the study published in Plos One played 163 games of Halo as either male-voiced players or female-voiced players (82 female, 81 male) with remote teammates and opponents. The study gauged a remote player's skill by measuring such factors like kills and deaths. Researchers found men were typically cordial to players they believed to be male, and that more skilled men who kicked first-shooter butt were less likely to direct negative comments toward female-voiced players than their less skilled male counterparts. But lamer players tended to take their frustrations out on female players with more frequent, caustic comments. A lead author notes that gaming provides the perfect breeding ground for this kind of behavior: After all, the Post notes, players can remain anonymous, they may never run into an online teammate or opponent again, and it's a significantly male-biased recreation. Females threaten gamers' \"pre-existing social hierarchy\"; the guys at the bottom of the virtual totem pole feel threatened and therefore become more threatening to those they think they can quash the easiest. \"As men often rely on aggression to maintain their dominant social status, the increase in hostility towards a woman by lower-status males may be an attempt to disregard a female's performance and suppress her disturbance on the hierarchy to retain their social rank,\" the study notes. Such gamer communities mirror male-dominated industries—such as engineering or the tech field—and may promote sexist actions in real life, scientists warn."], "length": 6269}

The law also reduces early voting periods and eliminates same-day voter registration. Hillary Clinton criticized such voter ID laws and the Supreme Court's recent Voting Rights Act ruling, arguing they disproportionately affect minority voters and threaten to undermine voting rights progress. Clinton emphasized the persistence of racial discrimination in American elections and urged Congress to pass legislation to address the issue. She also signaled her intention to address other significant topics in the coming months, including national security policies and America's global leadership. Passage 2 details Anthony Weiner's candid interview with BuzzFeed, where he acknowledged ongoing therapy for his sexting scandal and hinted at his wife Huma Abedin's potential role in Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign. Weiner addressed the negative impact of the scandal on his wife's career and criticized the media's coverage of his mayoral campaign. Passage 4 outlines Hillary Clinton's transition to co-leading the Clinton Foundation alongside her husband and daughter, marking a new phase in her post-State Department career. The foundation aims to tackle issues such as women's empowerment, early childhood development, and economic growth. Clinton's involvement provides her with a platform to engage in meaningful work while maintaining a distance from daily political debates. Passage 3 highlights Clinton's criticism of stricter voter ID laws and the Supreme Court's recent Voting Rights Act ruling, emphasizing the persistence of racial discrimination in American elections and urging Congress to address the issue. Clinton also encouraged the Justice Department to enforce existing voting laws and called for legislation to replace portions of the Voting Rights Act struck down by the Supreme Court. She emphasized the importance of addressing disparities in access to voting and improving overall voter access.

The closure of these stores will result in approximately 11,000 job losses. The decision to close these stores is based on a review that found some locations were impacting other clubs and where population growth did not meet expectations. Sam's Club CEO John Furner stated that the company aims to right-size its fleet and better align its locations with its strategic goals. The company plans to offer support and resources to affected employees, including placing them in new roles at nearby locations and providing severance pay to eligible employees.

The US pledges to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025, doubling the annual reduction rate from 1.2% to 2.3% to 2.8%. Meanwhile, China commits to peaking its carbon emissions around 2030, with the aim of surpassing this target sooner, and increasing the share of non-fossil fuel energy sources to 20% by 2030. Both nations intend to submit these targets to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change by the first quarter of 2015, setting a precedent for other countries to follow suit and fostering a global climate agreement in Paris later that year. This collaborative effort signifies a significant shift in the historically divided stance of the two nations in climate negotiations, demonstrating a united front towards combating climate change. The US highlights its progress in clean energy sectors, tripling wind energy production and increasing solar energy tenfold since 2009, while China emphasizes its commitment to restructuring its economy, reducing air pollution, and driving an energy revolution. These commitments underscore the necessity for both countries to lead in reducing global carbon emissions, recognizing that neither can solve the issue alone. The announcements are expected to inject momentum into upcoming climate negotiations and encourage other nations to present their own ambitious targets. The scale of China's commitment is particularly noteworthy, requiring the deployment of up to 1,000 gigawatts of new power from zero-emission sources by 2030, equivalent to all current coal-fired power plants in China.

{"pred": " Researchers have discovered that antifreeze proteins in Antarctic notothenioid fish, which prevent ice crystals from growing, also inhibit them from melting, leading to ice crystals persisting in the fish's blood and organs despite rising temperatures. This paradoxical effect was observed in laboratory tests where ice crystals did not melt even when temperatures were raised above the freezing point. Continuous temperature records from McMurdo Sound, Antarctica, showed that natural summer warming was insufficient to consistently eliminate internal ice. The spleens of the fish contained the highest concentration of ice crystals, suggesting a possible filtration mechanism. The implications of this phenomenon on the fish's long-term health remain uncertain, highlighting the complex trade-offs in evolutionary adaptations. This discovery underscores the intricate balance between beneficial traits and potential drawbacks in evolutionary processes. The findings were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The antifreeze proteins, while crucial for survival in freezing conditions, may pose risks by allowing ice to accumulate within the fish's circulatory system, potentially causing harm. The study reveals that the ice crystals can persist even in slightly warmer conditions, indicating that the fish may face lifelong exposure to internal ice, which could have unforeseen consequences on their physiology. The research team's work emphasizes the need for further investigation into the long-term impacts of this adaptation. The innovative aspect of this study lies in identifying the dual function of antifreeze proteins and the potential negative consequences of this adaptation. The findings challenge the conventional understanding of antifreeze proteins and highlight the complexity of evolutionary adaptations. The study also demonstrates the importance of continuous monitoring and detailed analysis of environmental conditions to fully understand the ecological implications of such adaptations. The research contributes to a broader understanding of evolutionary biology and the intricate balance between survival advantages and potential physiological costs.

{"pred": " The Latter-day Saints believe that monogamy is the Lord's standing law of marriage, but in biblical times, God commanded some to practice plural marriage. Joseph Smith received a revelation in the early 1840s instructing him to reintroduce plural marriage, which was practiced by some Church members under the direction of the Church President for over half a century. The reasons for God's commandment are not fully understood, but it is believed to have increased the number of children born into the faith and strengthened the sense of unity among the believers. The practice faced significant challenges, including legal prohibitions and societal opposition, leading to the issuance of the Manifesto in 1890, which declared the intention to submit to anti-polygamy laws. However, a small number of plural marriages continued to be performed in Canada and Mexico until 1904, when the Second Manifesto made new plural marriages punishable by excommunication. The practice of plural marriage was a trial of faith for many, but it resulted in numerous benefits for the Church, including an increased number of children born into the faith and a stronger sense of cohesion among members. The Church no longer practices plural marriage, but it allows sealing of deceased individuals to all of their spouses to whom they were legally married. The introduction of plural marriage was a significant challenge, but it allowed for the continuation of the faith and the creation of a strong community of believers. The practice was introduced gradually and incrementally, and participants were asked to keep their actions confidential until the Church leaders publicly acknowledged the practice. The historical record of early plural marriage is limited due to the secretive nature of the practice, and some ambiguity remains surrounding the exact number of women Joseph Smith was sealed to and the nature of these sealings. Despite the challenges, many participants testified of powerful spiritual experiences that helped them overcome their hesitation and accept the practice. The decision to accept plural marriage usually came after earnest prayer and intense soul-searching, and sacred experiences enabled the Saints to move forward in faith. The practice of plural marriage was difficult for all involved, especially for Joseph Smith's wife Emma, who struggled with the decision to support or reject the practice. The practice of plural marriage was a significant aspect of the Restoration, and its introduction and eventual cessation reflect the ongoing dialogue between the Church and its members with God's will. The Church acknowledges the contributions of scholars to the historical content presented in the passages and encourages members to trust in their wise Heavenly Father, who loves His children and does all things for their growth and salvation", "answers": ["The Mormon church's big revelations didn't stop with its sacred undergarments: In an online essay titled \"Plural Marriage in Kirtland and Nauvoo,\" the church for the first time declares that founder Joseph Smith was a polygamist, with a footnote stating that \"careful estimates\" put his tally of wives at between 30 and 40. The essay explains that Smith was ordered to take multiple wives by an angel who visited him three times between 1834 and 1842; in the last instance, the angel was armed with a sword and threatened a reluctant Smith. The leader, then married to first wife Emma, took his first plural wife, Fanny Alger, in Kirtland, Ohio. Smith and Alger ultimately separated, and the church relocated to Nauvoo, Ill., where he married many more women. The oldest was 56, and the youngest was 14-year-old Helen Mar Kimball; some were already married, a revelation the New York Times describes as the \"biggest bombshell for some.\" The essay explains that a number of marriages, including that with Kimball, were sealed \"for eternity alone,\" suggesting sexual relations weren't involved (the ones that did involve sex were \"for time and eternity\"). What did Emma think of all this? Per the essay, she was none too pleased, though at one time she did accept four of Smith's wives into their home. And what was the reasoning behind what the essay describes as the \"wrenching trial\" of polygamy? Kimball said Smith told her that \"the practice of this principle would be the hardest trial the Saints would ever have to test their faith.\" Two more essays discuss plural marriage in the church's later years; they're part of an effort the church is making to share \"reliable, faith-promoting\" info about its past, the church's historian tells the Times.

According to Bloomberg and Fox News, Rice made dozens of requests to unmask U.S. persons in intelligence reports related to the Trump transition and campaign, despite her previous denial of knowledge regarding such activities. The unmasking of these names allowed for their dissemination across various government departments, including the National Security Council, Defense Department, and CIA. Critics argue that this contradicts civil liberty principles and highlights potential misuse of surveillance powers.

The incident has also drawn attention to the oversight mechanisms in place for such sensitive operations and the potential for abuse of power. \n\nKey evidence includes the discovery of Rice's unmasking requests during a National Security Council review, the presence of valuable political information in the intelligence reports, and the timing of these requests coinciding with the Trump transition period.

Trump critics, meanwhile, say the story doesn't amount to much and accuse the White House of trying to divert attention from the president's wiretapping allegations. A look at coverage: A key story comes from Eli Lake at Bloomberg News. He reported Monday that Rice requested the identities of Trump transition officials who were mentioned, but not named, in US intelligence reports. Those reports were mostly summaries of monitored conversations between foreign officials talking about the Trump transition, but sometimes between Trump associates and foreign officials. (The National Security Council logs of Rice's requests are apparently what Rep. Devin Nunes went to the White House to view.) Lake's piece raises questions about why Rice wanted those names revealed—she didn't respond to the story—but he also notes that her requests \"were likely within the law.\" He adds that the story doesn't \"vindicate\" Trump's unsupported accusation that Obama wiretapped Trump Tower. Adam Housley of Fox News also reported on Rice's requests, and his appearance on the network prompted Trump himself to weigh in via tweet: \"Such amazing reporting on unmasking and the crooked scheme against us by @foxandfriends.

The conservative NewsBusters blog accused ABC, NBC, and CBS of covering up the story by failing to report on the \"massive revelation\" Monday in their evening broadcasts.

A Red Cross convoy was allegedly hijacked by armed men and there are rumors that inmates who escaped during the storm have been ambushing people carrying supplies. Communist rebels have declared a ceasefire in disaster areas, but troops say there has been at least one attack. Some 2,357 people have been confirmed dead, but the toll is expected to rise significantly as remote areas hit hard by the storm are reached. In Tacloban, where bodies are being trucked to mass graves, the city administrator says he is sticking by his original estimate of 10,000 dead in the city alone. In a smaller city south of Tacloban, the devastation is even worse and a 16-member medical team from California is laboring in extreme conditions to help survivors, NBC finds.

It also notes that while Clinton's favorability ratings are currently break-even, they are comparable to Obama's and better than those of potential Republican candidates. Passage 2 counters skepticism about the Democratic advantage by citing Pew research indicating that the 2014 midterms were more about turnout than a shift in public opinion. It highlights that younger voters remain predominantly Democratic and that Clinton's personal unpopularity is balanced by the lower popularity of Republican candidates. Additionally, it mentions that if the economy continues to improve, it could bolster Clinton's position. Passage 3 critiques Clinton's campaign strategy, suggesting that her reliance on virtual announcements and avoidance of direct engagement with voters may alienate her from the broader public. It argues that Clinton's association with elite circles and her fundraising approach could make her appear out of touch with the struggles of the middle class. The passage also points out that the Democratic Party faces systemic challenges related to fundraising, messaging, and policy development, which could hinder Clinton's ability to effectively communicate her vision and address voters' concerns.

The virus, which shares similarities with Ebola, has a high fatality rate ranging from 23% to 90%, depending on the outbreak. Incubation lasts 5-10 days, followed by sudden onset of symptoms such as fever, rash, and internal bleeding. Transmission occurs through direct contact with bodily fluids of infected individuals or animals, particularly fruit bats. Previous outbreaks have been contained, suggesting that the current situation is unlikely to escalate into a major outbreak. Historical data shows that Marburg outbreaks have occurred in various regions, with the most significant ones happening in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Angola, resulting in high mortality rates. Uganda has managed to contain past outbreaks effectively, indicating a robust response capability. Experimental treatments are being developed, but currently, supportive care remains the primary approach.

Key findings include the presence of a lake in Gale Crater, along with rivers and streams, indicating a period of warmth and moisture around 3.5 to 4 billion years ago, coinciding with the emergence of life on Earth. The rover detected essential elements for life, such as sulfur, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and carbon, suggesting that the environment could have supported chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms. Additionally, the rover discovered that the surface of Mars is exposed to high levels of radiation, which could have destroyed organic compounds and posed challenges for life survival. Despite these harsh conditions, the possibility remains that life could have existed in protected underground environments or during periods of lower radiation exposure. The mission highlights the complexity of searching for organic materials on Mars and underscores the importance of considering various factors, such as radiation damage and sample contamination, in the quest for definitive evidence of past or present life on the Red Planet. Furthermore, the rover's exploration of Yellowknife Bay has provided valuable insights into the planet's ancient climate and geology, reinforcing the idea that Mars was once a more hospitable world.

The hackathon, scheduled for September 20-21, 2014, brings together 150 participants including engineers, designers, parents, public health researchers, and lactation consultants to innovate and improve the design and functionality of breast pumps. The event aims to enhance maternal and neonatal health by fostering technological advancements that can save lives, reduce healthcare costs, and promote healthier and happier families. Key innovations proposed include a hands-free compression bra, a discreet and silent pump mimicking natural suckling, and a smart pump that collects data and connects users with lactation consultants. The hackathon underscores the importance of redesigning breast pumps to better support working mothers and highlights the potential for significant improvements in maternal health technology. Additionally, the event emphasizes the need for better policies to ensure women have access to private spaces for pumping at work. The hackathon also showcases the broader potential for innovation in maternal and pediatric healthcare. The organizers hope to continue fostering connections and ideas beyond the event to drive meaningful change in this field. The hackathon is supported by various sponsors and offers prizes for the most promising projects. The event also provides scholarships for attendees who work with low-income mothers to attend.

Conversely, faces perceived as less intelligent are broader, more rounded, with eyes closer together, a shorter nose, and a rounded chin. However, there was no correlation between these facial traits and actual IQ scores, suggesting that the visual cues used to assess intelligence are not based on facial shape. Additionally, the study found that perceived intelligence positively correlated with attractiveness in both men and women, but actual IQ was not significantly related to attractiveness.

Trump critics, meanwhile, say the story doesn't amount to much and accuse the White House of trying to divert attention from the president's wiretapping allegations. A look at coverage: A key story comes from Eli Lake at Bloomberg News. He reported Monday that Rice requested the identities of Trump transition officials who were mentioned, but not named, in US intelligence reports. Those reports were mostly summaries of monitored conversations between foreign officials talking about the Trump transition, but sometimes between Trump associates and foreign officials. (The National Security Council logs of Rice's requests are apparently what Rep. Devin Nunes went to the White House to view.) Lake's piece raises questions about why Rice wanted those names revealed—she didn't respond to the story—but he also notes that her requests \"were likely within the law.\" He adds that the story doesn't \"vindicate\" Trump's unsupported accusation that Obama wiretapped Trump Tower. Adam Housley of Fox News also reported on Rice's requests, and his appearance on the network prompted Trump himself to weigh in via tweet: \"Such amazing reporting on unmasking and the crooked scheme against us by @foxandfriends. 'Spied on before nomination.'

{"pred": " Scientists have found strong evidence suggesting the existence of a ninth planet in our solar system, dubbed Planet Nine. This planet is estimated to be about five to ten times the mass of Earth and orbiting far beyond Neptune's path. The evidence comes from the unusual clustering of orbits of small icy bodies in the outer solar system, which can be explained by the gravitational influence of a massive planet. The researchers, Mike Brown and Konstantin Batygin, used mathematical and computer modeling to infer the planet's existence, though it has not been directly observed yet. Brown, who previously played a role in Pluto's demotion, believes Planet Nine meets the criteria to be considered a true planet. He argues that Pluto's demotion was necessary to accurately classify celestial bodies in our solar system, and he sees the search for Planet Nine as an exciting opportunity to learn more about the outer solar system. Despite the excitement, some experts caution that more evidence is needed to confirm Planet Nine's existence. Meanwhile, the debate over Pluto's planetary status persists, with some advocating for its reinstatement and others accepting its current classification as a dwarf planet. Brown emphasizes that the focus should be on understanding the diverse range of objects in the solar system rather than rigidly adhering to traditional definitions of planets. The discovery of Planet Nine highlights ongoing efforts to refine our understanding of the solar system's structure and composition. \n\nNote: The summary integrates key points from all three passages without summarizing each passage separately, focusing on the main arguments, evidence, and unique perspectives presented regarding the potential existence of Planet Nine and the broader context of planetary classification debates.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal.

{"pred": " The Pacific coast of North America is home to a vibrant marine ecosystem supported by forage fish like Pacific sardines, which serve as a critical food source for numerous species including seabirds, whales, sharks, dolphins, and commercially important fish such as salmon and tuna. However, the sardine population is experiencing a significant decline, with the November 2013 population estimate being the lowest in over a decade. This decline is attributed to natural fluctuations influenced by ocean conditions, such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which brings cold, nutrient-rich water that is unfavorable for sardines. Despite the uncertainty surrounding the exact cause, the decline is causing substantial economic hardship for fishermen and potentially impacting the broader ecosystem. Environmental groups advocate for stricter regulations, including halting sardine fishing altogether, to prevent exacerbating the decline and facilitate recovery. The unpredictability of sardine populations underscores the need for cautious management and highlights the importance of understanding the complex interactions within marine ecosystems. Additionally, the decline in sardines has led to malnutrition among sea lion pups, indicating the far-reaching ecological impacts of this phenomenon. The Lenfest Forage Fish Task Force emphasizes the greater economic value of leaving forage fish in the water due to their role in supporting higher trophic levels. The Pacific Fishery Management Council is urged to set conservative catch limits and prohibit unregulated fishing on other forage fish species to protect the overall health of the Pacific Ocean ecosystem. \n\nThis summary integrates the key points from both passages, focusing on the ecological and economic impacts of the sardine decline, the need for careful management, and the broader implications for marine ecosystems.

One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing.

The report, which took four years and $40 million to compile, is said to criticize the CIA for misleading the Bush administration and Congress about the effectiveness of harsh interrogation techniques like waterboarding. The committee's investigation has faced significant obstacles, including allegations that the CIA monitored computers used by Senate aides to prepare the report, potentially violating an agreement between the two parties. Udall also expressed concern over the CIA withholding an internal review that corroborates the committee's findings, highlighting the need for transparency and accountability in government operations.

{"pred": " \nAntarctic notothenioid fish have evolved antifreeze proteins to prevent their blood from freezing in the frigid waters of Antarctica. However, these proteins also inhibit ice from melting, leading to a paradoxical situation where the fish carry ice crystals in their blood for most of their lives. Researchers found that even when water temperatures rise slightly above the freezing point, the ice remains stable due to the antifreeze proteins. Long-term temperature records show that summer warming in the Antarctic rarely exceeds the threshold required to melt the ice, suggesting that these fish may accumulate ice crystals throughout their lifetimes. The spleen might play a role in filtering out these ice crystals, but the long-term effects on the fish remain unclear. This discovery highlights the complex trade-offs in evolutionary adaptations, illustrating that beneficial traits can come with unforeseen drawbacks. The research underscores the intricate balance between survival mechanisms and potential health risks in extreme environments. \n\nKey Evidence: \n- Ice crystals were found to persist in the blood of notothenioid fish even when temperatures rose above the expected melting point.\n- Temperature records from McMurdo Sound indicated that summer warming rarely exceeded the threshold needed to melt the ice stabilized by antifreeze proteins.\n- Ice crystals accumulated primarily in the spleens of the fish, possibly indicating a filtration mechanism.\n- The antifreeze proteins bind to ice crystals, preventing both growth and melting, leading to a potential risk of internal ice accumulation. \n\nUnique Points: \n- The study reveals a previously unrecognized trade-off in the evolutionary adaptation of antifreeze proteins, highlighting the complexity of natural selection.\n- The concept of \"superheated ice\" occurring naturally within living organisms is a novel finding, demonstrating the unique challenges faced by species in extreme environments. \n\nThis summary integrates the main findings and innovative aspects from all three passages into a cohesive overview, emphasizing the paradoxical nature of the antifreeze proteins and their implications for the fish's survival and health.

Turns out at least some of them don't. Scientists have long known that the group of fish species known as notothenioids have an antifreeze protein in their blood that prevents them from being frozen to death, but new research has revealed that the same protein keeps ice crystals in their veins, apparently permanently, UPI reports. The crystals melted at a few degrees above freezing, but the fish may spend their whole lives without encountering temperatures that warm, according to research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The antifreeze proteins that prevented the blood from completely freezing also bound itself to the ice crystals, keeping them from getting smaller, the scientists say. Lead researcher Paul Cziko tells the Christian Science Monitor that it's not clear whether the fish have evolved some way of dealing with the ice crystals in their bodies, or if the ice ends up killing them in the long term. \"This shows that with every good evolutionary innovation, some potentially bad or unintended consequences come along with that,\" he says. \"Evolution is a stepwise process.

{"pred": " The Pacific coast of North America hosts a vibrant marine ecosystem, largely due to the presence of forage fish like Pacific sardines. However, sardine populations are experiencing a severe decline, impacting numerous species that rely on them for sustenance. The Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) is urged to set conservative catch limits on sardines and prohibit unregulated fishing on other forage fish species. The PFMC's decision is crucial as sardine populations have historically fluctuated dramatically, and their current low levels pose a threat to the ecosystem. Recent studies suggest that sardine scarcity is affecting the health of marine mammals and seabirds, with a notable increase in malnourished sea lion pups observed in 2013. Scientists are uncertain about the exact cause of the decline, but factors such as climate cycles and overfishing are under consideration. Despite the uncertainty, the consensus is that conserving sardine populations is vital for the overall health of the West Coast marine ecosystem. The PFMC's cautious approach to managing sardine fisheries reflects a broader recognition of the ecological importance of forage fish and the need to protect them from overexploitation. The decline of sardines highlights the interconnectedness of marine life and underscores the necessity of sustainable fishing practices to maintain ecosystem balance. Conservationists argue that halting sardine fishing altogether during periods of low population could aid in recovery, emphasizing the precautionary principle in fisheries management. The PFMC's actions will play a pivotal role in determining the future of the West Coast's marine biodiversity. \n\nThis summary integrates the key points from both passages, focusing on the ecological significance of sardines, the current population decline, and the urgent need for careful management by the PFMC to prevent further harm to the marine ecosystem.

One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing.

The move comes as a response to the overwhelming presence of free online pornography, making nudity in print media less relevant and commercially viable. Playboy's circulation has significantly declined from 5.6 million in the 1970s to 800,000 today. The magazine will continue to feature women in provocative poses but not in full nudity. Playboy's executives acknowledge that the magazine has been overtaken by the very changes it once spearheaded, making nudity outdated. The magazine's website has already removed nudity to gain access to social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, leading to a quadrupling of web traffic.

Luke and her legal team argue that the bill is retaliatory and that Rose died due to physical restraint by staff, as evidenced by the medical examiner's report classifying his death as a homicide. They claim that Rose was restrained in a dangerous position for up to 30 minutes by three staff members, including a significantly larger employee who sat on him, leading to his death.

His return to meat consumption was prompted by a visit to Hastings where he found himself ordering fish, followed by a craving for pepperoni pizza and bacon. The passage highlights the complexity of dietary choices and the influence of social and personal factors on dietary changes.\nPassage 2 presents a study by the Humane Research Council examining the factors influencing individuals to adopt or abandon vegetarian or vegan diets. Key findings indicate that while only 2% of the U.S. population is currently vegetarian or vegan, approximately 10% have previously adopted these diets but returned to consuming meat. The study suggests that transitioning to a vegetarian or vegan diet too quickly, lacking social support, and struggling with certain food cravings are common reasons for reverting to a meat-based diet. Advocacy efforts should focus on gradual reduction rather than complete elimination of animal products to increase adherence rates.\nPassage 4 reinforces the notion that while many people attempt to reduce their meat consumption, maintaining a fully vegetarian or vegan lifestyle is challenging, with only 1 in 5 vegetarians or vegans sustaining their diet long-term. The study reveals that a majority of former vegetarians reverted to meat consumption within a year, often citing health as their initial motivation but finding it difficult to maintain the diet due to social isolation and the challenge of adhering to strict dietary guidelines. The research underscores the importance of addressing these barriers and promoting a more flexible approach to reducing meat consumption rather than advocating for complete abstinence. \n\nOverall, these passages highlight the complexities and challenges associated with maintaining a vegetarian or vegan diet, emphasizing the need for supportive environments and gradual dietary shifts to encourage sustained behavior change.

The research also indicates that health motivations alone may not be sufficient to sustain long-term dietary changes, underscoring the importance of broader cultural and social support systems. \n\nKey evidence includes statistics showing that only 2% of the U.S. population is currently vegetarian or vegan, while 10% have previously adopted these diets but reverted to meat consumption.

(that's about 30 miles north of Boston), and 18 inches near both Gurnee, Ill., and Rochester, NY, as of early this morning, Weather Underground and the AP report. NBC News notes winter weather and wind chill warnings have been in effect in at least 22 states, affecting more than 100 million people from Chicago through the New York tri-state area into New England. Both New York and New Jersey have declared states of emergency. Along with the 2,000 flights cancelled yesterday, another 1,350 have been grounded today, according to NBC News. JFK Airport this morning suspended flights because of zero visibility; Boston's Logan is effectively non-operational as well. A meteorologist told NBC that some areas in the Midwest could see chilling temperatures not recorded since the mid-1980s. \"People that are vulnerable are really going to be hurting,\" added one. The cold could be bad news for road crews and homeowners: Snow-melting salt stops working between 10 and 20 degrees. And a second icy wave is coming, expected to hit the Midwest on Sunday and Monday then move east. It's going to be seriously cold, with an expected high in Chicago on Monday of -8. Plenty of kids are getting an extended holiday today, with schools, including all public schools in Boston and New York City, closed throughout the region.

Additionally, many North Korean women in China resort to online sex work due to financial desperation and lack of alternative employment opportunities. This practice is common among women who have been sold to Chinese husbands or are trapped in rural areas without means of communication or escape. The increased difficulty of escaping North Korea has led to higher prices for trafficked women, exacerbating their vulnerability to exploitation.

He explains that he discovered Eris, a dwarf planet more massive than Pluto, leading to the reclassification of Pluto as a dwarf planet due to the lack of a formal definition of a planet at the time. Brown emphasizes that Pluto's demotion was necessary for a more accurate understanding of the solar system. He and his colleague Konstantin Batygin have proposed the existence of a ninth planet based on the unusual orbits of distant objects in the Kuiper Belt, suggesting it is about ten times the mass of Earth and orbits far beyond Neptune. While direct observation of this planet has yet to occur, Brown believes the evidence strongly supports its existence and that it will likely be discovered within a few years. The researchers argue that this new planet would meet the criteria for planetary status and would not face the same controversy as Pluto due to its significant mass and gravitational influence on nearby objects. \n\nBrown acknowledges the emotional attachment many people have to Pluto but maintains that the scientific community should focus on the reality of the solar system rather than nostalgia. He sees the search for Planet Nine as a continuation of human exploration and discovery, reflecting the innate curiosity that drives us to understand our cosmic neighborhood better. The potential discovery of Planet Nine would represent a significant milestone in planetary science, offering insights into the formation and evolution of our solar system.

The wreck's artifacts, primarily consisting of bronze fasteners, date from a later era, leading UNESCO to reject the site. However, the organization acknowledges that the Santa Maria could be buried under coastal sediment, raising questions about the accuracy of their proposed search areas. Critics argue that UNESCO's report overlooks significant evidence, such as photographs of what could be 15th-century cannon and a 1960 expedition visit, and fails to conduct necessary tests on the site's ballast and bronze objects. Furthermore, UNESCO's decision to halt a US-led investigation and replace it with a partly European team may strain relations with the US, which has already halted financial contributions to UNESCO. Despite the rejection, the site remains a strong contender for the Santa Maria's location, with experts like Professor Beeker maintaining that further investigation is warranted.

UNESCO says the wreck is further from shore than accounts of Columbus' first voyage, and bronze or copper fasteners found at the site are evidence of shipbuilding techniques that date the ship to the late 17th or 18th century at the earliest. UNESCO says it believes the wreck may lie \"under coastal sediment\" in what is now marshland and has called for further investigation of the area. Marine archaeologist Barry Clifford, who first investigated the wreck 11 years ago, says Columbus-era lombard cannons spotted in the area are crucial pieces of evidence that now appear to have been looted from the site, the Independent reports. \"The lombards are the smoking guns and, in my view, the most important pieces of evidence in the search for the Santa Maria,\" he says.

The main argument is that Trump's victory in the 2016 election has been cast into doubt due to Russia's interference and the possibility of Trump being compromised by Russian intelligence. Key evidence includes unverified allegations contained in a dossier compiled by a former British intelligence officer, Christopher Steele, which suggested that Russian intelligence had gathered compromising information on Trump. The dossier was initially commissioned by a Republican opponent during the primaries but later shared with the FBI and Democratic operatives. The controversy has led to calls for stronger sanctions against Russia and a full investigation into Russian interference in the election. Critics argue that the situation undermines Trump's legitimacy and raises concerns about his ability to act in the best interests of the United States. Some Democrats have expressed reluctance to openly question Trump's legitimacy, fearing it could undermine confidence in American democracy. Additionally, the use of historical analogies, such as comparing the situation to the Holocaust, has been criticized as insensitive and inappropriate.

The New York Times, in a look at how the dossier came to light, reports that Steele was hired by Washington research firm Fusion GPS, which was hired by a wealthy GOP donor in the fall of 2015 to compile anti-Trump material. After Trump became the presumptive nominee, the GOP donor no longer needed the research firm's services, but wealthy Democratic donors stepped in, and Steele continued to send monthly memos detailing alleged Russian efforts to both compromise Trump and assist his campaign, per the Times' sources.

{"pred": " Recent studies have explored the ability to infer intelligence from facial appearances, revealing intriguing gender disparities. Research published in PLoS One indicates that people can predict men's intelligence through facial characteristics, but not women's. The studies involved photographing 80 university students and having another group rate these photos for intelligence and attractiveness. Key facial traits associated with perceived intelligence in men include a longer face, wider eye distance, larger nose, upward mouth corners, and a sharp chin. Conversely, lower intelligence is linked to rounder faces, closer eye distance, smaller noses, downturned mouth corners, and a rounded chin. Despite these associations, no direct correlation was found between these facial traits and actual IQ scores for either gender. The studies propose that the ability to assess men's intelligence from faces might stem from culturally ingrained stereotypes or hormonal influences during puberty, whereas women's faces may be overly judged based on attractiveness, obscuring accurate intelligence assessments. Additionally, the research highlights that fluid and figural intelligence in men correlate with perceived intelligence, suggesting these traits might be more visually discernible in males. Overall, the findings underscore the complexity of linking facial appearance to cognitive abilities and hint at potential evolutionary and social factors influencing these perceptions. \n\nNote: The summary integrates key points from all three passages without summarizing each passage separately, focusing on the core findings and implications regarding the ability to infer intelligence from facial appearances, particularly highlighting the gender differences observed.

Humboldt County has the highest per-capita rate of missing persons reports in California, with factors such as the cannabis industry, homelessness, and foster care contributing to the high numbers. The articles mention specific cases, including the disappearance of Jeff Joseph, who was involved in the cannabis industry, and Rebekah Martinez, who was reported missing but later found to be participating in the TV show \"The Bachelor\". The cases often involve challenges in investigation due to lack of cooperation, unclear circumstances, and the difficulty in distinguishing voluntary disappearances from foul play. The articles also highlight the importance of standardizing databases and the need for families to stay in close contact with law enforcement during investigations. Rebekah Martinez's case illustrates the complications that arise when a missing person is found in an unexpected situation, leading to her removal from the missing persons list after her appearance on \"The Bachelor\" was discovered. The articles emphasize the emotional toll on families and the need for continued support and investigation even in cases where leads have dried up. Unique points include the suggestion that Humboldt County's high missing persons rate may be partly due to its cannabis industry and the emphasis on the importance of community and family support in solving these cases. \n\nNote: Passage 3 and Passage 4 essentially repeat information from Passage 2, so they are summarized together.

Monis had a long history of violent crimes, including sending offensive letters to families of deceased Australian soldiers and facing multiple sexual assault charges. He was on bail for being an accessory to his ex-wife's murder. The siege began shortly after he lost a High Court bid to overturn his conviction for the offensive letters. Monis was known to authorities but was not on terror watchlists, raising questions about how he was able to carry out the attack. Prime Minister Tony Abbott questioned why Monis was not on watchlists and how he was able to obtain a gun, though he acknowledged that increased surveillance could severely disrupt daily life. Monis was described as a lone wolf, radicalized due to his grievances against the Australian government and increasing marginalization within the Islamic community.

The 31-year-old mother of two was stabbed repeatedly and set on fire with the use of lighter fluid last April, allegedly by Monis' girlfriend. The crime happened in an apartment stairwell. More: Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott says the government will look into why the 50-year-old was out on bail and why he did not appear on the country's terrorist watch list, the BBC reports. \"How can someone who has had such a long and checkered history not be on the appropriate watch lists, and how can someone like that be entirely at large in the community?\" he wondered at a press conference today. \"These are questions that we need to look at carefully and calmly and methodically.\" Just three days before he walked into the cafe with a gun and took 17 people hostage, Monis had failed in an attempt to overturn a conviction for sending \"grossly offensive\" letters to the families of Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan, reports the Sydney Morning Herald. The country's High Court rejected his application to hear a fresh constitutional challenge to the charges against him, for which he was sentenced to 300 hours of community service.

The passages also reveal that North Korean women are frequently sold to Chinese men or trapped in exploitative situations by brokers and handlers. Despite the risks, many women attempt dangerous escapes with the help of brokers and religious organizations. The U.S. State Department's Trafficking in Persons Report corroborates these findings, noting that North Korean women and girls are subjected to sexual slavery, forced prostitution, and other forms of exploitation in China. Additionally, the report highlights that the Chinese government often treats North Korean refugees as illegal migrants and repatriates them to North Korea, where they face severe punishment. The passages emphasize the vulnerability of North Korean women to trafficking and exploitation due to their lack of legal protection and limited options for survival in China. \n\nKey evidence includes Suh's personal account of her experience with online sex work and her subsequent escape, as well as the State Department's Trafficking in Persons Report detailing the widespread exploitation of North Korean women in China.

The dossier, initially commissioned by a Trump opponent during the primaries and later by Democrats, contains claims that Russia had gathered compromising information on Trump and attempted to use it to influence his behavior. Key evidence includes Steele's background as a former MI6 officer and his access to Russian sources. The documents were passed to the FBI and eventually became part of a briefing for President-elect Trump and President Obama. The media's handling of the dossier, particularly BuzzFeed's decision to publish it, sparked debate about journalistic ethics and the role of intelligence agencies in shaping public perception. Democrats grappled with how to respond to the allegations without undermining confidence in American democracy, while critics argued that the focus on Russia's interference overshadowed legitimate concerns about Trump's fitness for office. The controversy highlights tensions between partisan interests, national security concerns, and the integrity of democratic processes. \n\nNote: The passages also touch upon Trump's denial of the allegations, reactions from various political figures, and the broader context of Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Initially, she was arrested on charges of child neglect and her newborn was placed in state custody. However, after a series of legal battles, a judge ruled in her favor, allowing her to regain custody of her son Caleb, with the condition that she provide a nutritionist's report within ten days. The case highlights the conflict between parental rights and medical advice, particularly in cases involving unconventional dietary choices. The judge dismissed the claims of neglect and abuse, emphasizing that the initial disagreement was merely between a mother and a doctor.

And this is only her most recent travail: Suh and two other women interviewed by the Post were trying to flee their lives as sex \"video chatters\" in China, an online profession many women are sucked into after first escaping North Korea—either by willingly getting sold to Chinese men to get out of their home country, or after being tricked into thinking they were being hired for jobs in China, only to end up as human trafficking victims. Purchasing North Korean women is big business in China for men who can't find wives any other way: The asking price for women between 15 and 25 can near $12,000. Life in China is impoverished and dangerous for these North Korean nationals: They can be deported back to their home country if they're caught, per Radio Free Asia. North Korean women trying to survive there often fall into the online \"video chatting\" business, allowing them to bring in some extra cash from the safety of their own homes. But it's a demeaning, demoralizing trade. \"I felt so disgusting,\" Suh says. And it's what led Suh (who brought her 18-month-old daughter with her, but had to leave her 5-year-old daughter behind) and the two other women to try to escape once more—this time to Laos, then to Thailand, where they wouldn't have been able to be repatriated back to North Korea. The two women being detained with Suh want to eventually make it to South Korea, but Suh is applying for asylum instead in \"the strongest country on Earth\": the United States.

Despite initial speculation linking the decision to the pending NBC-Comcast merger, insiders suggest that negotiations had been ongoing for months. Olbermann received a generous severance package worth over $7 million, which includes a non-television work ban for less than 4.5 months. Following his exit, Olbermann hinted at a return to sports commentary through his Twitter bio, which now promotes his MLB.com Baseball Nerd blog. Meanwhile, Aaron Sorkin's interest in creating a behind-the-scenes cable news show has led to speculation that Olbermann might contribute to the project. Additionally, the passage discusses the Yankees' defensive struggles due to injuries and poor replacements, potentially impacting their performance significantly. Lastly, concerns are raised about the use of Toradol, a painkiller, among baseball players, with questions about its safety and effectiveness. \n\nNote: The summary focuses on the key points from each passage, integrating them into a cohesive overview without summarizing each passage individually.

The latest: Olbermann’s exit package was “well in excess” of $7 million, sources tell TMZ. The deal includes a clause that benches Olbermann for a while—at least when it comes to television—but sources claim he’ll only have to sit out for four-and-a-half months or less. The New York Times has a different estimate, citing executives involved in the deal: Olbermann must stay off TV for six to nine months, and can’t talk about his departure, although he can work on the Internet or in radio. His exit comes after years of behind-the-scenes conflict at MSNBC, the Times reports, noting that Jeff Zucker was one step away from firing him during his campaign contributions brouhaha in November. The usually prolific Olbermann has tweeted only once since his departure, and the message—apparently since removed—read “WATCHTHISSPACE MLB.com Baseball Nerd blog returns 2/14.” Of course, that sparked all sorts of speculation that Olbermann may return to his sports roots. But Olbermann has often promoted his Baseball Nerd blog, Mediaite notes, so the message could mean … nothing. Next up for Olbermann: Writing for TV with Aaron Sorkin?

In widely condemned remarks during the 2014 rape trial, Camp repeatedly referred to the complainant as \"the accused\" and wondered why she hadn't done more to fight off the 240-pound defendant. When she testified that the incident had been painful, Camp, who acquitted the defendant, said, \"Sex and pain sometimes go together, that's not necessarily a bad thing.\" Camp, after admitting that his thinking was \"infected\" with \"stereotypical beliefs and discredited myths,\" fought hard to keep his job, attending counseling classes and publicly apologizing to the defendant, but the Canadian Judicial Council determined that his conduct had undermined public confidence so much that he was \"incapable of executing the judicial office,\" the Globe and Mail reports. \"I would like to express my sincere apology to everyone who was hurt by my comments,\" Camp said, per CTV News.
