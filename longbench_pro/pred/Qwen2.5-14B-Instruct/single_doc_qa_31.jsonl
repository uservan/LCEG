{"pred": "The dataset was obtained from a past study done by Mathur et al. where they annotated a set of cleaned tweets obtained from Twitter for conversations happening in the Indian subcontinent. A labelled dataset for corresponding English tweets was also obtained from a study conducted by Davidson et al. This dataset was important to employ Transfer Learning to the task since the number of labeled data was very small. The obtained data set had many challenges and thus a data preparation task was employed to clean the data and make it ready for the deep learning pipeline. The challenges included messy text messages, stop words, and transliteration.
