The council ruled that Camp's conduct, which included derogatory remarks about the complainant and misconceptions about sexual assault laws, severely undermined public confidence in the judicial system. Despite Camp's efforts to salvage his career through counseling and education, the council found his actions to be so destructive of judicial impartiality and integrity that his continued presence on the bench was untenable. The case highlights the need for ongoing judicial training on gendered issues and underscores the importance of maintaining public trust in the justice system. Similar incidents, such as a recent Nova Scotia judge's acquittal of a taxi driver based on the notion that \"a drunk can consent,\" further emphasize the necessity for improved judicial understanding and sensitivity in handling sexual assault cases. The resignation of Camp marks a significant moment in addressing gender biases within the Canadian judicial system. \n\nKey evidence includes the transcript of Camp's trial where he repeatedly referred to the complainant as \"the accused,\" questioned her attire and behavior, and suggested that pain and sex sometimes go together. The complainant testified that these comments made her feel hated and degraded. Despite Camp's subsequent efforts to rectify his behavior, the council deemed his actions irredeemable, emphasizing the need for judges to understand and respect the vulnerabilities of sexual assault survivors. The case also prompted calls for mandatory judicial training on sexual assault and gender-based violence. The resignation of Camp signifies a pivotal shift towards addressing and rectifying systemic biases in the judicial system. \n\nUnique points include the unprecedented lengths Camp went to retain his position, including undergoing extensive counseling and appearing before the judicial council, and the council's unanimous decision to recommend his removal despite his efforts to rehabilitate himself. The case also sparked broader discussions about the need for continuous judicial education and the importance of public confidence in the justice system.

The siege ended with the deaths of Monis and two hostages, raising questions about why Monis was not on terror watchlists and how he obtained a gun.

The incident highlighted the challenges of identifying and preventing lone wolf attacks in open democracies. Monis had posted extremist messages online and converted to Sunni Islam, but there was no evidence linking him to organized terrorist groups. The siege also drew attention to the use of retention incentives by the Bureau of Prisons to retain staff, with expenditures increasing from $10.7 million in 2012 to $14 million in 2016.

The refined measurements were achieved by precisely gauging distances to faraway galaxies using Cepheid variable stars and Type Ia supernovae, improving the accuracy of cosmic yardsticks. The findings imply that the universe's expansion could be influenced by unknown subatomic particles, peculiar properties of dark matter, or an evolving strength of dark energy, highlighting the complexity and mysteries of the universe's dark components.

For the record, they calculate the rate to be 45.5 miles per second per megaparsec, the latter being the equivalent of 3.26 million light-years.

{"pred": " \nResearch indicates that having an older father may confer certain advantages to offspring, particularly in terms of cognitive abilities and academic performance. Studies using data from thousands of twins found that boys with older fathers tend to score higher on a \"geek index\" which measures traits like high IQ, strong focus on subjects of interest, and social aloofness. This geek index was predictive of better academic achievement, especially in STEM subjects. The effect was stronger in boys than girls, possibly due to a female protective factor against autism which may also shield girls from certain geeky traits. While older paternal age has been linked to increased risk of autism and schizophrenia, the findings suggest there may be some positive genetic effects passed on to children of older fathers that contribute to cognitive strengths. The exact mechanisms behind these effects remain unclear but could involve both familial genetic factors and de novo mutations that accumulate in paternal sperm with age. The results highlight the complex and multifaceted nature of the impacts of advanced paternal age on offspring outcomes. \n\nKey evidence includes studies of over 15,000 twins showing a correlation between paternal age and higher geek index scores in boys, with older fathers conferring a slight but statistically significant advantage. The geek index was found to be strongly predictive of future academic attainment and educational success, particularly in STEM fields. The effect was more pronounced in males, with no clear benefit seen for girls. The findings suggest a potential phenotypic advantage in the offspring of older fathers, though the exact nature and extent of this advantage remains to be fully characterized. Overall, the research sheds new light on the diverse impacts of paternal age on offspring traits and outcomes. The results challenge simplistic views of older fatherhood as uniformly detrimental and point to more nuanced effects that may have both positive and negative dimensions. The study highlights the need for further research to fully understand the complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors underlying these phenomena. \n\nInnovative points include defining a composite \"geek index\" to measure traits associated with academic and career success, and examining the effects of paternal age on this index in a large population-based sample of twins. The study also explored the genetic and environmental contributions to the geek index and its association with paternal age, using advanced statistical modeling techniques. The findings raise intriguing questions about the evolutionary origins and modern-day implications of the effects of advanced paternal age on offspring traits.

And as the current SI article notes, he didn't go back to his hometown of Bernice, La., or keep in touch with teammates or relatives. Instead, he became what SI says was \"a jheri-curled version of a phantom.\" \"It's like he turned the lights out on his existence,\" an ex-Houston player says in the documentary. But Rives, with the help of former teammate and ex-Chicago cop Eric Davis, followed a bunch of leads until they tracked him down in a rental apartment outside of Detroit. The SI reveal doesn't tell much about Anders' current state of affairs, other than noting he works in a local restaurant and \"looks good … weighing far less than 350 pounds, as was rumored.\" Fans will have to wait for the ESPN movie to find out more.

With accusations that Get Hard is homophobic and racist, Ferrell defends the flick to the AP, noting he and costar Kevin Hart \"show a mirror to what's already existing out there.\" Do critics agree? \"Perhaps there's an edgy dark comedy to be made about race, class, and the prospect of facing prison, but Get Hard is not it,\" Claudia Puig writes at USA Today. The film's \"jokes are a cavalcade of racist and homophobic humorlessness.\" And though its cracks at class divisions perform better, they aren't worth the price of a movie ticket. Her advice: \"Unless you're really hard up for entertainment, stay away from this tone-deaf raunchfest.\" It \"seeks to make you laugh while also risking offense by going too far. It succeeds on both counts,\" writes Peter Howell more favorably at the Toronto Star. The film will undoubtedly offend a portion of the audience, but \"I enjoyed it because, unlike similar films of its ilk, everybody is in on the joke,\" he writes: white, black; rich, poor; etc. \"It's not great cinema, but it's also not just a scattershot of dumbness and vulgarity.\" And \"Ferrell and Hart make a good team.\" Cary Darling at DFW is less kind. \"Since anyone who has seen the trailer has already seen many of the film's best moments, making it through to the end does feel like something of a life sentence,\" she writes. Excepting a scene in which Hart portrays a black guy, a Latino guy, and a gay black guy within a matter of minutes, the film just doesn't bring the laughs. Instead, it's \"weighed down by middle-school jokes.\" At its best, Get Hard \"does a smartly scathing job\" of attacking privilege and entitlement, writes Ann Hornaday at the Washington Post. At its worst, it \"veers perilously close to committing the very sins it aspires to criticize.\" Particularly, \"the movie is drenched in gay panic\" and includes \"tiresome 'don't drop the soap' jokes,\" based on Ferrell's character's fears about being raped in prison. At least \"Ferrell and Hart have a genial, easygoing chemistry,\" Hornaday writes."], "length": 27724}

{"pred": " The practice of plural marriage in the Latter-day Saints church was introduced by Joseph Smith in the early 1840s after receiving a revelation from God. This principle was rooted in biblical times when God commanded some of His people to practice plural marriage. The revelation also taught that marriage could last beyond death and that eternal marriage was essential to inheriting the fulness that God desires for His children. The practice was initially kept confidential and gradually introduced among the early Saints. Joseph Smith married multiple wives and authorized other members to do the same. The practice was challenging for all involved, especially for Joseph Smith and his wife Emma. Despite the controversy and opposition, many members testified of powerful spiritual experiences that helped them overcome their hesitation and accept the practice. Plural marriage resulted in an increased number of children born to believing parents and was seen as a redemptive process of sacrifice and spiritual refinement. However, the church no longer practices plural marriage today, and members are encouraged to trust in their wise Heavenly Father. The precise nature of relationships in the next life remains unknown, but members are permitted to perform ordinances on behalf of deceased men and women who married more than once on earth. The introduction of plural marriage in Nauvoo did indeed \"raise up seed\" unto God, and a substantial number of today's members descend from faithful Latter-day Saints who practiced plural marriage. The practice was discontinued in 1890 after Church President Wilford Woodruff issued the Manifesto, which led to the end of plural marriage in the Church. The exact number of women Joseph Smith was sealed to is unknown due to fragmentary evidence, but most were between 20 and 40 years of age at the time of their sealing to him. Some of these sealings were for eternity alone, while others were for time and eternity. The reasons for these sealings are not entirely clear, but they may have provided a way to create an eternal bond between Joseph's family and other families within the Church, or they may have been an early version of linking one family to another. The practice of plural marriage was difficult for all involved, and many aspects of Joseph and Emma's story remain known only to the two of them. Despite the challenges, the introduction of plural marriage in Nauvoo did indeed \"raise up seed\" unto God, and a substantial number of today's members descend from faithful Latter-day Saints who practiced plural marriage.

The essay explains that Smith was ordered to take multiple wives by an angel who visited him three times between 1834 and 1842; in the last instance, the angel was armed with a sword and threatened a reluctant Smith. The leader, then married to first wife Emma, took his first plural wife, Fanny Alger, in Kirtland, Ohio. Smith and Alger ultimately separated, and the church relocated to Nauvoo, Ill., where he married many more women. The oldest was 56, and the youngest was 14-year-old Helen Mar Kimball; some were already married, a revelation the New York Times describes as the \"biggest bombshell for some.\" The essay explains that a number of marriages, including that with Kimball, were sealed \"for eternity alone,\" suggesting sexual relations weren't involved (the ones that did involve sex were \"for time and eternity\"). What did Emma think of all this? Per the essay, she was none too pleased, though at one time she did accept four of Smith's wives into their home. And what was the reasoning behind what the essay describes as the \"wrenching trial\" of polygamy? Kimball said Smith told her that \"the practice of this principle would be the hardest trial the Saints would ever have to test their faith.\" Two more essays discuss plural marriage in the church's later years; they're part of an effort the church is making to share \"reliable, faith-promoting\" info about its past, the church's historian tells the Times.

Meanwhile, in July 2014, Sonoma County District Attorney Jill Ravitch announced that no criminal charges would be filed against Deputy Erick Gelhaus, who shot and killed Lopez. Her decision was based on the belief that Gelhaus acted within legal parameters, fearing for his life when he perceived Lopez's toy gun as a real firearm. However, the community reacted with outrage, viewing the shooting as unjustified police violence. New evidence revealed that Lopez had marijuana in his system, potentially affecting his behavior. Despite the lack of criminal charges, the Lopez family pursued a federal civil rights lawsuit against Gelhaus and the county.

{"pred": " Researchers have developed a brain-computer interface (BCI) system using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) that enables patients with complete locked-in syndrome (CLIS) due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) to communicate by answering 'yes' or 'no'. Four patients, ranging from 24 to 76 years old, were trained to use the system, which detects changes in oxygenated hemoglobin (O2Hb) levels in the brain in response to auditory questions. The BCI system achieved above-chance-level correct response rates over 70%, enabling patients to respond to personal questions and open-ended inquiries about their quality of life. Notably, all patients indicated they were happy with their lives despite their condition. This breakthrough suggests that CLIS may no longer render individuals completely communicationless and opens avenues for further improving BCI technology to facilitate proactive communication for these patients. The findings challenge preconceived notions about the quality of life for locked-in patients and highlight the potential of fNIRS-based BCIs for enhancing the lives of those with severe motor paralysis. Adrian Owen, a neuroscientist, commends the study's approach and sees promise in expanding the use of fNIRS for communication with other brain-injured patients. The research underscores the importance of continued exploration into innovative technologies that can bridge the gap between locked-in patients and the outside world. \n\nKey Evidence: \n- Four patients with CLIS due to ALS were trained to use the fNIRS-based BCI system.\n- The system achieved above-chance-level correct response rates over 70% for 'yes' or 'no' answers.\n- Patients could respond to personal questions and open-ended inquiries about their quality of life.\n- All patients indicated they were happy with their lives despite their condition.\n- The BCI system relies on detecting changes in O2Hb levels in the brain in response to auditory questions.\n- The technology offers hope for abolishing complete locked-in states, at least for ALS patients. \n\nUnique Points:\n- The use of fNIRS to detect brain activity changes for communication in CLIS patients.\n- The finding that all patients reported being happy with their lives despite their condition.\n- The potential for expanding the use of fNIRS-based BCIs to other brain-injured patients. \n\nInnovative Approach:\n- Developing a BCI system that can be used by patients in CLIS, a condition where traditional BCIs have failed.\n- Utilizing fNIRS to detect brain activity changes,", "answers": ["Four paralyzed patients unable to communicate for years were finally able to do so through a potentially groundbreaking brain-reading system.

In other words, they had \"locked-in syndrome,\" meaning total motor paralysis in spite of normal cognitive and emotional processing. Researchers at the University of Tübingen in Germany fitted the patients with caps through which they could observe changes in blood flow in different parts of the brain, they explain in the journal PLOS Biology. They first asked the patients to think yes or no in response to simple statements such as their spouse's name, and moved on to more personal questions when that was mastered. “It’s the first sign that completely locked-in syndrome may be abolished forever, because with all of these patients, we can now ask them the most critical questions in life,” says researcher Niels Birbaumer. The patients, all of whom are on ventilators and being cared for at home, range in age from 24 to 76. The team did stumble on a couple surprises. For instance, all four patients suggested they were \"happy\" with their lives in spite of being locked-in. (Birmbaumer suggests this might be because of something akin to meditation.) And one patient, who is 61, answered \"no\" nine times out of 10 when his 26-year-old daughter asked if she should marry her boyfriend Mario. \"But they got married,\" one of the researchers tells the BBC. \"Nothing can come between love.\" (Researchers can't explain how Stephen Hawking has lived this long.)"], "length": 27987}

The investigation began when 11,000 pieces of mail were found in a Michigan ravine, traced back to Block's assigned routes. Block admitted to investigators that he paid a friend to burn mail he couldn't deliver and hid another 6,000 pieces at home. Evidence showed he engaged in this behavior for months starting in summer 2016. Block resigned from his job and no accomplice has been formally charged yet. The incident highlights the potential for abuse of power and the importance of thorough investigations in postal services.

The case also highlights the critical role of anonymous tip-offs in uncovering such misconduct. Overall, the incident serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of neglecting duties and the necessity of stringent measures to safeguard the postal system's reliability and trustworthiness. The summary integrates information from multiple sources to provide a comprehensive overview of the event, its implications, and the investigative process. The unique aspect of the case is the innovative use of a posterior approach for fitting the headgear on pets, which is designed to reduce the anxiety and resistance typically associated with such restraints. This approach aims to enhance the safety and comfort of both the pet and the handler, promoting a more positive interaction and facilitating necessary procedures without causing undue stress to the animal. The clamshell design with a hinge at the caudal end and a fastener at the rostral end allows for secure and gentle application, ensuring the pet is unaware of the impending restraint until it is safely in place. This design innovation addresses a significant gap in pet restraint solutions, offering a humane and practical alternative to existing products. The clamshell headgear also includes optional pleasant sensory zones (PSZs) that can deliver calming stimuli to the pet, further enhancing its acceptance and reducing stress. The PSZs can incorporate various sensory inputs such as pheromones, flavors, sounds, or tactile sensations, tailored to the specific needs and preferences of different pets.

Erin refused a blood alcohol test and her bail was set at $100,000. She was reportedly \"out of control\" and \"just out of it\". Erin's latest screen credit is a sex tape. Later, a major Hollywood movie studio cracked down on the use of images from the 1988 Pippi Longstocking film to promote the sex tape on websites, sending cease and desist letters and warning of lawsuits. The pornographic websites complied by removing most images and links, but still included many Pippi references and a screenshot from the original movie featuring the 14-year-old Erin. The studio added a disclaimer stating the sex tape is not affiliated with the studio.

{"pred": " A new study challenges the longstanding practice of routinely removing cancerous lymph nodes from breast cancer patients, revealing that for approximately 20% of patients, this procedure offers no survival benefits and can lead to complications like infection and lymphedema. The study, involving 891 patients, showed no significant difference in overall survival or disease-free survival between those who underwent complete axillary lymph node dissection and those who did not, after receiving chemotherapy and radiation. This finding, combined with previous research, suggests a shift in medical practice, though widespread adoption may take time due to deeply ingrained beliefs. Additionally, the study highlights the evolving understanding of breast cancer, emphasizing the importance of systemic therapies over radical surgeries for managing the disease. Another study, the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 trial, similarly found that among patients with clinical T1-T2 breast cancer and a positive sentinel lymph node, axillary lymph node dissection did not significantly affect overall or disease-free survival when treated with lumpectomy, adjuvant systemic therapy, and tangential-field whole-breast radiation therapy. This trial underscores the high rate of locoregional control achievable with modern multimodal therapy, even without axillary lymph node dissection, and suggests that the morbidity associated with the procedure may outweigh any potential benefits. Both studies advocate for a reevaluation of standard local therapy practices in breast cancer management. \n\nThe key evidence includes the 6.3-year median follow-up of the Z0011 trial, showing no significant difference in survival rates between the two groups, and the observation that the morbidity from axillary lymph node dissection is substantial, with higher rates of wound infections, axillary seromas, and lymphedema in the dissection group. Innovatively, these studies challenge the conventional wisdom that more aggressive surgical interventions are necessary for optimal breast cancer treatment, suggesting that less invasive approaches can achieve comparable outcomes with fewer adverse effects. These findings could significantly impact clinical practice, potentially improving quality of life for thousands of women annually. \n\nIn conclusion, these studies collectively argue for a shift towards less invasive surgical practices in breast cancer treatment, highlighting the efficacy of modern systemic therapies and the risks associated with traditional surgical interventions. They advocate for a more nuanced approach to treatment decisions, considering both the potential benefits and drawbacks of each intervention.

Marburg virus, like Ebola, is a hemorrhagic fever with a fatality rate ranging from 23% to 90%, depending on the outbreak. It is transmitted through direct contact with bodily fluids of infected individuals or animals, primarily fruit bats and primates. Historical outbreaks have occurred in various regions, including Germany, Yugoslavia, Kenya, Angola, and Uganda.

A citizen, William Brennan, filed a complaint alleging that Christie knew about the closures while they were happening and failed to stop them, constituting second-degree official misconduct. Despite Christie's repeated denials of knowledge, testimony from key witness David Wildstein suggests Christie was informed during the closures.

He portrays El Chapo as a pragmatic businessman rather than a ruthless criminal, and reflects on the failure of the War on Drugs. In Passage 4 and 5, Penn disputes claims made in a Netflix documentary series about his role in facilitating the meeting with El Chapo, asserting that he never alerted the Department of Justice about the encounter.

Penn's representatives argue that the documentary's narrative is false and reckless, while Broome maintains that the series does not claim Penn was in cahoots with the DOJ.

It was seen as a commandment from God, though its exact implementation was not detailed. The practice was initially kept secret due to societal and legal opposition, but eventually became public knowledge. Plural marriage was viewed as a means to increase the number of children born into the faith and to create eternal familial bonds. It was also seen as a test of faith and obedience. Joseph Smith himself participated in both sealings for time and eternity and for eternity alone, with the exact number of wives unknown due to incomplete records. The practice was controversial and difficult for many members, especially Joseph's wife Emma, who struggled with the concept. Despite the challenges, many participants found spiritual growth and peace through the practice. The church ceased practicing plural marriage in 1890 after the issuance of the Manifesto by President Wilford Woodruff. Today, the church permits sealing to multiple spouses for eternity in proxy ordinances for deceased individuals. The practice of plural marriage remains a sensitive and complex topic within the church's history. The key evidence includes testimonies from participants and historical records, though many details remain uncertain due to the secretive nature of the practice during its active period. The unique point made is the emphasis on the spiritual and eternal aspects of the practice, rather than purely temporal or social motivations.

The practice of plural marriage was a significant and challenging aspect of the church's history, reflecting the belief in the restoration of ancient principles and the importance of obedience to divine commandments.

The essay explains that Smith was ordered to take multiple wives by an angel who visited him three times between 1834 and 1842; in the last instance, the angel was armed with a sword and threatened a reluctant Smith. The leader, then married to first wife Emma, took his first plural wife, Fanny Alger, in Kirtland, Ohio. Smith and Alger ultimately separated, and the church relocated to Nauvoo, Ill., where he married many more women. The oldest was 56, and the youngest was 14-year-old Helen Mar Kimball; some were already married, a revelation the New York Times describes as the \"biggest bombshell for some.\" The essay explains that a number of marriages, including that with Kimball, were sealed \"for eternity alone,\" suggesting sexual relations weren't involved (the ones that did involve sex were \"for time and eternity\"). What did Emma think of all this? Per the essay, she was none too pleased, though at one time she did accept four of Smith's wives into their home.

{"pred": " At the Cannes Lions advertising festival, Michael Wolff, author of \"Fire and Fury\", criticized Mike Pence's boring personality and predicted a bleak future for the media industry if Pence becomes president. Wolff's book on Trump's presidency has been highly successful, selling over 2 million hard copies in the US since its release. The book's success was partly attributed to the controversy surrounding it, including the White House's attempt to stop its publication. \n\nRegarding Mike Pence's relationship with his wife Karen, there are accounts of him addressing her as \"Mother\" during public events, which has garnered significant attention. This peculiar habit reflects Pence's traditional values and conservative demeanor. Pence's approach to governance as Indiana's governor was characterized by his strong stance on social issues, often prioritizing ideological purity over practical solutions. Examples include his handling of the HIV outbreak in Scott County, where he delayed implementing needle exchange programs, and his reluctance to accept federal funding for pre-K education. His decision to sign the controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) and his response to the ensuing backlash demonstrated his tendency to prioritize conservative principles over economic and social consequences. Additionally, Pence's administration was criticized for its slow reaction to the lead contamination crisis in East Chicago, despite being aware of the severity of the situation. Overall, Pence's tenure as governor highlighted his commitment to conservative values at the expense of broader societal needs. \n\nDuring his time as governor, Pence faced criticism for his handling of various crises and his rigid adherence to conservative ideologies, which sometimes conflicted with practical governance. His decision-making often reflected a preference for ideological purity over pragmatic solutions, leading to negative impacts on vulnerable populations and the state's economy. Despite these challenges, Pence's strong stance on social issues and his unwavering commitment to conservative values positioned him as a viable candidate for the vice presidency under Donald Trump. His role in the Trump administration is expected to be influential, particularly on social issues, although his effectiveness and ethical considerations remain uncertain. \n\nIn summary, the passages highlight Mike Pence's unique relationship with his wife, his conservative governance style as Indiana's governor, and the potential implications of his role in the Trump administration. His decisions often prioritized ideological purity over practical outcomes, leading to mixed reviews of his tenure and raising questions about his future impact on national policy.

Besides the increased risk of suicide attempts, those bereaved by suicide were also 80% more likely to drop out of education or work, with 8% dropping out of an educational course or job since the death.

{"pred": " The FBI and Justice Department have launched a major review of thousands of criminal cases to determine if flawed forensic evidence led to wrongful convictions. This review stems from revelations that flawed forensic hair analysis might have contributed to the convictions of hundreds of potentially innocent people since the 1970s. The FBI's microscopic hair comparison unit, which testified in cases nationwide involving murder, rape, and other violent felonies, has been found to have overstated forensic matches in nearly every case reviewed. The review includes 2,600 convictions and 45 death-row cases from the 1980s and 1990s, with findings troubling the bureau and prompting a halt to the review last August. However, the review resumed this month after criticism from the Justice Department's inspector general. The review highlights the failure of the U.S. justice system to address systematic weaknesses in past forensic testimony and methods, and raises questions about how many more wrongful convictions may exist. The FBI has acknowledged that hair examiners until 2012 lacked written standards defining scientifically appropriate and erroneous ways to explain results in court. The review underscores the need for improved standards and transparency in forensic science to prevent future miscarriages of justice. Additionally, Cleveland Wright has requested a D.C. Court judge to clear his name after new DNA test results in 2012 exonerated his co-defendant in two similar 1978 murders, illustrating the ongoing impact of these flawed forensic practices. The review also emphasizes the importance of notifying defendants about errors in their cases and allowing them to seek new DNA testing if desired. Overall, the review represents a significant step towards addressing longstanding issues in forensic evidence and ensuring fairer outcomes in criminal cases. The review's findings highlight the need for rigorous scrutiny of forensic evidence and the importance of ensuring that defendants are notified of any flaws in their cases. The review also underscores the need for improved standards and transparency in forensic science to prevent future wrongful convictions.

Of these, 11 tested negative for the virus, while the rest are being monitored. The Marburg virus, first identified in 1967, causes symptoms similar to Ebola, including fever, weakness, and sometimes internal or external bleeding, with a death rate ranging from 23% to 90%. Uganda's health authorities have implemented stringent safety protocols, including SUBSAFE certification, to prevent and respond to such incidents. President Museveni highlighted the importance of job creation through industries like leather processing and emphasized the need for import substitution and export promotion. He also stressed the necessity of improving the army's equipment, relaunching the national airline, and increasing funds for wealth creation initiatives. Historical data indicates that Marburg outbreaks have occurred sporadically, with notable cases in Germany/Yugoslavia in 1967, South Africa/Zimbabwe in 1975, Kenya in 1980 and 1987, Russia in 1990, Democratic Republic of Congo in 1998-2000, Angola in 2004-2005, Uganda in 2007 and 2012, and the USA/Netherlands in 2008. The virus is transmitted through direct contact with bodily fluids of infected individuals or contaminated objects. Initial symptoms include sudden fever, chills, headache, and muscle pain, followed by a rash, nausea, vomiting, and other severe symptoms. Diagnosis can be challenging due to similarities with other diseases, and the fatality rate ranges from 23% to 90%, depending on the outbreak. Uganda has successfully managed previous outbreaks and has the capacity to handle this current situation. The country's health officials have put in place rigorous surveillance and control measures to prevent further spread. President Museveni's emphasis on youth and women empowerment through livelihood programs underscores the government's commitment to fostering economic growth and stability. The Marburg virus poses a significant public health threat due to its high mortality rate and the difficulty in diagnosing it early.

Many North Korean women are sold to Chinese husbands or forced into sex work, often resorting to online chatting to make ends meet due to harsh living conditions and lack of other job opportunities. These women face severe risks, including repatriation to North Korea and imprisonment, if caught working outside their residences. The tightening of security in North Korea has driven up prices for trafficked women, leading to increased exploitation and abuse. Despite the dangers, some women attempt dangerous escapes, risking their lives to seek freedom and a better future for their children. The U.S. has accepted a small number of North Korean refugees, but the overall situation remains dire for many North Korean women trapped in exploitative situations in China. The passages shed light on the desperate circumstances facing North Korean women and the urgent need for better protections and escape routes. The stories of individual women like Suh illustrate the human toll of these systemic issues.

The study analyzed data from 3,432 UK university staff and students aged 18-40 who had experienced sudden bereavement. Key findings indicate that those bereaved by suicide were also 80% more likely to drop out of education or work. Importantly, the study revealed that perceived social stigma around the death could exacerbate these outcomes, suggesting that addressing stigma might mitigate the impact of suicide bereavement. Additionally, the research underscores the need for support not only for those bereaved by family members but also for friends and non-blood relatives, as the risk extends beyond genetic ties. The study's methodology, involving a large population-based sample and precise sampling frame, enhances its credibility and relevance, although it acknowledges limitations such as potential selection and non-response biases. These findings emphasize the importance of considering suicide bereavement in broader suicide prevention strategies and highlight the necessity for targeted interventions to address stigma and improve mental health outcomes. Furthermore, the study's innovative approach in distinguishing between different types of sudden bereavement provides valuable insights into the specific risks associated with suicide bereavement. Overall, the research calls for a more inclusive and nuanced approach to supporting those affected by suicide. \n\nNote: The summary integrates key points from all three passages into a cohesive narrative, focusing on the main conclusions, evidence, and innovative aspects of the study.

They found that individuals whose deceased loved ones had killed themselves were 65% more likely to attempt suicide themselves (what NDTV refers to as the phenomenon of \"suicide contagion\") than those affected by a loved one's sudden death by natural causes—or 1 in 10 people in that segment, per a press release.

She explains that she closely monitors public perception of her but avoids reading about herself online to maintain her sanity. Swift denies that \"Bad Blood\" is about Katy Perry, stating that she intentionally diverted attention away from a specific person to protect an ex-boyfriend. She also discusses how she handles criticism, such as from Grizzly Bear's Ed Droste, by framing her meticulous planning as a positive trait rather than a negative one. Swift emphasizes her strategic approach to her career and personal life, highlighting her deliberate choices in friendships and public image. Critics argue that her responses and actions often reinforce the perception of her as calculated, despite her efforts to portray herself as thoughtful and self-aware. The articles also touch on Swift's experiences with loneliness and her complex relationship with fame and public scrutiny. Overall, Swift presents herself as a deeply self-aware artist who carefully manages her image and career, while critics suggest that her calculated approach may be more apparent than she acknowledges.

Antarctica was losing around 49 billion tons of ice a year in the mid-1990s, which went up to an average 219 billion tons a year between 2012 and 2017, the study found. The researchers, who used satellite data going back more than 25 years, say most of the melting ice comes from the West Antarctic sheet, parts of which are in a \"state of collapse\"—and modest ice growth in the East Antarctic is nowhere near enough to offset it. \"The increasing mass loss that they’re finding is really worrying, particularly looking at the West Antarctic, the area that’s changing most rapidly,\" University of Waterloo glaciologist Christine Dow tells the Washington Post. \"And it’s the area that we’re most worried about, because it’s below sea level.\" Antarctica has lost a total of around 3 trillion tons of ice since 1992 and will be contributing more and more to sea level rise if the current trend continues, warn researchers, who say climate change is the only plausible explanation for the ice loss. \"I think we should be worried.

Facebook initially asked Khanna to remove the extension and then rescinded his internship offer, citing violations of user agreements. However, Khanna argued that the data was publicly accessible and not malicious. The incident sparked discussions on privacy, transparency, and the role of insiders versus outsiders in exposing corporate practices. Meanwhile, the Navy faces persistent and costly maintenance delays for its attack submarines, leading to significant idle time and operating costs. Between fiscal years 2008 and 2018, the Navy incurred over $1.5 billion in costs due to delays and idle time. Delays are primarily driven by workforce shortages and limited shipyard capacity, particularly at public shipyards. The Navy has started addressing these issues but lacks a comprehensive business case analysis to allocate maintenance periods between public and private shipyards efficiently. This oversight hinders full utilization of private shipyard capacity and increases costs. The Navy's SUBSAFE program ensures stringent safety standards for submarines, but maintenance delays pose risks to operational readiness and availability. The SUBSAFE program has been successful in preventing losses since its inception in 1963, but the Navy needs to address maintenance challenges to maintain high levels of readiness and avoid unnecessary costs.

{"pred": " \nIn a study examining sexist behavior in online environments, researchers found that lower-skilled male players in a first-person shooter video game were more hostile towards female-voiced teammates, while higher-skilled players were more positive. This behavior was linked to evolutionary theories of intra-sexual competition, suggesting that lower-status males perceive female competitors as a threat to their social standing and attempt to suppress their influence. Conversely, higher-status males, having less to lose, adopt more supportive behaviors towards women, potentially as a strategy to attract them. The study highlights the importance of considering evolutionary perspectives in understanding sexist behavior and suggests that addressing this issue could involve teaching young males to cope better with losing to the opposite sex in competitive contexts. The research underscores the unique insights that video games can provide into inter-sexual competition and the factors that trigger sexist behavior. \n\nKey evidence includes the observation that lower-skilled players increased negative comments towards female teammates as their own performance worsened, while higher-skilled players were more positive. The study utilized Halo 3, an online multiplayer game, where players' identities were anonymous, allowing for honest expression of behavior without fear of retribution. This ecological design provided a realistic context for observing sexist behavior, avoiding biases seen in traditional lab settings.

The study gauged a remote player's skill by measuring such factors like kills and deaths. Researchers found men were typically cordial to players they believed to be male, and that more skilled men who kicked first-shooter butt were less likely to direct negative comments toward female-voiced players than their less skilled male counterparts. But lamer players tended to take their frustrations out on female players with more frequent, caustic comments.

Females threaten gamers' \"pre-existing social hierarchy\"; the guys at the bottom of the virtual totem pole feel threatened and therefore become more threatening to those they think they can quash the easiest. \"As men often rely on aggression to maintain their dominant social status, the increase in hostility towards a woman by lower-status males may be an attempt to disregard a female's performance and suppress her disturbance on the hierarchy to retain their social rank,\" the study notes.

{"pred": " \nSenator Bernie Sanders is proposing a \"Medicare for All\" bill to establish a single-payer health care system in the United States, arguing that it would provide universal coverage and eliminate out-of-pocket costs for medical services. However, the bill faces significant political hurdles, with many Democratic leaders and vulnerable incumbents opting not to support it due to concerns about its feasibility and potential costs. While some liberal senators and potential 2020 presidential candidates have endorsed the bill, others are advocating for incremental reforms that expand access to government-run health insurance without fully implementing a single-payer system. Critics argue that the Sanders plan would be too costly and disruptive to the current health care landscape, while proponents contend that it represents a necessary step towards achieving universal coverage. The bill aims to gradually phase out private health insurance over four years, starting with expanding Medicare coverage and lowering the eligibility age. Despite its uncertain prospects in Congress, the proposal has gained traction among the public and within the Democratic Party, reflecting a broader shift towards more expansive health care policies.

Sanders calls it the Medicare for All Act of 2017, but you'll also hear phrases such as \"single payer\" and \"universal health care\" used to describe it. One key part missing: details on how to pay for it, though Sanders plans to release a separate paper on that, reports the Wall Street Journal. Coverage: The basics: Per CNN, everybody gets a \"Universal Medicare card,\" which would be used to cover all health bills, from surgeries to dental care to substance abuse treatment. Co-payments would go away, and people would pay premiums based on their incomes, reports the AP. Private insurers would still exist, but for things such as elective plastic surgery or, sometimes, to act as middlemen between the government and hospitals or doctors. A 'right': Sanders makes his case in an op-ed in the New York Times. \"Guaranteeing health care as a right is important to the American people not just from a moral and financial perspective; it also happens to be what the majority of the American people want.\" 'Single payer': David Leonhardt of the New York Times has a Q&A on the fundamentals, including the basic question of what the term \"single payer\" means. In short, it \"describes a system in which only one entity—the government—pays medical bills. If all Americans had Medicare rather than insurance through their jobs, it would be a single-payer system.\" Vox says Sanders' system is far more generous than single-payer plans in Canada and elsewhere. The cost: This could cost hundreds of billions of dollars more per year, per the Journal. Details are yet to come, but Sanders envisions a progressive tax increase, with the wealthy paying more income, capital gains, and estate taxes, reports Newsweek. The senator says higher taxes for families would be offset by the fact that they no longer have to buy insurance. Still, in regard to single-payer systems, \"no one—including Sanders—has truly reckoned with how to pay for whatever system they might support,\" writes Mike Allen at Axios. Litmus test? By all accounts, the chances of it passing a GOP-controlled Congress are precisely 0%. But it's turning into a political litmus test of sorts for Democrats, reports the Washington Post. Sanders has the support of 15 Democratic senators so far, including all of those seen as potential 2020 presidential candidates. Co-sponsors include Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand, Cory Booker, and Kamala Harris. But many prominent Democrats are not on board, at least yet, including Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and those in tough re-election fights, reports Politico. The politics: No, this isn't going to pass, \"but here's the big question,\" writes Perry Bacon Jr. at FiveThirtyEight. \"Is it going to become one of the central goals of the Democratic Party and a defining feature of the campaign of whichever Democrat is the party's nominee in 2020?\" As of now, this \"seems very likely,\" as the Democratic party seems to be gravitating to the left. But Bacon lays out the political and policy reasons why Democrats might avoid \"becoming the party of single payer.\" Relishing the fight: Republicans see a chance to pounce. \"We welcome the Democrats' strategy of moving even further left,\" says Katie Martin, spokesperson for the Senate GOP's campaign organization, per the AP."], "length": 27056}

{"pred": " Researchers Michael Kasumovic and Jeffrey Kuznekoff studied sexist behavior in online environments, particularly in the context of the video game Halo 3. They found that lower-skilled male players were more hostile towards female players, while higher-skilled male players were more positive. This behavior was linked to the threat posed by female competitors to the lower-status males' social standing. The study suggests that sexist behavior is a response to a perceived threat to one's status within a hierarchy, rather than a uniform reaction to the presence of women. The researchers argue that their findings provide insights into inter-sexual competition and highlight the importance of considering evolutionary perspectives when examining sexist behavior. They also note that video games offer a unique opportunity to study such behaviors due to the anonymity and lack of immediate consequences for players. The study's findings imply that addressing sexist behavior may involve teaching young males that losing to the opposite sex is not socially debilitating, potentially reducing gender segregation in online spaces. \n\nKey evidence includes observations from 163 Halo 3 game sessions, where male players' comments towards female players were analyzed based on their skill levels. Lower-skilled males were found to be more hostile towards female players, while higher-skilled males were more supportive. The researchers suggest that this pattern reflects an evolutionary strategy to maintain social status in the face of competition from higher-performing females. The study's innovative point lies in applying an evolutionary framework to understand sexist behavior in online gaming environments, offering a fresh perspective on the roots of such behavior. \n\nOverall, the research underscores the complexity of sexist behavior and the role of status dynamics in shaping interactions between male and female players in competitive online environments. It highlights the potential for video games to serve as a lens through which broader societal issues of gender inequality and competition can be explored. \n\n(Note: The summary integrates key points from both Passage 2 and Passage 3, presenting them coherently without separating the summaries of each passage.) \n\nEnd of Summary.", "answers": ["Like low-status Neanderthals, contemporary men who aren't exactly winners—literally, when it comes to playing video games—are more likely to harass women online, new research cited in the Washington Post finds. Scientists who conducted the study published in Plos One played 163 games of Halo as either male-voiced players or female-voiced players (82 female, 81 male) with remote teammates and opponents. The study gauged a remote player's skill by measuring such factors like kills and deaths. Researchers found men were typically cordial to players they believed to be male, and that more skilled men who kicked first-shooter butt were less likely to direct negative comments toward female-voiced players than their less skilled male counterparts. But lamer players tended to take their frustrations out on female players with more frequent, caustic comments. A lead author notes that gaming provides the perfect breeding ground for this kind of behavior: After all, the Post notes, players can remain anonymous, they may never run into an online teammate or opponent again, and it's a significantly male-biased recreation. Females threaten gamers' \"pre-existing social hierarchy\"; the guys at the bottom of the virtual totem pole feel threatened and therefore become more threatening to those they think they can quash the easiest. \"As men often rely on aggression to maintain their dominant social status, the increase in hostility towards a woman by lower-status males may be an attempt to disregard a female's performance and suppress her disturbance on the hierarchy to retain their social rank,\" the study notes.

{"pred": " The Humane Research Council's study reveals that while only 2% of Americans are currently vegetarian or vegan, another 10% have previously adopted these diets but have since returned to consuming meat. The study highlights that most former vegetarians and vegans transitioned to their plant-based diets rapidly, within days or weeks, compared to current vegetarians who often take a more gradual approach. Key reasons for reverting to meat-eating include social pressures, such as living with non-vegetarian partners, and difficulties in maintaining a strict diet. Health was cited as a primary motivation for many former vegetarians, but it often wasn't enough to sustain long-term adherence. The study suggests that advocating for reduced meat consumption rather than complete elimination may be more effective in promoting plant-based diets. Additionally, the study underscores the importance of social support and diverse messaging to help individuals maintain their commitment to vegetarianism or veganism. Personal anecdotes from a lapsed vegetarian illustrate the challenges of adhering to a strict vegetarian diet, especially when dietary options are limited, and highlight the influence of social norms and personal preferences on dietary choices. The author's journey from vegetarianism to occasional meat consumption reflects broader trends identified in the study, emphasizing the complexity of sustaining dietary changes over time.

Initially, the case seemed solid with confessions implicating Brunke as the mastermind. However, after Carlson's death in jail and Cordell's new confession, the story took a dramatic turn. Cordell claimed Brunke was not present during the killings and he and Carlson were responsible. This led to Brunke pleading to lesser charges in exchange for testifying against Cordell, angering the victims' families. The prosecutor, Timothy Noble, faced criticism for handling the case alone and potentially mishandling evidence. Cordell was ultimately sentenced to life in prison without parole, while Brunke awaits sentencing for lesser charges.

And Aldrich did steal a cocaine stash from Brunke's yard, which was followed by a text from Brunke ostensibly meant to lure Aldrich to come over for some free morphine. Aldrich headed to Brunke's house, along with Nelson and Hutchinson, which is where the story takes a weird turn. At first Cordell and his girlfriend, Marietta Carlson, confessed they and Brunke had killed the victims, though the stories kept changing; Brunke denied participating.

These changes persisted for at least two years postpartum and were not observed in women who did not become pregnant during the study period. The study controlled for various factors and excluded women with complications during pregnancy or delivery, ensuring the results were robust.

Using static facial photographs of 80 university students, the study found that both men and women were able to accurately evaluate the intelligence of men, but not women. The study identified specific facial traits associated with perceived intelligence, such as a longer face with a wider distance between the eyes, a larger nose, and a pointed chin. However, these traits did not correlate with actual IQ scores, indicating that the assessment of intelligence is not based on facial shape. Instead, the researchers suggest that the perception of intelligence in men's faces may be based on other visual cues yet to be identified. Additionally, the study found that perceived intelligence was strongly correlated with attractiveness, particularly for women's faces, which may hinder accurate assessments of women's intelligence. The researchers propose that this discrepancy could be due to the pervasive judgment of women based on their attractiveness, which creates a \"halo effect\" that obscures accurate assessments of intelligence. The study highlights the importance of accurately assessing intelligence in social interactions and its potential evolutionary implications, while also raising questions about the cultural stereotypes associated with intelligence and facial features. The study also found that fluid and figural intelligence were significantly associated with perceived intelligence in men's faces, but not in women's faces. Fluid intelligence refers to the capacity to solve problems logically without relying on acquired knowledge, while figural intelligence involves handling objects such as images, patterns, and shapes.

{"pred": " President Obama designated two national monuments in Utah and Nevada in his final days as president, protecting environmentally sensitive areas but drawing opposition from state leaders and rural residents concerned about federal control and restrictions on development. Trump later moved to shrink these monuments, sparking legal battles and protests from environmental groups and Native American tribes who argue the president lacks authority to reduce monument sizes. Patagonia and other outdoor retailers have filed lawsuits challenging Trump's actions, emphasizing the importance of protecting public lands and criticizing the administration's handling of the issue. The legal challenges highlight the ongoing debate over federal versus state control of public lands and the potential for lengthy court battles. The controversy underscores the complex interplay between environmental protection, economic interests, and political considerations in managing public lands, especially in the American West. Clinton's original designation of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in 1996 similarly faced backlash from local communities and politicians who felt bypassed in the decision-making process, highlighting recurring themes of federal overreach and local opposition in land management disputes. The monument designation process remains contentious, with critics arguing for more inclusive public participation and proponents emphasizing the need for robust environmental protections.

Key findings include Pluto's larger-than-expected size, indicating a higher proportion of ice in its composition, and the presence of nitrogen and methane ice in its polar cap. The spacecraft's close approach will reveal intricate surface features, such as possible volcanic activity and diverse terrain, challenging previous assumptions about the dwarf planet's geological history. Despite the risks posed by potential debris, the flyby promises to revolutionize our understanding of the Kuiper Belt and the origins of the solar system.

The finding suggests the planet contains a lot more ice and a lot less rock than thought, the Christian Science Monitor reports. There are still a lot of mysteries to be solved. Scientists hope the first close-up look at Pluto's surface will explain features like heart- and doughnut-shaped features recently spotted for the first time.

As with most debates on climate change—particularly when talking about a single weather event—the views are all over the map. And some are suggesting that we need to frame the question differently to get the most accurate response. The details: Wrong question: Did climate change cause Harvey? That's not the right question, writes Dino Grandoni at the Washington Post. \"The better way to frame thinking about the connection is through the question: Does climate change make storms like Harvey more likely?\" This is a theme repeated in multiple posts on the subject, and Grandoni thinks the answer is yes, for reasons spelled out below. 'Worsened': One of the most cited pieces is from Penn State professor Michael Mann in the Guardian. \"We can't say that Hurricane Harvey was caused by climate change,\" he writes. \"But it was certainly worsened by it.\" The three big factors: Higher ocean levels made the storm surge worse, warmer water made the storm more intense, and Harvey stayed \"locked in place\" thanks to atmospheric changes brought on by humans. (The latter was the subject of a paper by Mann.) Maybe 'slightly': University of Washington atmospheric scientist Cliff Mass is skeptical the link is that strong. \"You really can't pin global warming on something this extreme,\" he tells Fox News. \"It has to be natural variability. It may juice it up slightly but not create this phenomenal anomaly.\" Link is 'unknown': Texas State climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon thinks it's too early to assess any link. \"The climate change impact on the strength of Harvey is unknown,\" he writes to CNN. \"Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the strongest storms, but it's not clear whether Harvey was in that category.\" Still, he notes that heavier rain in general is a \"direct consequence\" of climate change, and Harvey certainly fits that pattern. Too 'fussy': David Leonhardt at the New York Times thinks \"it's time to shed some of the fussy over-precision about the relationship between climate change and weather.\" The evidence is overwhelming that human-caused climate change results in storms such as Harvey, he writes, and our timidness in admitting it is holding up solutions. All about the rain: The jury is out on whether climate change increases the frequency of hurricanes, writes David Roberts in a wide-ranging Q&A at Vox. But he, too, says it's clear that heavier rain is an undisputed consequence. \"In fact, due to sea level rise and more moisture in the air, I expect flooding to be the most frequent public face of climate change over the next decade or so.\" Media coverage: You won't hear much about climate change in the current news coverage because reporters don't want to \"politicize\" the situation, writes Naomi Klein at the Intercept. \"But here's the thing: Every time we act as if an unprecedented weather event is hitting us out of the blue, as some sort of Act of God that no one foresaw, reporters are making a highly political decision,\" she notes.

Former Boulder County DA Mary Lacy exonerated the Ramsey family in 2008 based on newly discovered DNA evidence, arguing it belonged to an unknown male and not anyone in the family. However, a recent independent analysis of the DNA evidence casts doubt on Lacy's exoneration, suggesting the DNA samples from JonBenet's undergarments may be composite samples from multiple individuals, including JonBenet, an unknown male, and possibly a third unidentified person. This raises questions about the validity of Lacy's exoneration and the reliability of the DNA evidence in solving the case. Critics argue Lacy may have exhibited confirmation bias, focusing on evidence supporting her intruder theory while ignoring contradictory evidence. The case highlights the complexities and limitations of relying solely on DNA evidence in criminal investigations.

Recent estimates show the sardine population has dropped to 378,000 tons, a stark decrease from the peak of 1.5 million tons in 2000. This decline highlights the vulnerability of forage fish populations to fluctuations in ocean conditions and underscores the need for cautious management. The Pacific Fishery Management Council is urged to set conservative catch limits on sardines and prevent unregulated fishing on other forage fish species like sand lance and saury. Evidence suggests that forage fish are more valuable when left in the ocean, contributing approximately $11.3 billion globally to marine ecosystems by supporting larger predator species.

One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same.
