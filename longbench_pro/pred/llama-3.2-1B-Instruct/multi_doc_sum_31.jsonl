For the record, they calculate the rate to be 45.5 miles per second per megaparsec, the latter being the equivalent of 3.26 million light-years.

And that's got scientists worried, especially with the prevalence of e-cigarettes that come in kid-friendly flavors such as cotton candy. \"E-cigarettes may be safer than regular cigarettes for adults who are transitioning from smoking to vaping, but for youth who have never used any other tobacco products, nicotine experimentation could become nicotine addiction,\" Barrington-Trimis says."], "length": 24917}

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regulates PMA rates to ensure that they are set high enough to repay the U.S. Treasury on schedule for the portion of federal facility costs that have been allocated to hydropower beneficiaries. Since FY2011, power revenues associated with the PMAs have been classified as discretionary offsetting receipts (i.e., receipts that are available for spending by the PMAs), thus the agencies are sometimes noted as having a \"net-zero\" spending authority. Only the capital expenses of WAPA and SWPA require appropriations from Congress. Each PMA also has unique elements and regional issues that affect its business. They are discussed in alphabetical order. Created by the Bonneville Project Act of 1937 (16 U.S.C. §832) just before the completion of two large dams in the Pacific Northwest—Bonneville Dam in 1938 and Grand Coulee Dam in 1941—BPA was the first PMA. Though it serves a smaller geographical area, BPA is on par with WAPA (which serves the largest area) in the size of its transmission system. The agency operates and maintains about 75% of the high voltage transmission lines in its service territory, which includes Idaho, Oregon, Washington, western Montana and small parts of eastern Montana, California, Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming. BPA also markets wholesale electricity from 31 federally owned hydropower facilities in the Northwest. These generation facilities are owned both by the Corps and BOR. BPA differs from the other three PMAs in that it is self-financed: it receives no federal appropriations. Since passage of the Federal Columbia River Transmission System Act of 1974 (16 U.S.C. §838), BPA has covered its operating costs through power rates set to ensure repayment to the Treasury of capital and interest on funds used to construct the Columbia River power system. BPA also has permanent Treasury borrowing authority, which it may use for capital on large projects. This money is repaid with interest, through power sales. As of 2018, BPA had $5.53 billion of bonds outstanding to the U.S. Treasury, with BPA's current borrowing authority capped by Congress at $7.70 billion.", "answers": ["Will Ferrell's latest comedy about a wealthy white guy who enlists a law-abiding black man to help him prepare for life in prison is proving more controversial than his usual work. With accusations that Get Hard is homophobic and racist, Ferrell defends the flick to the AP, noting he and costar Kevin Hart \"show a mirror to what's already existing out there.\" Do critics agree? \"Perhaps there's an edgy dark comedy to be made about race, class, and the prospect of facing prison, but Get Hard is not it,\" Claudia Puig writes at USA Today.

The essay explains that Smith was ordered to take multiple wives by an angel who visited him three times between 1834 and 1842; in the last instance, the angel was armed with a sword and threatened a reluctant Smith. The leader, then married to first wife Emma, took his first plural wife, Fanny Alger, in Kirtland, Ohio. Smith and Alger ultimately separated, and the church relocated to Nauvoo, Ill., where he married many more women.

The agency carries out its responsibilities in three main program areas: (1) managing public lands, known collectively as the National Forest System, through nine regional offices, 154 national forests, 20 national grasslands, and over 600 ranger districts; (2) conducting research through its network of seven research stations, multiple associated research laboratories, and 81 experimental forests and ranges; and (3) working with state and local governments, forest industries, and private landowners and forest users in the management, protection, and development of forest land in nonfederal ownership, largely through its nine regional offices. According to the Forest Service, it employs a workforce of over 30,000 employees across the country. However, this number grows by thousands in the summer months, when the agency hires seasonal employees to conduct fieldwork, respond to wildland fires, and meet the visiting public’s needs. The Office of the Chief of the Forest Service is located in Washington, D.C., with 27 offices reporting directly to the Office of the Chief, as illustrated in figure 1. The nine national forest regions, each led by a regional forester, oversee the national forests and grasslands located in their respective regions. Each national forest or grassland is headed by a supervisor, the seven research stations are each led by a station director, and a state and private forestry area is headed by an area director. The Forest Service collectively refers to its forest regions, research stations, and area as RSAs.

Specifically, of the 148 providers, the VA medical centers did not initiate reviews of 16 providers for 3 months, and in some cases, for multiple years, after concerns had been raised about the providers’ care. In a few of these cases, additional concerns about the providers’ clinical care were raised before the reviews began. We found that two factors were largely responsible for the inadequate documentation and untimely reviews of providers’ clinical care we identified at the selected VA medical centers. First, VHA policy does not require VA medical centers to document all types of reviews of providers’ clinical care, including retrospective reviews, and VHA has not established a timeliness requirement for initiating reviews of providers’ clinical care. Second, VHA’s oversight of the reviews of providers’ clinical care is inadequate. Under VHA policy, networks are responsible for overseeing the credentialing and privileging processes at their respective VA medical centers. While reviews of providers’ clinical care after concerns are raised are a component of credentialing and privileging, we found that none of the network officials we spoke with described any routine oversight of such reviews.

The president of the Charleston NAACP tells the Post and Courier that a survivor says the gunman briefly sat down in the Emanuel AME Church before opening fire on a prayer meeting, but at a news conference this morning, Mullen said the shooter stuck around for almost an hour before the shooting began, the AP reports. Mullen also distributed a surveillance video of a possible suspect and vehicle, and added that the victims were six females and three males. The NAACP chief says the gunman told one woman he was letting her live so she could tell others what happened. \"It is unfathomable that somebody in today's society would walk into a church when people are having a prayer meeting and take their lives,\" Mullen told reporters. \"I can assure you that we're going to do everything in our power to find this individual, to lock him up and to make sure he doesn't hurt anyone else.\" Mayor Joe Riley called the suspect \"one hateful person,\" describing the shooting as \"the most dastardly act that one could possibly imagine.\" In other developments: Helicopters are circling Charleston in the search for the suspect, who's described as a white male, around 21 years old, slender, clean-shaven, and wearing a gray sweatshirt, blue jeans, and Timberland boots, the Guardian reports. Police say he is \"obviously extremely dangerous.\" State Sen. Clementa Pinckney, the church's pastor, was in the church at the time of the attack, and State House Minority leader Todd Rutherford tells the AP that the lawmaker was among those killed.

In other words, they had \"locked-in syndrome,\" meaning total motor paralysis in spite of normal cognitive and emotional processing. Researchers at the University of Tübingen in Germany fitted the patients with caps through which they could observe changes in blood flow in different parts of the brain, they explain in the journal PLOS Biology. They first asked the patients to think yes or no in response to simple statements such as their spouse's name, and moved on to more personal questions when that was mastered. “It’s the first sign that completely locked-in syndrome may be abolished forever, because with all of these patients, we can now ask them the most critical questions in life,” says researcher Niels Birbaumer. The patients, all of whom are on ventilators and being cared for at home, range in age from 24 to 76. The team did stumble on a couple surprises. For instance, all four patients suggested they were \"happy\" with their lives in spite of being locked-in. (Birmbaumer suggests this might be because of something akin to meditation.)

A pair of arms extend along the other two opposed sides of the body and are integrally attached together by a handle portion fixedly secured to remote ends of the arms. The arms are of a multi-link construction and are pivotable about the body member along the sides thereof. Additionally, a roller is fixedly secured between the pair of arms at a position remote from and in substantial parallel alignment with the handle portion. In this respect, the roller lies between the body member and the canvas and is rotatable relative thereto in response to a pivotable movement of the arms along the sides of the body member. The multi-link construction of the arms permits an effective variation in their respective lengths, so as to facilitate movement of the roller along the body member at variable distances about the pivot points of the arms to the body. As can be further ascertained with reference to FIGS. 1 and 2, a pivotal movement of the arms along the sides of the body member results in the roller tending to pull the canvas away from the body member. However, due to the attachment of the canvas to respective ends of the body member, the canvas can only roll along across itself in a manner which results in the sheets of flammable material, along with the other flammable materials positioned thereon, being rolled into a log shape suitable for burning in a fireplace or the like.

{"pred": " Passage 4\nThe federal government receives funds from various sources, including user fees, fines, and penalties. According to the Budget of the U.S. Government, in fiscal year 2017, the U.S. government’s total receipts were $3.3 trillion and collections of fees, fines, and penalties were more than $350 billion. User fees are charges assessed to users for goods or services provided by the federal government, such as fees to enter a national park, and charges assessed for regulatory services, such as fees charged by the Food and Drug Administration for prescription drug applications. Fees are an approach to financing federal programs or activities that are related to some voluntary transaction or request for government services above and beyond what is normally available to the public. By requiring identifiable beneficiaries to pay all or part of the cost of a good or service, fees can promote both equity and economic efficiency. Regularly reviewing fees help ensure that agencies, Congress, and stakeholders have complete information. Fines and penalties are imposed by courts as punishment for criminal violations. Civil monetary penalties are not a result of criminal proceedings but are employed by courts and federal agencies to enforce federal laws and regulations. For example, civil monetary penalties are collected from financial institutions by certain financial regulators, such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, from enforcement actions assessed against financial institutions for violations related to anti-money laundering requirements. Reviews and, as needed, adjustments to fines and penalties could help ensure they provide a meaningful incentive for compliance. The design and structure of statutory authorities for fees, fines, and penalties can vary widely. In prior work, we have identified key design decisions related to how fee, fine, and penalty collections are used that help Congress balance agency flexibility with congressional control and oversight. Congress determines the availability of collections by defining the extent to which an agency may obligate and expend them, including the availability of the funds, the period of time the collections are available for obligation, the purposes for which they may be obligated, and the amount of the collections that are available to the agency. Fees, fines, and penalties may be categorized as one of three types of collections based on the structure of their statutory authority: offsetting collections, offsetting receipts, or governmental receipts (see figure 1). Offsetting collections can provide agencies with more flexibility because they are generally available for agency obligation without an additional annual appropriation. In contrast, offsetting receipts and governmental receipts involve greater congressional opportunities for control and oversight because, generally, additional congressional action is needed before the collections are available for agency obligation.

Many of the products the federal government buys—including aircraft engines and medical supplies—are end products that may be subject to the requirements of the Buy American Act. Further, the Buy American Act does not apply to products that are purchased for use outside the United States or obtained through contracts under the micro-purchase threshold, which was generally $3,500 in fiscal year 2017. end products manufactured in the United States provided that (a) the product is a commercially available off-the-shelf item; or (b) the cost of the components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States exceeds 50 percent of the total cost of all components. end products that are not considered domestic under the Buy American Act are treated as foreign. This characterization is based on the origin of the end product—that is, where the product is manufactured or produced—and not the vendor’s location. For example, a vendor located in Finland may supply end products manufactured in the United States, in which case these products would be treated as domestic products. Conversely, a vendor located in the United States may supply end products manufactured in Finland. In this case, the end products would be considered foreign. Although the Buy American Act establishes a preference for domestic end products, there are situations in which agencies can procure foreign end products through established exceptions to the Buy American requirements. In addition, under the Trade Agreements Act of 1979, the United States has waived domestic purchasing requirements—including the Buy American Act—for certain acquisitions of foreign end products from countries that are party to international trade agreements or are considered designated countries by the U.S. Trade Representative. In implementing the Buy American Act, the FAR sets forth several exceptions that permit federal agencies to buy foreign end products. These include situations when a domestic end product is not produced in sufficient quantities or cases where the cost would be unreasonable to buy a domestic end product. The steps that contracting officers must take to determine or document an exception will vary depending on the circumstances of the acquisition. For example, a written determination from the Head of Contracting Activity (HCA) or a delegate may be necessary to determine non-availability in some cases.

The investigation also found that the Patriots' footballs were wet from being used in the rain for an extended period during the first half, and that the league did not take any precautionary steps in advance of the game to prevent this.

{"pred": " Passage 3\nThe federal government, through the Department of Energy, operates four regional power marketing administrations (PMAs), created by statute: the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), the Southeastern Power Administration (SEPA), the Southwestern Power Administration (SWPA), and the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA). Each PMA operates in a distinct geographic area of the coterminous United States (see Figure 1). Congressional interest in the PMAs has included diverse issues such as rate setting, cost and compliance associated with the Endangered Species Act (ESA; P.L. 93-205 ; 16 U.S.C. §§1531 et seq.), and questions of privatization of these federal agencies. In general, the PMAs came into being because of the government's need to dispose of electric power produced by federal dams constructed largely for irrigation, flood control, or other purposes, and to achieve small community and farm electrification—that is, providing service to customers whom it would not have been profitable for a private utility to serve. With minor exceptions, these agencies market the electric power produced by federal dams constructed, owned, and operated by the Corps of Engineers (Corps) and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (BOR). PMAs must give preference to public utility districts and cooperatives (e.g., \"preference customers\"), selling their power at cost-based rates set at the lowest possible rate consistent with sound business principles. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regulates PMA rates to ensure that they are set high enough to repay the U.S. Treasury on schedule for the portion of federal facility costs that have been allocated to hydropower beneficiaries. Since FY2011, power revenues associated with the PMAs have been classified as discretionary offsetting receipts (i.e., receipts that are available for spending by the PMAs), thus the agencies are sometimes noted as having a \"net-zero\" spending authority. Only the capital expenses of WAPA and SWPA require appropriations from Congress. Each PMA also has unique elements and regional issues that affect its business. They are discussed in alphabetical order. Created by the Bonneville Project Act of 1937 (16 U.S.C. §832) just before the completion of two large dams in the Pacific Northwest—Bonneville Dam in 1938 and Grand Coulee Dam in 1941—BPA was the first PMA.

The essay explains that Smith was ordered to take multiple wives by an angel who visited him three times between 1834 and 1842; in the last instance, the angel was armed with a sword and threatened a reluctant Smith. The leader, then married to first wife Emma, took his first plural wife, Fanny Alger, in Kirtland, Ohio.

The coup attempt was carried out by elements of the Turkish military, who were backed by the Gülen Movement, a moderate Sunni cleric whose movement claims millions of followers in Turkey and around the world. The coup attempt was thwarted by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who accused the coup plotters of trying to kill him. The government declared the situation under control, and 2,839 people were rounded up, from foot soldiers to senior officers, including those who formed “the backbone” of the rebellion. The coup attempt was seen as a failure by Erdogan, who has long accused Gülen of trying to overthrow the government. The failed coup attempt has had significant implications for Turkey, including the consolidation of power behind Erdogan and the targeting of the Gülen Movement. The coup attempt has also had significant implications for the Middle East, including the destabilization of the region and the rise of extremist groups. The Turkish government has vowed to crack down on the Gülen Movement, and Erdogan has accused the movement of being a terrorist organization.

The town is home to Fethullah Gulen, an influential cleric who leads a popular movement called Hizmet, and President Recep Tayyib Erdogan blames his followers for the coup attempt that left at least 161 dead in overnight clashes, the New York Times reports. \"I have a message for Pennsylvania: You have engaged in enough treason against this nation,\" Erdogan said early Saturday. \"If you dare, come back to your country.\" Gulen, a moderate Muslim cleric who has lived in the US since 1999, was Erdogan's ally until 2013, when the leader blamed him for corruption allegations. In other coverage: Vox has more on the Gulenist movement, which runs a large network of schools and supports interfaith dialogue, secular democracy, science, and a progressive stance on social issues. Gulen says he condemns the coup attempt \"in the strongest terms.\" The AP reports that John Kerry says the US would consider an extradition request for Gulen, though nothing has been received yet and firm evidence would be required. \"We fully anticipate that there will be questions raised about Mr. Gulen,\" Kerry told reporters. \"And obviously we would invite the government of Turkey, as we always do, to present us with any legitimate evidence that withstands scrutiny.\" The New York Times looks at how the fallout from the coup will make the region's politics even more complicated for the US and Europe, which saw Erdogan's government as a stable and reliable ally. \"The danger here is this could spiral out of control and turn into a full-blown civil war,\" says former US Ambassador to Turkey Eric S. Edelman. CNN reports on how many civilian supporters of Erdogan stood up to the coup attempt, in some cases blocking military vehicles with their cars and even lying down in front of tanks. Almost 3,000 military service members have been arrested and almost the same number of judges have been removed from their duties in what appears to be a nationwide purge of Gulen supporters, the Guardian reports. Reuters reports that Erdogan, who had been vacationing on the country's southeast coast, addressed thousands of supporters after flying into Ankara's airport early Saturday. \" This uprising is a gift from God to us because this will be a reason to cleanse our army,\" he said. Turkey's Prime Minister Binali Yildirim says 161 people were killed and 1,440 were injured in the coup attempt, but a government source tells the AP that the figures exclude coup plotters, meaning the true toll could be much higher.

Reclamation's management of the basin is guided by the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Forum, which aims to conserve water and protect endangered species. The forum has established water quality standards and implemented measures to reduce salinity and improve water quality. However, the forum's effectiveness has been questioned, and some have argued that the forum's focus on salinity control has led to the neglect of other important issues, such as water conservation and habitat protection. The Colorado River Compact of 1922, negotiated by the seven basin states and the federal government, established a framework for apportioning water supplies between the Upper and Lower Basins. The compact has undergone several revisions, including the 2007 Interim Guidelines for Lower Basin Shortages and the Coordinated Operations for Lake Powell and Lake Mead. The guidelines have been criticized for their complexity and lack of clarity, and some have argued that they have led to water shortages and conflicts between states. The 2007 Interim Guidelines also established the Binational Water Scarcity Contingency Plan, which provides for the payment of water rights to states in the event of drought.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulates PMA rates to ensure that they are set high enough to repay the U.S. Treasury on schedule for the portion of federal facility costs that have been allocated to hydropower beneficiaries. The PMAs are unique among the four PMAs in two ways. It is the smallest PMA, with just over 40 employees, and, unlike the other three agencies, SEPA does not operate or maintain any transmission facilities, and thus contracts with other utilities for transmitting the federal power it markets to more than 12 million consumers. SEPA's facilities are aging; for instance, in 2018 it reported that its Cumberland System customers have agreed to fund $1.2 billion of planned rehabilitations of the nine hydroelectric facilities in the Corps. According to SEPA, it has an overcapacity issue. Projections for electricity load growth (in consultation with its preference customers) made before the 2008 economic downturn reportedly led to SEPA acquiring additional capacity it currently does not use. As a result, municipalities and electric cooperatives in SEPA's service area will have to make economic decisions regarding how to handle this excess capacity. As of 2018, at least one preference customer has terminated its contract with SEPA due to this issue.

The researchers say the rate of ice loss has tripled over the last decade and the melting ice sheets are now pushing up sea levels around the world by around a half-millimeter every year, reports the BBC. Antarctica was losing around 49 billion tons of ice a year in the mid-1990s, which went up to an average 219 billion tons a year between 2012 and 2017, the study found. The researchers, who used satellite data going back more than 25 years, say most of the melting ice comes from the West Antarctic sheet, parts of which are in a \"state of collapse\"—and modest ice growth in the East Antarctic is nowhere near enough to offset it. \"The increasing mass loss that they’re finding is really worrying, particularly looking at the West Antarctic, the area that’s changing most rapidly,\" University of Waterloo glaciologist Christine Dow tells the Washington Post. \"And it’s the area that we’re most worried about, because it’s below sea level.\" Antarctica has lost a total of around 3 trillion tons of ice since 1992 and will be contributing more and more to sea level rise if the current trend continues, warn researchers, who say climate change is the only plausible explanation for the ice loss. \"I think we should be worried.

The study found that East Antarctica is losing relatively little ice a year — about 31 tons — since 2012. The melting of Antarctica is pushing up global sea levels by 0.6mm annually, a three-fold increase since 2012. The study suggests that Antarctica is becoming a significant player in sea-level rise, with the continent contributing about half of the global sea-level rise.

The studies found that these decisions can result in certain groups of students being more harshly disciplined than others. The studies also found that the types of offenses that Black children were disciplined for were largely based on school officials' interpretations of behavior. For example, one study found that Black girls were disproportionately disciplined for subjective interpretations of behaviors, such as disobedience and disruptive behavior. A separate study used eye-tracking technology to show that teachers gazed longer at Black boys than other children when asked to look for challenging behavior based on video clips.

The court also found that the law's \"show me your papers\" provision, which requires police officers to determine the immigration status of individuals they arrest or stop for questioning, was unconstitutional.

After his suicide, Stacy started researching gambling addiction (she hadn't even known about her husband's problem) and filed suit against the West Virginia casino where he was a regular, as well as the maker of the slot machines there. Experts relay how casinos track and target addicted gamblers, supply ready flows of cash via on-site ATMs, and offer plenty of perks to keep them coming back. But it's the modern-day slot machines themselves, with deceptive technology called virtual reel mapping, that seem to be designed to lull gamblers into a trance—or what the industry refers to as \"continuous gaming productivity\"—so they don't stop playing. While the casinos and machine manufacturers place the blame for gambling addictions on individuals, Terry Noffsinger, the lead attorney for the Stevens suit, says these addictive machines are not due to \"negligence. It's intentional.\" Stacy Stevens lost her case in West Virginia, but Noffsinger believes the movement to hold casinos accountable for addicts will gain momentum, much like how the tobacco industry eventually paid for sickening its own customers. \"The public is learning more about it,\" he says.

{"pred": " \n\nPassage 1:\nThe Fort Lee lane closure scandal, also known as the George Washington Bridge lane closure scandal or Bridgegate, is a U.S. political scandal in which a staff member and political appointees of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie colluded to create traffic jams in Fort Lee, New Jersey, by closing lanes at the main toll plaza for the upper level of the George Washington Bridge. The scandal began on September 9, 2013, when two of three toll lanes for a local street entrance were closed during morning rush hour. Local officials, emergency services, and the public were not notified of the lane closures, which caused significant traffic congestion and delays. The resulting back-ups and gridlock on local streets ended only when the two lanes were reopened on Friday, September 13, 2013, by an order from Port Authority Executive Director Patrick Foye. The scandal was initially met with skepticism by some, but it gained widespread attention and scrutiny after the release of a series of e-mails and text messages between Christie's staff and Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich. The scandal led to a federal investigation, which resulted in the indictment of Bridget Anne Kelly, the deputy chief of staff, and Bill Baroni, the deputy executive director of the Port Authority. The investigation also revealed that David Wildstein, a staff member, had ordered the lane closures, and that the closures were intended to punish Sokolich for not endorsing Christie in the 2013 New Jersey gubernatorial election. The scandal has had significant consequences for Christie's political career, including his decision to drop out of the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.\n\nPassage 3:\nAn ex-Teaneck firefighter with a law degree decided to take matters into his own hands and file a complaint against Governor Chris Christie in Fort Lee Municipal Court. The complaint alleged that Christie knew about the politically-vindictive lane closures and did nothing to stop them. The complaint was filed by William Brennan, a retired Teaneck firefighter and citizen activist. Brennan alleges that Christie's failure to end the closures constitutes second-degree official misconduct, a charge punishable by five to 10 years in prison. The complaint was approved by Judge Roy McGeady, who ruled that there is probable cause to believe that Christie was involved in the lane closures. The case now forwards Brennan's summons to Bergen County Prosecutor Gurbir S. Grewal, who will decide whether to charge the governor. The case has sparked controversy and criticism from Christie's supporters, who claim that the complaint is \"int", "answers": ["A citizen's official misconduct complaint against New Jersey Gov.

Per Brennan's complaint, Christie knew lane closures were happening and could have put a stop to the whole thing. The complaint is based on testimony from the trial against former Christie aide Bridget Anne Kelly and former Port Authority executive Bill Baroni. During the trial, a man Christie appointed to Port Authority testified that both he and Baroni told Christie about the lane closures during a 9/11 ceremony (the lanes were closed from Sept. 9 to Sept. 13, 2013). Now that the judge has ruled the complaint can move forward, it will go to the Bergen County Prosecutor's Office so a decision can be made as to whether Christie should be indicted. Christie's office, which insists the governor had no knowledge of the lane closures while they were ongoing, said it would appeal the judge's ruling.

In other words, they had \"locked-in syndrome,\" meaning total motor paralysis in spite of normal cognitive and emotional processing. Researchers at the University of Tübingen in Germany fitted the patients with caps through which they could observe changes in blood flow in different parts of the brain, they explain in the journal PLOS Biology. They first asked the patients to think yes or no in response to simple statements such as their spouse's name, and moved on to more personal questions when that was mastered. “It’s the first sign that completely locked-in syndrome may be abolished forever, because with all of these patients, we can now ask them the most critical questions in life,” says researcher Niels Birbaumer. The patients, all of whom are on ventilators and being cared for at home, range in age from 24 to 76. The team did stumble on a couple surprises. For instance, all four patients suggested they were \"happy\" with their lives in spite of being locked-in. (Birmbaumer suggests this might be because of something akin to meditation.)

{"pred": " Passage 2\nThe House of Representatives has standing rules that govern how bills and resolutions are to be taken up and considered on the floor. However, to expedite legislation receiving floor action, the House may temporarily set aside these rules for measures that are not otherwise privileged for consideration. This can be done by agreeing to a special order of business resolution (special rule) or by adopting a motion to suspend the rules and pass the underlying measure. Most bills and resolutions that receive floor action in the House are called up and considered under suspension of the rules. The suspension procedure allows nonprivileged measures to be raised without a special rule, waives points of order, limits debate, and prohibits floor amendments. Motions to suspend the rules and pass the measure require a two-thirds vote, so the procedure is typically reserved for bills and resolutions that can meet a supermajority threshold. Decisions to schedule bills for consideration under suspension are generally based on how widely supported the measures are, how long Members wish to debate them, and whether they want to propose floor amendments. These decisions are not necessarily related to the subject matter of the measure. Accordingly, measures brought up under suspension cover a wide range of policy areas but most often address government operations, such as the designation of federal facilities. This report describes the suspension procedure, which is defined in clause 1 of House Rule XV, and provides an analysis of measures considered under suspension during the 114 th Congress (2015-2016). Figures 1-8 display statistical data, including the prevalence and form of suspension measures, sponsors of measures, committee consideration, length of floor debate, voting, and resolution of differences between the chambers.

Sanders calls it the Medicare for All Act of 2017, but you'll also hear phrases such as \"single payer\" and \"universal health care\" used to describe it. One key part missing: details on how to pay for it, though Sanders plans to release a separate paper on that, reports the Wall Street Journal. Coverage: The basics: Per CNN, everybody gets a \"Universal Medicare card,\" which would be used to cover all health bills, from surgeries to dental care to substance abuse treatment. Co-payments would go away, and people would pay premiums based on their incomes, reports the AP. Private insurers would still exist, but for things such as elective plastic surgery or, sometimes, to act as middlemen between the government and hospitals or doctors. A 'right': Sanders makes his case in an op-ed in the New York Times. \"Guaranteeing health care as a right is important to the American people not just from a moral and financial perspective; it also happens to be what the majority of the American people want.\" 'Single payer': David Leonhardt of the New York Times has a Q&A on the fundamentals, including the basic question of what the term \"single payer\" means. In short, it \"describes a system in which only one entity—the government—pays medical bills. If all Americans had Medicare rather than insurance through their jobs, it would be a single-payer system.\" Vox says Sanders' system is far more generous than single-payer plans in Canada and elsewhere. The cost: This could cost hundreds of billions of dollars more per year, per the Journal. Details are yet to come, but Sanders envisions a progressive tax increase, with the wealthy paying more income, capital gains, and estate taxes, reports Newsweek. The senator says higher taxes for families would be offset by the fact that they no longer have to buy insurance. Still, in regard to single-payer systems, \"no one—including Sanders—has truly reckoned with how to pay for whatever system they might support,\" writes Mike Allen at Axios. Litmus test? By all accounts, the chances of it passing a GOP-controlled Congress are precisely 0%. But it's turning into a political litmus test of sorts for Democrats, reports the Washington Post. Sanders has the support of 15 Democratic senators so far, including all of those seen as potential 2020 presidential candidates.

But Bacon lays out the political and policy reasons why Democrats might avoid \"becoming the party of single payer.\" Relishing the fight: Republicans see a chance to pounce. \"We welcome the Democrats' strategy of moving even further left,\" says Katie Martin, spokesperson for the Senate GOP's campaign organization, per the AP."], "length": 26165}

The study gauged a remote player's skill by measuring such factors like kills and deaths. Researchers found men were typically cordial to players they believed to be male, and that more skilled men who kicked first-shooter butt were less likely to direct negative comments toward female-voiced players than their less skilled male counterparts. But lamer players tended to take their frustrations out on female players with more frequent, caustic comments. A lead author notes that gaming provides the perfect breeding ground for this kind of behavior: After all, the Post notes, players can remain anonymous, they may never run into an online teammate or opponent again, and it's a significantly male-biased recreation. Females threaten gamers' \"pre-existing social hierarchy\"; the guys at the bottom of the virtual totem pole feel threatened and therefore become more threatening to those they think they can quash the easiest. \"As men often rely on aggression to maintain their dominant social status, the increase in hostility towards a woman by lower-status males may be an attempt to disregard a female's performance and suppress her disturbance on the hierarchy to retain their social rank,\" the study notes.

The brutal killings of Heather Aldrich, her sister Carrie Nelson, and Nelson's boyfriend Jody Hutchinson—all of whom were reportedly asphyxiated—and the discovery of their bodies in a burned-out SUV in the woods was linked back to Aldrich's relationship with Kenneth Brunke, who police and locals say was a gun-happy Manistique drug dealer, and his friend Garry Cordell, who tried to tell Brunke that Aldrich, the object of Brunke's affections, was using him for drugs. And Aldrich did steal a cocaine stash from Brunke's yard, which was followed by a text from Brunke ostensibly meant to lure Aldrich to come over for some free morphine. Aldrich headed to Brunke's house, along with Nelson and Hutchinson, which is where the story takes a weird turn. At first Cordell and his girlfriend, Marietta Carlson, confessed they and Brunke had killed the victims, though the stories kept changing; Brunke denied participating. But then, despite what looked to be certain convictions for all three, Carlson died while in custody, and Cordell suddenly dropped a bombshell: He and Carlson had committed all the murders themselves and Brunke hadn't been present (though he says Brunke did help set the car on fire with the victims' bodies in it). What some believe: Brunke may have paid off Cordell, an unemployed drifter, or promised to take care of Cordell's elderly mother if he took the blame. The cryptic statement Cordell offered in court when asked about a money exchange only fueled that suspicion: \"One man shall die so that the other may live.\" Cordell was sentenced to life in prison, per WLUC; Brunke will likely get five years or less for obstructing justice and lying to a cop when he's sentenced Jan. 21.

The scandal began on September 9, 2013, when two of three toll lanes for a local street entrance were closed during morning rush hour. Local officials, emergency services, and the public were not notified of the lane closures, which Fort Lee declared a threat to public safety.

The brain changes in the pregnancy group emerged from comparisons of those two groups. The results were consistent: A computer program could tell which women had gotten pregnant just by looking at results of the MRI scans. And the changes, first documented an average of 10 weeks after giving birth, were mostly still present two years after childbirth.

In 11 places in the brain, the MRI data indicate reductions in volume of the brain's gray matter, but it's not clear what that means. For example, it could reflect a pruning of the places where brain cells communicate, called synapses. Losing some synapses is not necessarily a bad thing.

The results showed that people can accurately evaluate the intelligence of men by viewing facial photographs, but not women. The study also found that the attractiveness of a person is not a reliable indicator of their intelligence, and that the perception of lower intelligence is associated with broader, more rounded faces with eyes closer to each other, a shorter nose, declining corners of the mouth, and a rounded and massive chin. The study concluded that the ability to accurately assess the intelligence of other persons is a complex trait that is influenced by a combination of facial features, and that it is not based on symmetry of the alignment of features.

The spacecraft will make its closest approach to Pluto at 31,000 mph, and the images it takes will provide the first close-up view of the dwarf planet and its five known moons. The spacecraft has been sent specifically to take pictures of Pluto, a part of the solar system that has been in deep freeze for billions of years. The data will be relayed back to the tracking station at Canberra's Deep Space Communication Complex (CDSCC). The New Horizons spacecraft is expected to become the first spacecraft to fly by Pluto, and its flyby will provide scientists with a wealth of new information about the dwarf planet and its moons. The spacecraft's journey to Pluto was a long and challenging one, taking 9.5 years to reach the dwarf planet. The spacecraft's instruments are designed to take detailed pictures of Pluto and its moons, and the data will be used to study the dwarf planet's geology, atmosphere, and potential habitability.

The confirmation will mark the completion of NASA's tour of the \"classical nine\" planets, reports the AP, which notes that Pluto was considered a full-fledged planet instead of a dwarf one when the probe began its journey in 2006. Some things to know about the historic flyby, which comes 50 years to the day after the first successful flyby of Mars: New Horizons will have to capture a vast amount of data in a short time. The probe will be pushed to its limits as it pivots to capture photos and information on Pluto and its moons Charon, Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra during the flyby. \"I can't wait to get into the data and really start making sense of it. Right now, we're just standing under the waterfall and enjoying it,\" principal New Horizons scientist Alan Stern tells the BBC. We don't know whether it was a success. The probe is far too busy to \"phone home,\" the AP notes, but it's expected to send a confirmation signal at around 9pm tonight. The eagerly awaited first photos from the flyby should be released tomorrow night, the Guardian reports, though it will take 16 months to send all the data from the flyby back to Earth. We've already learned a lot of new things about Pluto. \"The science we've already made is mouth-watering,\" says Stern. \"The Pluto system is enchanting in its strangeness and its alien beauty.\" Among NASA's findings in recent days: Pluto's North Pole has an icy cap and the planet's diameter is 1,597 miles across, not 1,471 miles as previously thought. The finding suggests the planet contains a lot more ice and a lot less rock than thought, the Christian Science Monitor reports. There are still a lot of mysteries to be solved. Scientists hope the first close-up look at Pluto's surface will explain features like heart- and doughnut-shaped features recently spotted for the first time. LiveScience notes that new information from Pluto could help explain how our own planet formed and how life began. \"There's a feeling among scientists that Pluto probably will tell us what the early solar system looked like and it's now locked in deep freeze and maybe it will tell us what we once were, a long time ago,\" the director of the Deep Space Communication Complex tells Reuters. The Australian facility will be first to receive new information from the spacecraft. New Horizons isn't done.

Scott Stevens, a 52-year-old man, was a former COO at Louis Berkman Investment and had a successful career. However, he became addicted to casino gambling and stole nearly $4 million from his company. Stevens had a wife, Stacy, and three daughters, but she had no idea about his addiction. He kept his addiction a secret and handled all the couple’s finances, using separate bank accounts and keeping his work address for his gambling correspondence. Stevens was a regular at the Mountaineer Casino in West Virginia and used the casino ATM to check his bank account. He spent four hours burning through $13,000 from the account, and then left the casino to write a letter to Stacy, informing her that he might be coming home without a job. Stevens also wrote a five-page letter to Stacy, detailing his financial situation and asking her to keep her credit intact. He was going to kill himself if she discovered his secret. Stevens was fired from his job after the firm discovered his embezzlement, and he was forced to leave the casino. He kept his addiction a secret and continued to gamble, eventually losing nearly $4.8 million in a single year. Stevens was a victim of a system carefully calibrated to prey on his weakness, one that robbed him of his money, his hope, and ultimately his life.\n\nSummary: Passage 5\nProblem gamblers, including Scott Stevens, are worth a lot of money to casinos. According to some research, 20 percent of regular gamblers are problem or pathological gamblers. Casinos know exactly who their biggest spenders are, primarily problem gamblers and outright addicts. They use loyalty cards, which allow them to track data on customers, to target their most reliable spenders. Casinos also employ hosts who befriend large spenders and use special offers to encourage them to stay longer or return soon. These hosts receive bonuses tied to the amount customers spend beyond their expected losses. The U.S. District Court for Nebraska agreed that Colombo had sufficiently proved its initial claim of unjust enrichment, which the casino would have to defend itself against.

For six years, his gambling habit spiraled out of control: He sneaked off to gamble when his wife thought he was working, embezzled nearly $4 million from his firm, and drained his family's savings—until the day in 2012 he decided to end his life. After his suicide, Stacy started researching gambling addiction (she hadn't even known about her husband's problem) and filed suit against the West Virginia casino where he was a regular, as well as the maker of the slot machines there. Experts relay how casinos track and target addicted gamblers, supply ready flows of cash via on-site ATMs, and offer plenty of perks to keep them coming back. But it's the modern-day slot machines themselves, with deceptive technology called virtual reel mapping, that seem to be designed to lull gamblers into a trance—or what the industry refers to as \"continuous gaming productivity\"—so they don't stop playing. While the casinos and machine manufacturers place the blame for gambling addictions on individuals, Terry Noffsinger, the lead attorney for the Stevens suit, says these addictive machines are not due to \"negligence.

As with most debates on climate change—particularly when talking about a single weather event—the views are all over the map. And some are suggesting that we need to frame the question differently to get the most accurate response. The details: Wrong question: Did climate change cause Harvey? That's not the right question, writes Dino Grandoni at the Washington Post. \"The better way to frame thinking about the connection is through the question: Does climate change make storms like Harvey more likely?\" This is a theme repeated in multiple posts on the subject, and Grandoni thinks the answer is yes, for reasons spelled out below. 'Worsened': One of the most cited pieces is from Penn State professor Michael Mann in the Guardian. \"We can't say that Hurricane Harvey was caused by climate change,\" he writes. \"But it was certainly worsened by it.\" The three big factors: Higher ocean levels made the storm surge worse, warmer water made the storm more intense, and Harvey stayed \"locked in place\" thanks to atmospheric changes brought on by humans. (The latter was the subject of a paper by Mann.) Maybe 'slightly': University of Washington atmospheric scientist Cliff Mass is skeptical the link is that strong. \"You really can't pin global warming on something this extreme,\" he tells Fox News. \"It has to be natural variability. It may juice it up slightly but not create this phenomenal anomaly.\" Link is 'unknown': Texas State climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon thinks it's too early to assess any link. \"The climate change impact on the strength of Harvey is unknown,\" he writes to CNN. \"Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the strongest storms, but it's not clear whether Harvey was in that category.\" Still, he notes that heavier rain in general is a \"direct consequence\" of climate change, and Harvey certainly fits that pattern. Too 'fussy': David Leonhardt at the New York Times thinks \"it's time to shed some of the fussy over-precision about the relationship between climate change and weather.\" The evidence is overwhelming that human-caused climate change results in storms such as Harvey, he writes, and our timidness in admitting it is holding up solutions. All about the rain: The jury is out on whether climate change increases the frequency of hurricanes, writes David Roberts in a wide-ranging Q&A at Vox. But he, too, says it's clear that heavier rain is an undisputed consequence. \"In fact, due to sea level rise and more moisture in the air, I expect flooding to be the most frequent public face of climate change over the next decade or so.\" Media coverage: You won't hear much about climate change in the current news coverage because reporters don't want to \"politicize\" the situation, writes Naomi Klein at the Intercept. \"But here's the thing: Every time we act as if an unprecedented weather event is hitting us out of the blue, as some sort of Act of God that no one foresaw, reporters are making a highly political decision,\" she notes.

Blocking or pulling back on regulations will be another priority of the Congress, per USA Today, with a bill expected that would give the GOP-controlled Congress approval power over any new federal regulations, as well as a \"Midnight Rules Act\" that would give Congress sway to nullify in bulk any rules passed during a president's final year in office.

Forensic experts who examined the results of DNA tests obtained exclusively by the two news organizations disputed former District Attorney Mary Lacy's conclusion that a DNA profile found in one place on JonBenet's underpants and two locations on her long johns was necessarily the killer's — which Lacy had asserted in clearing JonBenet's family of suspicion. The experts suggested that the DNA samples recovered from the long johns could have been degraded, and that variations in the way the original tests were done could account for the failure to find the same profile in the panties during the 2008 tests.

A joint investigation by the Boulder Daily Camera and 9News calls into question former District Attorney Mary Lacy's decision to exonerate the Ramsey family. At the time, Lacy concluded that DNA evidence found on JonBenet's underwear and long johns belonged to a male intruder who was not part of the Ramsey family. But now three forensic experts who examined the DNA test results and lab reports used by Lacy say they do not support her conclusion. For one thing, a sample on her underwear identified as coming from \"Unknown Male 1\" may in fact be a composite from multiple people and thus \"worthless as evidence,\" says the news report. Another revelation that further muddles the picture: DNA samples on her long johns appear to come from JonBenet and at least two other people, not one, a fact that has never been revealed before. What's more, the independent experts say all of the unknown DNA may be the result of \"inconsequential contact with other people,\" reports the Camera. With the exoneration, \"I was trying to prevent a horrible travesty of justice,\" Lacy tells ABC. (The interview was done before these latest revelations.) \"I was scared to death that despite the fact that there was no evidence, no psychopathy, and no motive, the case was a train going down the track and the Ramseys were tied to that track.\" Comparison to the DNA profile now in doubt was used to exonerate dozens of other potential suspects.

{"pred": " Pacific Fishery Management Council's efforts to protect the West Coast ecosystem are hindered by the decline of Pacific sardines, a crucial forage fish species. The decline is attributed to a combination of factors, including overfishing, climate change, and the collapse of the sardine fishery in the 1950s. The Pacific Fishery Management Council should take two key steps to address the decline: set conservative catch limits on sardines and fulfill its commitment to prohibit unregulated fishing on forage fish species. The decline of Pacific sardines has far-reaching consequences, including the decline of West Coast seabirds, whales, sharks, dolphins, and commercially important fish such as salmon and tuna. The decline also raises the potential for fishing pressure to shift to similar, but more abundant, schooling species of forage fish. The Pacific Fishery Management Council should take immediate action to address the decline of Pacific sardines and protect the West Coast ecosystem.\n\nPassage 3:\nThe Pacific Fishery Management Council, which manages fishing in federal waters off California, Oregon, and Washington, should do two things to help maintain a healthy Pacific Ocean: set conservative catch limits on sardines when the population is so low and fulfill its September 2013 commitment to prohibit unregulated fishing on forage fish species such as sand lance, saury, and lanternfish that are not currently managed or monitored. The Pacific Fishery Management Council should cause for concern because populations of forage fish along the West Coast fluctuate widely, so a species can be abundant one year and dwindle unexpectedly the next. The Pacific sardine fishery, immortalized in John Steinbeck’s novel Cannery Row, collapsed notoriously the 1950s. The November 2013 population estimate of 378,000 tons is the lowest in more than a decade, far below the peak of 1.5 million tons estimated in 2000 and a major decline by historical standards. Geological records of fish scales deposited off Southern California indicate that the unfished sardine population fluctuated naturally between a low of 400,000 tons to as much as 16 million tons. The Pacific sardine fishery is a critical component of the marine ecosystem, providing a vital source of food for commercially important predators such as salmon and tuna. The decline of Pacific sardines has far-reaching consequences, including the decline of West Coast seabirds, whales, sharks, dolphins, and commercially important fish such as salmon and tuna. The decline also raises the potential", "answers": ["The West Coast sardine population was down 72% since 2006 per a fall assessment—the worst crash since the mid-20th century, and one with far-reaching implications, particularly since the steep decline is expected to continue. One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing. Last month, Pew Charitable Trusts warned that dozens of species, including whales, sharks, dolphins, salmon, and tuna, could feel an impact."], "length": 25655}
