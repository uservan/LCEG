This is because the model is not designed to handle such changes, and the attacker can use these changes to manipulate the model's output. In particular, the attacker can use misspellings to flip the model's prediction, which can lead to a significant degradation in the model's performance.

This is done by the neutral backoff variant, which returns a fixed neutral word whenever the ScRNN predicts an UNK.
