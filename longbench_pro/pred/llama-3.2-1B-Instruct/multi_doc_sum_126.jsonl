Welcome to the 12th meeting of the House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic. This will be the first hybrid meeting of the committee. Some members will be participating via videoconference and some will be participating in person. This follows the order made by the House on May26,2020. Members who have already participated in a virtual meeting of the special committee may actually not notice any change, except for the fact that some members are also participating from the floor of the House. An additional rubric, that of statements by members, was also added to the proceedings of the committee. In order to ensure that those joining the meeting via video conference can be seen and heard by those in the chamber, two screens have been set up in the chamber on either side of the Speakers chair. Sound amplification for virtual interventions will be available, and members in the chamber can listen to the floor sound or interpretation using the earpieces on their desks. Before speaking, please wait until I recognize you by name. Please also direct your remarks through the Chair. Thank you. For those of you joining via video conference, I would like to remind you to leave your mike on mute when you are not speaking. Also, please note that if you want to speak in English, you should be on the English channel. If you want to speak French, you should be on the French channel. Should you wish to alternate between the two languages, you should change the channel to the language that you are speaking each time you switch languages. Should members participating by videoconference need to request the floor outside their designated speaking times, they should activate their microphone and state that they have a point of order. Those in the chamber can simply rise in the usual way. Please note that today's proceedings will be televised in the same way as a typical sitting of the House. Next we'll move on to ministerial announcements. I understand that there are no ministerial announcements today, so we'll move on to petitions. We'll be presenting petitions for a period not exceeding 15 minutes. I would like to remind members that any petition presented during a meeting of the special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions. For members participating in person, we ask that they please come and drop the signed certificates off at the table once the petitions are presented.

The act authorizes the Small Business Administration (SBA) to provide assistance to small businesses, including loan guarantees and venture capital programs. The SBA also administers several types of programs to support small businesses, including contracting programs to increase small business opportunities in federal contracting and direct loan programs for businesses, homeowners, and renters to assist their recovery from natural disasters. The SBA's Office of Government Contracting Area Office (Area Office) serves the area in which the headquarters of the offeror is located, initially reviewing the protest and determining the offeror's size status within 15 business days after receipt of the protest. The SBA's commercial market representatives conduct periodic compliance reviews of contractors awarded contracts that require an acceptable small business subcontracting plan. The SBA's business opportunity specialists provide guidance, counseling, and referrals for assistance with technical, management, financial, or other matters intended to improve the competitive viability of SBA 8(a) program participants. The SBA's Surety Bond Guarantee program aims to increase small businesses' access to federal, state, and local government contracting, as well as private-sector contracts, by guaranteeing bid, performance, and payment bonds for small businesses that cannot obtain surety bonds through regular commercial channels.\nThe SBA's 8(a) Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development Program (commonly known as the 8(a) program) provides business development assistance to businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals participating in the SBA's Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development Program.

The hotel itself had a great restaurant - on the young side - and the rooms were small. Advertising themselves as suites was quite surprising - two rooms that when put together could be one room in another hotel. We checked for bedbugs, but thankfully there were none. Although nothing bad happened during our stay, we would be hard pressed to return. The views from our balcony were wonderful of the Vancouver harbor, but that was its only saving grace. Review #10:\nThe hotel was far superior to the other Sandman Hotel located across from GM Place. We had a nice city view room, which included a separate bedroom, kitchen, two TVs, and a balcony. The room was clean and very well appointed, it was not luxurious but very clean and modern looking. The outdoor pool is very nice as well as the spa area. The staff were super friendly and the food at Moxies was great. The location is ideal if you are into Davie St. close to lots of restaurants, bars, and shops. It is about a 15-20 minute walk to Robson St. shopping, and less than a 10 minute walk to English Bay beach. Review #11:\nWe were happy at this hotel. Nice sized rooms, with kitchenette and balcony. Staff were friendly and compared to other hotels in Vancouver- the price is good value. Great to have the restuarant chain Moxies downstairs (I'm obsessed with their bellinis!). I loved the location in downtown, its close to shops, yaletown, false creek, english bay and stanley park. However some people who are more challenged in the walking department might find some locations of stanley park, robson st, coal harbour and gas town a bit too far to walk from this hotel (not me tho! - nearly all locals walk from A to B in Vancouver).

The expedition found 11 of the snakes, and DNA tests confirmed that the Clarion Island snake is a unique species, reports the BBC. The snake is related to snakes found on part of the Mexican coast more than 500 miles away, and researchers believe its ancestors may have arrived on a tree trunk washed out to sea long ago. Beebe returned from a visit to the island, located 400-plus miles off Mexico's Pacific coast, nearly 80 years ago with a snake preserved in a jar, but his sample had long been considered a labeling error and his find was largely struck from taxonomic registries.

Al-Nusra has launched more than 40 successful bombing attacks against mainly government military targets, often using suicide bombers, and has been tagged a terrorist organization by the Obama administration because of its links with al-Qaeda. Al-Baghdadi said that Al-Nusra's ties with Al Qaeda were kept obscure for security reasons and to provide Syrians the opportunity to judge the jihadist fighters through their own eyes as opposed to through the filter of a biased international media that would immediately have dismissed them. The evidence on the ground is that Al-Nusra has been able to swell its ranks with homegrown fighters as well foreigners drawn from elsewhere in the Middle East, North Africa, and Central Asia and with a sprinkling from Europe. The Obama administration, which took major criticism from Syrian rebels for tagging Al-Nusra a terrorist organization, will likely highlight Al-Baghdadi's remarks as final justification for its designation. Al-Baghdadi is a highly effective if brutal leader. He has been responsible for directing large-scale operations in Iraq such as the August 28, 2011 attack on the Umm al-Qura mosque in Baghdad that killed prominent Sunni lawmaker Khalid al-Fahdawi.

But it may be the one thing the justice can do to help prevent a President Trump.\" His entire take here. The New York Times editorial board notes that Ginsburg has done nothing illegal—but it's sort of siding with Trump on this one. The paper points out that Antonin Scalia's recent death in an election year makes a new president's possible influence in picking a new justice especially critical.

{"pred": "Passage 4:\nThe Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act), as amended, establishes the process for states or tribal entities to request a presidential disaster declaration. The act generally defines the federal government’s role during the response and recovery after a disaster and establishes the programs and process through which the federal government provides disaster assistance to state, local governments, tribal entities, and individuals. In addition to its central role in recommending to the President whether to declare a disaster, FEMA has primary responsibility for coordinating the federal response when a disaster is declared as well as recovery, which typically consists of providing grants to assist state and tribal entities to alleviate the damage resulting from such disasters. Once a disaster is declared, FEMA provides assistance through the IA, Public Assistance, and Hazard Mitigation Assistance programs. For instance, some declarations may provide grants only for IA and others only for Public Assistance. Hazard Mitigation Assistance grants, on the other hand, are available for all declarations if the affected area has a FEMA-approved Hazard Mitigation plan. The process for requesting assistance is the same for the three types of assistance. Under the Stafford Act, states’ governors or tribal chief executives may request federal assistance, if state and tribal resources are overwhelmed after a disaster. As part of the request to the President, a governor or tribal chief executive must affirm that the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies have implemented an emergency plan and that the situation is of such severity and magnitude that effective response is beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies, among other things. After a state or tribe submits a request for disaster declaration through FEMA’s regional office, the regional office is to evaluate the request and make a regional recommendation through the RVAR, which is submitted to FEMA headquarters for further review. The FEMA administrator then is to review the state’s or tribe’s request and the RVAR, and recommend to the President whether a disaster declaration is warranted. Figure 1 shows the process for a disaster declaration from the time a disaster occurs until the President approves or denies a declaration request. The IA program provides financial and direct assistance to disaster victims for expenses and needs that cannot be met through other means, such as insurance. The IA comprises five different programs as shown below. When states or tribal entities request disaster declarations, they may request assistance under any or all of the five programs. Likewise, when the President makes a disaster declaration, the declaration may authorize IA which may also include any or all of the five IA programs. 1.

The Maximum Absorbency Garment system, donned by Gemini and Apollo astronauts, featured one very specific element: a sleeve likened to a condom with a hole at the tip that enabled the men to urinate into a pouch with a one-way valve in their suits. Three sleeve sizes were available, small, medium, and large. And astronauts couldn't fib, explains Rethke. If they decided to order the next size up, the sheath wouldn't fit snugly, and liquid could potentially leak out, causing damage. To make the process a little less embarrassing, the sizes were later renamed: large, gigantic, and humongous. Motherboard notes that the urination issue was first brought to the fore by Alan Shepard, who spent hours in the Freedom 7 capsule in advance of a quick 15-minute \"suborbital hop.\" Denied permission to leave the capsule, he opted to pee in his suit—forcing Mission Control to turn off his biomedical sensors until the flow of oxygen in the suit dried the pee, allowing the sensors to be switched on.

The devices—which were discovered by two men who found the backpack on top of a garbage can outside a restaurant near the Elizabeth station—will be closely examined for evidence linking them to explosive devices found in New York City and elsewhere in New Jersey over the weekend. A round-up of coverage: Elizabeth Mayor Christian Bollwage says the two men thought the backpack held something of value and carried it some distance before realizing it held explosive devices and calling police, NJ.com.

{"pred": "Passage 5:\nThe Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA) requires that private-sector firms provide workers' compensation coverage for their employees engaged in longshore, harbor, or other maritime occupations on or adjacent to the navigable waters of the United States. The LHWCA is a workers' compensation system and not a federal benefits program. The LHWCA ensures that all covered workers are provided medical and disability benefits in the event they are injured or become ill in the course of their employment, and it provides benefits to the survivors of covered workers who die on the job. In 2016, the LHWCA paid approximately $1.41 billion in cash and medical benefits to injured workers and the families of deceased workers. Nearly all private- and public-sector workers in the United States are covered by some form of workers' compensation. The federal government has a limited role in workers' compensation and administers workers' compensation programs only for federal employees and several classes of private-sector workers, including longshore and harbor workers. For most occupations, workers' compensation is mandated by state laws and administered by state agencies. There is no federal standard for state workers' compensation systems. However, all U.S. workers' compensation systems provide for limited wage replacement and full medical benefits for workers who are injured or become ill as a result of their work and survivors benefits to the families of workers who die on the job. Workers' compensation in the United States is a no-fault system that pays workers for employment-related injuries or illnesses without considering the culpability of any one party. In exchange for this no-fault protection and the guarantee of benefits in the event of an employment-related injury, workers give up their rights to bring actions against employers in the civil court system and give up their rights to seek damages for injuries and illnesses, including pain and suffering, outside of those provided by the workers' compensation laws. Workers' compensation is mandatory in all states and the District of Columbia, with the exception of Texas. In Texas, employers may, under certain conditions, opt out of the workers' compensation system, but in doing so subject themselves to civil actions brought by injured employees. Prior to the enactment of the LHWCA in 1927, longshore and harbor workers were not covered by any workers' compensation system.

{"pred": "Passage 5:\nThe World Trade Organization (WTO) is an international organization that administers the trade rules and agreements negotiated by its 164 members to eliminate trade barriers and create nondiscriminatory rules to govern trade. The WTO encompasses and expanded on the commitments and institutional functions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which was established in 1947 by the United States and 22 other nations. The WTO provides a negotiating forum where members reduce barriers and try to sort out their trade problems. The WTO dispute settlement process is more formalized and enforceable than the GATT process. The WTO has three broad functions: administering the rules of the trading system, establishing new rules through negotiations, and resolving disputes between member states. The WTO core principles are enshrined in a series of trade agreements that include rules and commitments specific to each agreement, subject to various exceptions. The WTO agreements apply the GATT principles of nondiscrimination and the notion that freer trade through the gradual reduction of trade barriers strengthens the world economy and increases prosperity. The WTO has expanded rulemaking to several areas of international trade, but does not extensively cover some key areas, including multilateral investment rules, trade-related labor or environment issues, and emerging issues like digital trade or the commercial role of state-owned enterprises. The Marrakesh Agreement is the umbrella agreement under which the various agreements, annexes, commitment schedules, and understandings reside. The Marrakesh Agreement itself created the WTO as a legal international organization and sets forth its functions, structure, secretariat, budget procedures, decisionmaking, accession, entry-into-force, withdrawal, and other provisions. The WTO's effectiveness as a negotiating body for broad-based trade liberalization has come under intensified scrutiny, as has its role in resolving trade disputes. The WTO has often struggled to reach consensus over issues that can place developed countries against developing countries (such as agricultural subsidies, industrial goods tariffs, and intellectual property rights protection). The WTO has also struggled to address newer trade barriers, such as digital trade restrictions and the role of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in international commerce, which have become more prominent in the years since the WTO was established. The WTO arguably has been more successful in the negotiation of discrete items to which not all participants must agree or be bound (such as plurilateral agreements).

This program is the primary federal government effort to help individuals with disabilities prepare for and obtain employment. An individual who is deemed eligible works with state VR agency staff to prepare an individualized plan for employment, which describes the employment goal and the specific services needed to achieve that goal. Education's Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) awards funds to state VR agencies through the program to help individuals with disabilities engage in gainful employment. States must provide a 21.3 percent nonfederal match of these funds. In fiscal year 2016, total program funds for VR—including state match funds—were $3.81 billion. States, territories, and the District of Columbia generally designate a single agency to administer the program, although, depending on state law, states may designate more than one agency. Twenty-three states have two separate agencies, one that exclusively serves blind and visually impaired individuals (known as agencies for the blind) and another that serves individuals who are not blind or visually impaired (known as general agencies). Twenty-seven states, the District of Columbia, and the five territories have a single combined agency that serves both blind and visually impaired individuals and individuals with other types of impairments (known as combined agencies). In total, there are 79 state VR agencies. In 2014, WIOA amended the Rehabilitation Act to require state VR agencies to provide students with disabilities with pre-employment transition services. According to information Education provided with its regulations, WIOA emphasized the provision of services to students with disabilities to ensure that they have meaningful opportunities to receive training and other supports and services they need to achieve employment outcomes.

The backpack was found in a nearby restaurant and exploded early Monday as a bomb squad was attempting to disarm it with a robot. The explosion was not a controlled blast, but happened unintentionally as the robot was cutting the device. No one was injured in the blast, Bollwage said. Authorities found five devices inside a single backpack near the train station, including one that was detonated. After the explosion, press and bystanders were moved back because the four other explosive devices inside of the backpack were still believed to be live, Bollwage said. No other explosions were heard as of 5 a.m. The incident unfolded after two men found the backpack in a waste basket on North Broad Street and Julian Place around 8 p.m. Sunday, the mayor said. The men took the backpack \"because they thought it was of some value,\" walked for a bit, then saw wires and a pipe, dropped the package and notified Elizabeth police, he said. Bollwage told reporters the explosives were originally found in the trash can about 300 feet from the door of Willy's Place near the train station in the city of about 125,000, which is also the Union County seat. \"If that pub was crowded and there was a lot of people there, it could have severely injured, killed and maimed many, many people,\" Bollwage said. Bollwage said the Elizabeth devices did not contain a cell phone or any other electronic detonators. After the items were found, Union County's Bomb Squad was called in and used a drone to examine the backpack, the mayor said. \"The drone indicated it could be suspicious and it could be a live bomb,\" Bollwage said. When asked if he ever thought Elizabeth would be the target of such an attack, Bollwage said he was not sure the city was the intended target and that the devices could have instead been dumped by a person who realized he or she was being investigated. \"I'm not willing to admit Elizabeth is a terror target,\" Bollwage said. \"Because of the location, it's very possible someone was trying to get rid of package as opposed to set it off.\" Bollwage said FBI agents are reviewing surveillance footage from the restaurant near the trash can where the backpack was first found by the two men.

The devices—which were discovered by two men who found the backpack on top of a garbage can outside a restaurant near the Elizabeth station—will be closely examined for evidence linking them to explosive devices found in New York City and elsewhere in New Jersey over the weekend. A round-up of coverage: Elizabeth Mayor Christian Bollwage says the two men thought the backpack held something of value and carried it some distance before realizing it held explosive devices and calling police, NJ.com. He says in its original location near a pub, the devices could have caused carnage. \"If that pub was crowded and there was a lot of people there, it could have severely injured, killed and maimed many, many people,\" the mayor says.

The fund also accumulates revenues from the federal motorboat fuel tax and surplus property sales. However, revenues that accrue under the LWCF Act are available only if appropriated by Congress through the discretionary appropriations process. The LWCF receives additional revenue (beyond the $900 million) from OCS leasing under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (GOMESA).

{"pred": "Passage 3:\nThe Navy's proposed FY2020 budget submission proposed to not fund the mid-life nuclear refueling overhaul (called a Refueling Complex Overhaul, or RCOH) for the aircraft carrier CVN-75 (Harry S. Truman), and to instead retire the ship around FY2024 and deactivate one of the Navy's carrier air wings at about the same time. The Administration announced that it was effectively withdrawing this proposal from the Navy's FY2020 budget submission. The Navy states that the CVN-75 RCOH can no longer begin in FY2024, as planned prior to the Navy's FY2020 budget submission, because the Navy spent the months prior to April 30, planning for the ship's deactivation rather than for giving it an RCOH. As a result, the CVN-75 will now begin a year later, in FY2025. The funding stream for the CVN-75 shown in Table A-1 will also shift one year to the right, and the CVN-75 RCOH can be reinstated without any funding in FY2020, because FY2020 is effectively the same as FY2019 in Table A-1. The Navy's FY2020 30-year (FY2020-FY2049) shipbuilding plan, reflecting the proposal to not fund the CVN-75 RCOH, projected that the carrier force would remain at 11 ships through FY2024, decline to 10 ships in FY2025, and remain at 10 ships for the remainder of the 30-year period, except for a few years (FY2027, FY2040-FY2044, and FY2046-FY2048) when it would temporarily decline to 9 ships. The accelerated delivery date for CVN-81, combined with the unchanged year of procurement for CVN-82, suggests that the interval between the construction of CVN-81 and construction of CVN-82 could result in increased loss of learning in shifting from construction of CVN-81 to construction of CVN-82, and possibly in reduced spreading of shipyard fixed overhead costs during the construction of CVN-82.

And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts—the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post—isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them.

{"pred": "Passage 4:\nThe Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is an agency of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) that insures private mortgage lenders against the possibility of borrowers defaulting on certain mortgage loans. The FHA insurance protects the lender, rather than the borrower, in the event of borrower default. To be eligible for FHA insurance, the mortgage must be originated by a lender that has been approved by FHA, and the mortgage and the borrower must meet certain criteria. The FHA is one of three government agencies that provide insurance or guarantees on certain home mortgages made by private lenders, along with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). The availability or attractiveness of FHA-insured mortgages may be limited by other factors, such as the maximum mortgage amount that FHA will insure, the fees that it charges for insurance, and its eligibility standards. This report provides background on FHA's history and market role and an overview of the basic eligibility and underwriting criteria for FHA-insured home loans. It also provides data on the number and dollar volume of mortgages that FHA insures, along with data on FHA's market share in recent years. The report does not go into detail on the financial status of the FHA mortgage insurance fund. For information on FHA's financial position, see CRS Report R42875, FHA Single-Family Mortgage Insurance: Financial Status of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMI Fund). The Federal Housing Administration was created by the National Housing Act of 1934, during the Great Depression, to encourage lending for housing and to stimulate the construction industry. Prior to the creation of FHA, few mortgages exceeded 50% of the property's value and most mortgages were written for terms of five years or less. Furthermore, mortgages were typically not structured to be fully repaid by the end of the loan term; rather, at the end of the five-year term, the remaining loan balance had to be paid in a lump sum or the mortgage had to be renegotiated. During the Great Depression, lenders were unable or unwilling to refinance many of the loans that became due. Thus, many borrowers lost their homes through foreclosure, and lenders lost money because property values were falling. Lenders became wary of the mortgage market. FHA institutionalized a new idea: 20-year mortgages on which the loan would be completely repaid at the end of the loan term. If borrowers defaulted, FHA insured that the lender would be fully repaid.

Business loan credit subsidies represent the net present value of cash flows to and from the SBA over the life of the agency's loan portfolios.

The U.S. government distributes trade-related information to exporters, conducts foreign country market research, and provides counseling to U.S. companies throughout the export process. The U.S. agencies may also use diplomatic tools to advocate on behalf of U.S. companies to help ensure they can compete on a level playing field in export markets.

Congress has restricted the use of funds that are generally appropriated for State, Commerce, and USDA from being used to promote the sale or export of U.S. tobacco and tobacco products since the 1990s. In 1990, we reported that U.S. policy and programs for assisting the export of tobacco and tobacco products worked at cross purposes to U.S. health policy and initiatives, both domestically and internationally. Congress later restricted the use of funds that are generally appropriated to State, Commerce, and USDA from being used to promote the sale or export of tobacco or tobacco products. During fiscal years 1994 through 2003, Congress prohibited funds generally appropriated for USDA through annual appropriations acts from being used to promote the sale or export of tobacco or tobacco products. In fiscal year 2004, Congress permanently prohibited funds appropriated for USDA from being used to promote the sale or export of tobacco or tobacco products.

At the time, Lacy concluded that DNA evidence found on JonBenet's underwear and long johns belonged to a male intruder who was not part of the Ramsey family. But now three forensic experts who examined the DNA test results and lab reports used by Lacy say they do not support her conclusion. For one thing, a sample on her underwear identified as coming from \"Unknown Male 1\" may in fact be a composite from multiple people and thus \"worthless as evidence,\" says the news report.

Truman), and to instead retire the ship around FY2024 and deactivate one of the Navy's carrier air wings at about the same time. The Navy states that the CVN-75 RCOH can no longer begin in FY2024, as planned prior to the Navy's FY2020 budget submission, because the Navy spent the months prior to April 30 planning for the ship's deactivation rather than for giving it an RCOH. As a result, the Navy states, the CVN-75 will now begin a year later, in FY2025. As a consequence of this one-year shift in the schedule for the RCOH, the funding stream for the CVN-75 shown in Table A-1 will also shift one year to the right, and the CVN-75 RCOH can be reinstated without any funding in FY2020, because FY2020 is effectively the same as FY2019 in Table A-1. Performing an RCOH on a carrier is needed for the carrier to operate for the second half of its intended 50-year service life. Not performing an RCOH on CVN-75 would mean that, instead of remaining in service for the second half of its intended 50-year service life, the ship would be decommissioned, permanently removed from service, and eventually dismantled.

While the dwarf planet tries to fight its way back into the good graces of Those Who Deem What Counts as a Planet, another icy orb even further out may snatch that designation first. Astronomers at the California Institute of Technology say a giant celestial body \"lurking at the end of our solar system,\" as the Washington Post puts it, may actually be a planet, and they're even already calling it \"Planet Nine.\" In their research published in the Astronomical Journal, the sky-watching scientists—one of whom is known as the \"Pluto killer\" for his role in getting Pluto demoted—think their find is five to 10 times as massive as Earth, and per the AP, almost as big as Neptune and orbiting billions of miles past that planet's orbit. Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal. Now they're simply hoping more astronomers join in to actually try to spot the alleged planet—and they're not concerned it will face Pluto's fate. \"That's not even a question—it's definitely a planet,\" Brown says. Not everyone's convinced. \"I have seen many, many such claims in my career,\" a planetary scientist at Colorado's Southwest Research Institute tells Nature. \"And all of them have been wrong.\" (The Washington Post caught up with Brown for a Q&A on the latest Pluto-killing endeavor.)"], "length": 109115}

According to NASA's calculations, its New Horizons spacecraft flew by Pluto at 31,000mph at 7:49am EDT today; confirmation of that will come tonight, some 13 hours later, reports the AP. The confirmation will mark the completion of NASA's tour of the \"classical nine\" planets, reports the AP, which notes that Pluto was considered a full-fledged planet instead of a dwarf one when the probe began its journey in 2006. Some things to know about the historic flyby, which comes 50 years to the day after the first successful flyby of Mars: New Horizons will have to capture a vast amount of data in a short time. The probe will be pushed to its limits as it pivots to capture photos and information on Pluto and its moons Charon, Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra during the flyby. \"I can't wait to get into the data and really start making sense of it. Right now, we're just standing under the waterfall and enjoying it,\" principal New Horizons scientist Alan Stern tells the BBC. We don't know whether it was a success. The probe is far too busy to \"phone home,\" the AP notes, but it's expected to send a confirmation signal at around 9pm tonight. The eagerly awaited first photos from the flyby should be released tomorrow night, the Guardian reports, though it will take 16 months to send all the data from the flyby back to Earth. We've already learned a lot of new things about Pluto. \"The science we've already made is mouth-watering,\" says Stern. \"The Pluto system is enchanting in its strangeness and its alien beauty.\" Among NASA's findings in recent days: Pluto's North Pole has an icy cap and the planet's diameter is 1,597 miles across, not 1,471 miles as previously thought. The finding suggests the planet contains a lot more ice and a lot less rock than thought, the Christian Science Monitor reports. There are still a lot of mysteries to be solved. Scientists hope the first close-up look at Pluto's surface will explain features like heart- and doughnut-shaped features recently spotted for the first time. LiveScience notes that new information from Pluto could help explain how our own planet formed and how life began. \"There's a feeling among scientists that Pluto probably will tell us what the early solar system looked like and it's now locked in deep freeze and maybe it will tell us what we once were, a long time ago,\" the director of the Deep Space Communication Complex tells Reuters. The Australian facility will be first to receive new information from the spacecraft. New Horizons isn't done.

Try December of that year, when Steve Carell boarded John McCain's campaign bus \"and changed the entire trajectory\" of the show, writes Chris Smith at Vanity Fair. The article is a fascinating oral history of the show's beginning that includes interviews with Stewart, Carell, Stephen Colbert, and pretty much everyone involved. The first year was rough for Stewart as he fought with the holdover writing staff from previous host Craig Kilborn and sought to put his stamp on the show. Things came together in that Carell interview, in which he peppers McCain with softball questions, then springs a policy zinger. After a few seconds of awkward silence, Carell says, \"I was just kidding! I don’t even know what that means!\" And the tense moment subsides. (See the clip.) Carell: \"It was making fun of a gotcha moment. And I think that a lot of what we do on The Daily Show is making fun of journalistic tropes, and I think that was one of them.\" Head writer Ben Karlin: \"I remember seeing it in the editing room. I remember Jon called me down, and seeing it and thinking, Yeah, this is what we should be doing. This is the goal. It was one of Carell’s most incredible moments. He asks McCain a question in a way that no journalists were talking to the candidates. And it was like, Oh s---, we are able, in this weird, unintentional way, to add a level of insight to the process that doesn’t exist. That was really, really exciting.\" Click for the full piece, in which Stewart talks about how that 2000 campaign provided his \"aha moment\" of how to present the show—by \"deconstructing the process.\""], "length": 108893}

Sources tell the Wall Street Journal that the document was prepared by Christopher Steele, a former Russia expert in Britain's spy service who founded the Orbis Business Intelligence research firm in 2009. The New York Times, in a look at how the dossier came to light, reports that Steele was hired by Washington research firm Fusion GPS, which was hired by a wealthy GOP donor in the fall of 2015 to compile anti-Trump material. After Trump became the presumptive nominee, the GOP donor no longer needed the research firm's services, but wealthy Democratic donors stepped in, and Steele continued to send monthly memos detailing alleged Russian efforts to both compromise Trump and assist his campaign, per the Times' sources. In other coverage: The Guardian looks at John McCain's involvement, which apparently included clandestine efforts to obtain the dossier after hearing about it from a diplomat during a conference in Canada. \"Upon examination of the contents, and unable to make a judgment about their accuracy, I delivered the information to the director of the FBI,\" McCain said in a statement Wednesday. The AP reports that it has been unable to contact Steele. A neighbor of the former spy, who lives outside London, says Steele and his family are away and it's not clear when they will return. Intelligence chiefs are defending their decision to take the very unusual step of attaching a summary of the unverified dossier to last week's briefing on Russian hacking, the Washington Post reports. \"Part of our obligation is to ensure that policymakers are provided with the fullest possible picture of any matters that might affect national security,\" Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Wednesday. He said he spoke with Trump and expressed dismay at the \"extremely corrosive\" leaks in the press. Early Thursday, Trump tweeted that Clapper had called him \"to denounce the false and fictitious report that was illegally circulated.\" He added: \"Made up, phony facts.Too bad!\" Politico looks at how Democrats are dealing with Trump's Russia troubles. So far, senators have been more restrained than House members, some of whom have started referring to Trump as \"Moscow Donald.\" The New York Times reports that Trump is facing a backlash from Jewish groups for wondering if we \"are living in Nazi Germany\" when he was criticizing intelligence agencies' handling of what he called \"fake news.\" At the Intercept, Glenn Greenwald calls the dossier \"farcical\" and warns that this episode could backfire badly for Democratic operatives and others treating the dossier as gospel.

Title I—FCC Administration and Powers. The 1934 Act originally called for a commission consisting of seven members, but that number was reduced to five in 1983. Commissioners are appointed by the President and approved by the Senate to serve five-year terms; the President designates one member to serve as chairman.

Common carriers are communication companies that provide facilities for transmission but do not originate messages, such as telephone and microwave providers. The 1934 Act limits FCC regulation to interstate and international common carriers, although a joint federal-state board coordinates regulation between the FCC and state regulatory commissions.

In 2012, an illegal armed group occupied the city of Goma and other cities in the eastern DRC and clashed with the Congolese national army. The United Nations reported numerous cases of sexual violence against civilians, including women and children, perpetrated by armed groups and some members of the Congolese national military.

For example, tin is used to solder metal pieces and is also found in food packaging, steel coatings on automobile parts, and some plastics. Tungsten is used in automobile manufacturing, drill bits and cutting tools, and other industrial manufacturing tools and is the primary component of filaments in incandescent light bulbs. Most tantalum is used to manufacture capacitors that enable energy storage in electronic products such as cell phones and computers or to produce alloy additives used in turbines in jet engines. Gold is held as bullion by central bank reserves and used in making jewelry and also in the electronics industry, for example, to manufacture cell phones and laptops.

Sources tell the Wall Street Journal that the document was prepared by Christopher Steele, a former Russia expert in Britain's spy service who founded the Orbis Business Intelligence research firm in 2009. The New York Times, in a look at how the dossier came to light, reports that Steele was hired by Washington research firm Fusion GPS, which was hired by a wealthy GOP donor in the fall of 2015 to compile anti-Trump material. After Trump became the presumptive nominee, the GOP donor no longer needed the research firm's services, but wealthy Democratic donors stepped in, and Steele continued to send monthly memos detailing alleged Russian efforts to both compromise Trump and assist his campaign, per the Times' sources. In other coverage: The Guardian looks at John McCain's involvement, which apparently included clandestine efforts to obtain the dossier after hearing about it from a diplomat during a conference in Canada. \"Upon examination of the contents, and unable to make a judgment about their accuracy, I delivered the information to the director of the FBI,\" McCain said in a statement Wednesday. The AP reports that it has been unable to contact Steele. A neighbor of the former spy, who lives outside London, says Steele and his family are away and it's not clear when they will return.

The FHA is the most broadly targeted, with FHA being the most broadly targeted. The FHA was established by the National Housing Act of 1934, during the Great Depression, to encourage lending for housing and to stimulate the construction industry. Prior to the creation of FHA, few mortgages exceeded 50% of the property's value and most mortgages were written for terms of five years or less. The FHA institutionalized a new idea: 20-year mortgages on which the loan would be completely repaid at the end of the loan term. If borrowers defaulted, FHA insured that the lender would be fully repaid. By standardizing mortgage instruments and setting certain standards for mortgages, the creation of FHA was meant to instill confidence in the mortgage market and help to stimulate investment in housing and the overall economy. The creation of FHA was a response to the Great Depression, and it was intended to provide a safety net for borrowers who were struggling to make ends meet. The FHA was also a response to the lack of access to credit for minority and low-income groups, who were often excluded from the mortgage market. The FHA's creation was a significant step forward in the development of the mortgage market, and it paved the way for the creation of other government-backed mortgage insurance programs.

That finding stems from an analysis of 15,632 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study II over a 10-year period beginning in 1991. A press release explains the women had not previously had gestational diabetes, and at four-year intervals answered questions related to their diet in the year prior. Under the potato category, they were asked to rate their consumption of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes, fries, or potato chips on a scale of \"never\" to \"six or more times a day.\" The researchers begin their study by noting just how prevalent potato consumption is, with 35% of American women ages 19-50 eating potatoes daily, and the vegetable accounting for 8% of their caloric intake. Study author Dr. Cuilin Zhang recommends to CBS News that women cap it at one potato portion per week and consider a swap.

The argument for reinstatement is based on the idea that Pluto is not a planet, but rather a dwarf planet. The argument is based on the definition of a planet, which is a celestial body that orbits the Sun and is massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity. Pluto does not meet this definition, as it is much smaller than the other planets in our solar system and has not cleared the neighborhood around its orbit. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) has also weighed in on the issue, stating that Pluto is not a planet and should be classified as a dwarf planet. The argument for reinstatement is based on the idea that the IAU's definition of a planet is too narrow and does not take into account the diversity of celestial bodies in our solar system.\n\nPassage 2:\nThe Federal Housing Administration (FHA) has obligated more than $5 billion in bilateral assistance to the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza since 1993.

The 114th Congress began but did not complete a 2016 child nutrition reauthorization, and there was no significant legislative activity with regard to reauthorization in the 115th Congress. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Service (USDA-FNS) administers the programs at the federal level. The programs are operated by a wide variety of local public and private providers and the degree of direct state involvement differs by program and state. At the state level, education, health, social services, and agriculture departments all have roles; at a minimum, they are responsible for approving and overseeing local providers such as schools, summer program sponsors, and child care centers and day care homes, as well as making sure they receive the federal support they are due. At the local level, program benefits are provided to millions of children (e.g., there were 30.0 million in the National School Lunch Program, the largest of the programs, in FY2017), through some 100,000 public and private schools and residential child care institutions, nearly 170,000 child care centers and family day care homes, and just over 50,000 summer program sites.

VBA provides a variety of benefits to veterans and their families, including disability compensation, educational opportunities, assistance with home ownership, and life insurance. NCA provides burial and memorial benefits to veterans and their families. Collectively, the three components rely on approximately 340,000 employees to provide services and benefits. These employees work in VA’s Washington, D.C. headquarters, as well as 170 medical centers, approximately 750 community-based outpatient clinics, 300 veterans centers, 56 regional offices, and more than 130 cemeteries situated throughout the nation. The use of IT is critically important to VA’s efforts to provide benefits and services to veterans. As such, the department operates and maintains an IT infrastructure that is intended to provide the backbone necessary to meet the day-to-day operational needs of its medical centers, veteran-facing systems, benefits delivery systems, memorial services, and all other systems supporting the department’s mission. The infrastructure is to provide for data storage, transmission, and communications requirements necessary to ensure the delivery of reliable, available, and responsive support to all VA staff offices and administration customers, as well as veterans. According to department data as of October 2016, there were 576 active or in-development systems in VA’s inventory of IT systems. These systems are intended to be used for the determination of benefits, benefits claims processing, and access to health records, among other services. VHA is the parent organization for 319 of these systems. Of the 319 systems, 244 were considered mission-related and provide capabilities related to veterans’ health care delivery. For example, VHA’s systems provide capabilities to establish and maintain electronic health records that health care providers and other clinical staff use to view patient information in inpatient, outpatient, and long-term care settings.

The lake, located in the Gale Crater, would have been about 30 miles long and 3 miles wide. The lake's mudstones—which form in calm, still water—contain traces of sulfur, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and carbon, meaning it could have supported chemolithoautotrophs, a kind of microbial that obtains energy by breaking down rock minerals. The lake was revealed today amidst a barrage of papers on the Rover's progress. National Geographic breaks down some of the other key take-aways, including one that's less promising for Martian life hunters: Curiosity's first radiation measurements indicate levels that would be fatal, within a few million years, to anything within several meters of the surface.

The law is President François Hollande's first major social reform and a key election pledge. The legislation, which is President Hollande's first major social reform and a key election pledge, was backed by 329 deputies and opposed by 229. The bill redefines marriage as a contract between two people rather than between a man and a woman. It will now go to the left-wing-controlled Senate, or upper house, on April 2, which is expected to approve it. Once passed, the reform will see France join 11 other gay-marriage friendly countries including Spain, Sweden, South Africa and the Netherlands. Nine US states and Washington DC have also legalised same-sex marriage and British lawmakers have recently voted for marriage equality in the UK. The move is France's biggest social reform since the abolition of the death penalty in 1981. Speaking after the vote, Justice Minister Christiane Taubira told journalists “We've waged a great and noble battle”. The Catholic opposition to the bill has been significant, with some 51% of people supporting same-sex marriage, but less than half agreeing with equal rights involving children. The debate has sparked some of the country's largest protests in decades, with around 340,000 turning out in Paris on January 14 to protest the reform. The anti-gay marriage camp, largely driven by the Catholic Church, has accused President Hollande of pushing through legislation without proper consultation. The bill must be passed by the Senate before it can become law. If passed, it will mark the biggest step forward for French gay rights advocates in more than a decade. France is not the only nation currently wrestling with the polarizing issue of same-sex marriage. UK lawmakers took a big step last week toward legalizing same-sex marriage when they approved the second reading of a bill in the House of Commons. But while a significant number of MPs back the legislation, which is supported by Prime Minister David Cameron, the move has prompted widespread rebellion within Cameron's Conservative Party. The Church of England is among the religious bodies opposed to the UK legislation. In the United States, where President Barack Obama has voiced his personal support for same-sex marriage, it has been legalized in nine states and the District of Columbia -- but many people remain vehemently opposed.

The study includes data on 25 Spanish women scanned before and after their first pregnancies, along with 20 women who didn't get pregnant during the study. The brain changes in the pregnancy group emerged from comparisons of those two groups. The results were consistent: A computer program could tell which women had gotten pregnant just by looking at results of the MRI scans. And the changes, first documented an average of 10 weeks after giving birth, were mostly still present two years after childbirth. (Based on prior research findings, the researchers think the brain changes happened during pregnancy). No brain changes were seen in first-time fathers, reports the AP. What's going on? Elseline Hoekzema, a study author at Leiden University in the Netherlands, and colleagues think the differences result from sex hormones that flood the brain of a pregnant woman. In 11 places in the brain, the MRI data indicate reductions in volume of the brain's gray matter, but it's not clear what that means. For example, it could reflect a pruning of the places where brain cells communicate, called synapses. Losing some synapses is not necessarily a bad thing. It happens during a hormonal surge in adolescence, producing more specialized and efficient brain circuits. The researchers suspect that could be happening in the pregnant women, perhaps to prepare a woman for motherhood.

The story by Josh Meyer alleges that former President Obama gave up more than he acknowledged publicly, particularly in regard to a prisoner swap ahead of the deal. The Obama White House released seven prisoners it characterized as non-dangerous businessmen, neglecting to mention that three of them had been deemed a threat to national security by the president's own Justice Department. (They'd been accused of illegally shipping US macroelectronics to Tehran for use in surface-to-air and cruise missiles.) What's more, Politico found that the US also quietly dropped criminal cases against 14 fugitives, including Seyed Abolfazl Shahab Jamili, who allegedly procured thousands of parts with nuclear applications for Iran by way of China. \"They didn’t just dismiss a bunch of innocent business guys,\" one former federal law enforcement supervisor tells Politico. \"And then they didn’t give a full story of it.\" In fact, Meyer writes, the White House actions \"derailed\" its own successful investigations into Iran's proliferation network, angering Justice Department prosecutors. A senior Obama official acknowledges that anger but says such compromises are necessary and pale in comparison to the greater good of a nuclear deal.

Ford, who was narrowly elected leader of the provincial Progressive Conservative Party in March after former leader Patrick Brown stepped down amid allegations of sexual misconduct, won a resounding victory over current Premier Kathleen Wynne, whose Liberal Party had been in power for 15 years. Ford—who, unlike his brother, isn't known for drinking heavily or smoking crack—campaigned on a populist platform that led to comparisons to President Trump.

{"pred": "Passage 2:\nThe House of Representatives has standing rules that govern how bills and resolutions are taken up and considered on the floor. However, to expedite legislation receiving floor action, the House may temporarily set aside these rules for measures that are not otherwise privileged for consideration. This can be done by agreeing to a special order of business resolution (special rule) or by adopting a motion to suspend the rules and pass the underlying measure. In general, special rules enable the consideration of complex or contentious legislation, such as major appropriations or reauthorizations, while the suspension procedure is usually applied to broadly supported legislation that can be approved without floor amendments or extensive debate in the chamber. Most bills and resolutions that receive floor action in the House are called up and considered under suspension of the rules. The suspension procedure allows nonprivileged measures to be raised without a special rule, waiving points of order, limiting debate, and prohibiting floor amendments. Motions to suspend the rules and pass the measure, though, may provide for passage of the measure in an amended form. That is, the text to be approved may be presented in a form altered by committee amendments or by informal negotiations. Suspension measures, however, may be subject to review and approval by the committee and the full chamber. The decision to suspend the rules is typically made by the Speaker of the House or the presiding officer of the House. The House may consider the measure pursuant to a special rule reported by the Committee on Rules and agreed to by the House. A motion to suspend the rules is a compound motion to suspend the House rules and pass a bill or agree to a resolution. When considering such a motion, the House is voting on the two questions simultaneously. Once recognized, the Member making the motion will say, \"Mr. [or Madam] Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass___.\" The House rules that are suspended under this procedure include those that \"would impede an immediate vote on passage of a measure … such as ordering the previous question, third reading, recommittal, or division of the question.\" A measure considered under the suspension procedure is not subject to floor amendment.

{"pred": "Passage 4:\nThe National Cemeteries Act of 1973 created the modern veterans' cemetery system. NCA, within VA, manages a majority of veterans' cemeteries in the United States. In that role NCA maintains existing national cemeteries and builds new national cemeteries for the nation's veterans and their family members. Since 1978 NCA has also provided funding through VA's Veterans Cemetery Grants Program (Grants Program) to help establish, expand, or improve state and tribal veterans' cemeteries. States and tribal governments seeking funding from the Grants Program must apply to the VA. Any cemetery established, expanded, or improved through funding from VA's Grants Program must be maintained and operated in accordance with NCA's operational standards. Veterans from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and some U.S. territories are served by national, state, or tribal cemeteries. In addition, over time NCA has changed its policies and procedures to better fulfill its mission to serve and honor veterans and their family members. For example, in 2011 NCA lowered its policy threshold for establishing new national cemeteries from an area having at least 170,000 veterans who are unserved by burial options to an area having 80,000 unserved veterans. NCA established this revised policy threshold in recognition that many highly populated areas still lacked reasonable access to a burial option, and based on data and analysis provided by an independent review of VA's burial benefits program in 2008. This revised minimum veteran population threshold was chosen based on data showing that state veterans' cemeteries funded through VA's Grants Program were located in areas that typically served a maximum of 80,000 veterans within a 75-mile service area. According to VA documentation, moving to this lower threshold has enabled the agency to establish new national cemeteries in areas where states may not have been willing to place them because of the size and cost of operating a larger state veterans' cemetery. NCA offers a variety of facilities to meet the burial needs of veterans, including various cemetery configurations that either provide burial options to eligible veterans or improve their access to burial options, as shown in table 1.

Experts relay how casinos track and target addicted gamblers, supply ready flows of cash via on-site ATMs, and offer plenty of perks to keep them coming back. But it's the modern-day slot machines themselves, with deceptive technology called virtual reel mapping, that seem to be designed to lull gamblers into a trance—or what the industry refers to as \"continuous gaming productivity\"—so they don't stop playing.

This program is the primary federal government effort to help individuals with disabilities prepare for and obtain employment. An individual who is deemed eligible works with state VR agency staff to prepare an individualized plan for employment, which describes the employment goal and the specific services needed to achieve that goal. The program provides a 21.3 percent nonfederal match of funds to support VR agencies. In fiscal year 2016, total program funds for VR—including state match funds—were $3.81 billion. States, territories, and the District of Columbia generally designate a single agency to administer the program, although, depending on state law, states may designate more than one agency. Twenty-three states have two separate agencies, one that exclusively serves blind and visually impaired individuals (known as agencies for the blind) and another that serves individuals who are not blind or visually impaired (known as general agencies). Twenty-seven states, the District of Columbia, and the five territories have a single combined agency that serves both blind and visually impaired individuals and individuals with other types of impairments (known as combined agencies). In total, there are 79 state VR agencies. In 2014, WIOA amended the Rehabilitation Act to require state VR agencies to provide students with disabilities with pre-employment transition services. According to information Education provided with its regulations, WIOA emphasized the provision of services to students with disabilities to ensure that they have meaningful opportunities to receive training and other supports and services they need to achieve employment outcomes. WIOA requires states to make pre-employment transition services available statewide to all students with disabilities in need of such services, who are eligible or potentially eligible, regardless of whether a student has submitted an application for services from a state VR agency. In this context, students with disabilities include those with an individualized education program (IEP) for special education services through the school system, those receiving an accommodation for their disability, and others. In information provided with the regulations, Education stated that state VR agencies should work closely with school systems and others to identify students in need of pre-employment transition services.

It was established by the Communications Act of 1934 (1934 Act, or \"Communications Act\") and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable. The mission of the FCC is to ensure that the American people have available, \"without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex, a rapid, efficient, Nationwide, and worldwide wire and radio communication service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges.\" The 1934 Act is divided into titles and sections that describe various powers and concerns of the commission. Title I—FCC Administration and Powers. The 1934 Act originally called for a commission consisting of seven members, but that number was reduced to five in 1983. Commissioners are appointed by the President and approved by the Senate to serve five-year terms; the President designates one member to serve as chairman. Title II—Common carrier regulation, primarily telephone regulation, including circuit-switched telephone services offered by cable companies. Common carriers are communication companies that provide facilities for transmission but do not originate messages, such as telephone and microwave providers. The 1934 Act limits FCC regulation to interstate and international common carriers, although a joint federal-state board coordinates regulation between the FCC and state regulatory commissions. Title III—Broadcast station requirements. Much existing broadcast regulation was established prior to 1934 by the Federal Radio Commission, and most provisions of the Radio Act of 1927 were subsumed into Title III of the 1934 Act. Title IV—Procedural and administrative provisions, such as hearings, joint boards, judicial review of the FCC's orders, petitions, and inquiries. Title V—Penal provisions and forfeitures, such as violations of rules and regulations. Title VI—Cable communications, such as the use of cable channels and cable ownership restrictions, franchising, and video programming services provided by telephone companies.

In that role NCA maintains existing national cemeteries and builds new national cemeteries for the nation’s veterans and their family members. Since 1978 NCA has also provided funding through VA’s Veterans Cemetery Grants Program (Grants Program) to help establish, expand, or improve state and tribal veterans’ cemeteries. States and tribal governments seeking funding from the Grants Program must apply to the VA. Any cemetery established, expanded, or improved through funding from VA’s Grants Program must be maintained and operated in accordance with NCA’s operational standards. Veterans from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and some U.S. territories are served by national, state, or tribal cemeteries. In addition, over time NCA has changed its policies and procedures to better fulfill its mission to serve and honor veterans and their family members. For example, in 2011 NCA lowered its policy threshold for establishing new national cemeteries from an area having at least 170,000 veterans who are unserved by burial options to an area having 80,000 unserved veterans. NCA established this revised policy threshold in recognition that many highly populated areas still lacked reasonable access to a burial option, and based on data and analysis provided by an independent review of VA’s burial benefits program in 2008. This revised minimum veteran population threshold was chosen based on data showing that state veterans’ cemeteries funded through VA’s Grants Program were located in areas that typically served a maximum of 80,000 veterans within a 75-mile service area. According to VA documentation, moving to this lower threshold has enabled the agency to establish new national cemeteries in areas where states may not have been willing to place them because of the size and cost of operating a larger state veterans’ cemetery. NCA offers a variety of facilities to meet the burial needs of veterans, including various cemetery configurations that either provide burial options to eligible veterans or improve their access to burial options, as shown in table 1.

The jury is now in on her remarks, and she may want to appeal. Some thoughts from around the internet: Mark Joseph Stern writes for Slate that Ginsburg's comments have been called \"explosive, unprecedented, and unethical,\" by both liberals and conservatives, and he agrees that what she did was \"dangerous\" as well as a breach of ethics. But he says that's exactly Ginsburg's point, and it may be a strategic one in which she's willing to give up her \"good name\" and \"sacrifice some of her prestige … to send as clear a warning signal about Trump as she possibly can.\" Ginsburg \"abandoned judicial propriety to wrestle in the mud with a candidate she detests,\" he writes. \"It is not pretty, it is not pleasant, and it may not even be that smart. But it may be the one thing the justice can do to help prevent a President Trump.\" His entire take here. The New York Times editorial board notes that Ginsburg has done nothing illegal—but it's sort of siding with Trump on this one. The paper points out that Antonin Scalia's recent death in an election year makes a new president's possible influence in picking a new justice especially critical. It calls it \"baffling\" that Ginsburg would stoop to his level and \"call her own commitment to impartiality into question,\" adding that DC already has enough partisan issues \"without the spectacle of a Supreme Court justice flinging herself into the mosh pit.\" The Washington Post adds that not only were Ginsburg's remarks not illegal, they weren't surprising, given her feminist history, nor were they necessarily untrue. But it agrees with the Times that her \"off-the-cuff\" statements were \"inappropriate\" and probably best never spoken. \"Politicization, real or perceived, undermines public faith in the impartiality of the courts,\" the editorial board writes, citing the Code of Conduct for United States Judges' section on refraining from political activity. \"[Her comments] fall into that limited category of candor that we can't admire, because it's inconsistent with her function in our democratic system.\" Donald Trump himself addressed Ginsburg's shade with the New York Times on Tuesday, but he added more thoughts on Twitter early Wednesday, tweeting, \"Justice Ginsburg of the US Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me.

As predicted by authorities in Haiti, UNESCO experts say there is \"indisputable proof\" that the wreck found off the country's north coast is from a much later period than 1492, reports the BBC. UNESCO says the wreck is further from shore than accounts of Columbus' first voyage, and bronze or copper fasteners found at the site are evidence of shipbuilding techniques that date the ship to the late 17th or 18th century at the earliest. UNESCO says it believes the wreck may lie \"under coastal sediment\" in what is now marshland and has called for further investigation of the area.

Moms and dads, the jobless, students and union members joined together for a day-long protest and general strike that ended in a march to the port where activists blocked shipments, effectively closing operations accounting for some $8.5 million in business a day, reports the Los Angeles Times. Protesters also blocked intersections and pounded on the windows of banks, forcing some to close. \"This is a warning, a test, to the 1%. We don't need them, they need us,\" one of the protesters told the Guardian. Police announced earlier they had made no arrests and the protest was largely peaceful, but cops were keeping careful watch as the night progressed. “The world is watching Oakland tonight. We need to make sure this remains a safe place for everyone,” said City Administrator Deanna Santana. Initially, police were notably restrained just days after a rubber bullet shot by cops fractured the skull of former Marine Scott Olsen, who is still hospitalized with serious head trauma.

Turns out we're not as special as we thought. A type of bat also displays this hemispheric specialization when it comes to sound processing, Washington has discovered. In both humans and Parnell's mustached bats—a species that lives in an area ranging from Mexico to Brazil, RedOrbit reports—the left hemisphere handles quicker sounds, while the right deals with slower ones, a press release reports. For humans, the right hemisphere \"may allow us to identify who is speaking, to gauge their emotional state via tone of voice, and to tease out pitch in music,\" Washington notes. As for the left hemisphere, \"men largely use just the left hemisphere\" to process language, while women use both hemispheres to do so, Washington says. In mustached bats—named based on the hair springing from the sides of their snouts, Animal Diversity Web explains—the right hemisphere's slower processing is used for sonar, \"which relies on detecting small changes in frequency,\" says Washington, senior author of the study in Frontiers in Neuroscience. The left is used \"to distinguish communication sounds from each other, because (the bats') communication sounds have rapid changes in frequency.\" All this is more than just a matter of interest: The findings could help study human language disorders, especially since some study techniques \"can only be permitted in animals,\" Washington adds.

{"pred": "Passage 5:\nThe Runaway Youth Act of 1974 was a federal law that aimed to assist runaways and homeless youth by providing services specifically for this population. The law was enacted to address the growing number of homeless youth in the United States. The Act authorized federal funding to be provided through annual appropriations for three programs: the Basic Center Program, Transitional Living Program, and Street Outreach Program. The programs were designed to provide support for runaway and homeless youth, including services such as crisis intervention, counseling, and job training. The Act also authorized funding for the Street Outreach Program to provide support for homeless youth living on the streets or in areas that increase their risk of using drugs or being subjected to sexual abuse, prostitution, and trafficking. The Act was amended in 2002 to include funding for the Street Outreach Program, and in 2008 to include funding for the Street Outreach Program Data Collection Project. The Act was renewed in 2010 and 2016, and in 2018, Congress approved a new appropriation for the program. The Act has been amended several times to expand its scope and funding. The Act has been criticized for its lack of funding and inadequate services, but it remains a vital source of support for many runaways and homeless youth.\n\nPassage 8:\nThe Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA) is a federal workers' compensation program that provides benefits to workers engaged in longshore, harbor, or other maritime occupations on or adjacent to the navigable waters of the United States.
