{"pred": " Passage 1\nAbstract Gender inequality and sexist behaviour are prevalent in workplaces and online environments. Despite research on sexist behaviour, little is known about what triggers this behaviour and the individuals that initiate it. This study explores the evolutionary perspective on sexist behaviour, considering intrasexual competition as a key factor. The study examines how individual performance and social standing affect female-directed male behaviour in an online first-person shooter video game. The results suggest that low-status males that have the most to lose due to a hierarchical reconfiguration are responding to the threat female competitors pose, while high-status males with the least to fear are more positive towards female players. The study provides the clearest picture of inter-sexual competition to date, highlighting the importance of considering an evolutionary perspective when exploring the factors that affect male hostility towards women.\n\nKey evidence: The study found that skill determined the frequency of positive and negative statements towards a female-voiced teammate, and poorer performance resulted in more negative statements. The study also found that lower-skilled poorer-performing males were more hostile towards females, and higher-skilled males were more positive towards females.\n\nSummary: Passage 2\nA recent study found that men who are good at video games tend to be nicer to other players, especially women. The study, which analyzed 163 plays of the video game Halo 3, found that male players who were good at the game also tended to pay compliments to other male and female players. However, male players who were less-skilled at the game and performing worse relative their peers made frequent, nasty comments to female gamers. The study suggests that the better a player gets, the more likely they are to be nice to ladies. The researchers argue that this is because the better player is more confident and less threatened by the presence of female players. The study also found that men always treat each other about the same, regardless of their skill level or performance. The researchers suggest that this is because men often rely on aggression to maintain their dominant social status. The study's findings have implications for understanding online harassment and sexism, and may provide a new perspective on how to address these issues.", "answers": ["Like low-status Neanderthals, contemporary men who aren't exactly winners—literally, when it comes to playing video games—are more likely to harass women online, new research cited in the Washington Post finds. Scientists who conducted the study published in Plos One played 163 games of Halo as either male-voiced players or female-voiced players (82 female, 81 male) with remote teammates and opponents. The study gauged a remote player's skill by measuring such factors like kills and deaths. Researchers found men were typically cordial to players they believed to be male, and that more skilled men who kicked first-shooter butt were less likely to direct negative comments toward female-voiced players than their less skilled male counterparts. But lamer players tended to take their frustrations out on female players with more frequent, caustic comments. A lead author notes that gaming provides the perfect breeding ground for this kind of behavior: After all, the Post notes, players can remain anonymous, they may never run into an online teammate or opponent again, and it's a significantly male-biased recreation. Females threaten gamers' \"pre-existing social hierarchy\"; the guys at the bottom of the virtual totem pole feel threatened and therefore become more threatening to those they think they can quash the easiest. \"As men often rely on aggression to maintain their dominant social status, the increase in hostility towards a woman by lower-status males may be an attempt to disregard a female's performance and suppress her disturbance on the hierarchy to retain their social rank,\" the study notes. Such gamer communities mirror male-dominated industries—such as engineering or the tech field—and may promote sexist actions in real life, scientists warn."], "length": 6174}
{"pred": " Passage 1\nHillary Clinton's decision to sign a voter ID law into law has been met with legal challenges in federal court questioning its constitutionality. The law requires voters to produce a photo ID when they go to the polls, and it has been criticized for reducing the early-voting period by a week, abolishing same-day voter registration, and ending straight-party voting. The law brings sweeping changes to the state's election process, but it has been met with resistance from Democrats and civil rights groups who argue that it is discriminatory and will disproportionately affect African-American voters. The passage notes that the law is one of 34 states with some form of voter ID law, and that it is part of a broader trend of voter suppression efforts in the United States.\n\nSummary: Passage 2\nHillary Clinton has announced that she is considering a second presidential run, and has taken steps to prepare for the possibility. In a speech at the American Bar Association, Clinton emphasized the importance of voting rights and the need for the Democratic Party to take a stronger stance on issues related to voting.

That man, who was never caught, is suspected of having committed about three dozen crimes in the LA area. Vargas had matched assailant descriptions, and he caught investigators' eye because he had a faded teardrop tattoo under his left eye and a 1992 rape conviction involving his girlfriend at the time, reports the Los Angeles Times. \"You can sentence me to all the years you want, but ... that individual that really did these crimes might really be raping someone out there,\" Vargas warned a judge before he was sentenced in 1999. In 2012, Vargas reached out to the California Innocence Project and asked to use DNA techniques to examine samples on the clothing of one of his alleged victims, per the Times. The DNA matched that of the victim and the Teardrop Rapist. The three victims had positively IDed Vargas as the perpetrator, but an Innocence Project attorney tells the AP it was a \"shaky witness\" case, an assertion the LA district attorney's office backed up in a recent court letter that said there were discrepancies and uncertainties in their identification of the rapist, the Times notes.

Trump responded by labeling Corker a \"liddle\" and a \"fool,\" and the two have been exchanging insults ever since. Corker has also criticized Trump's economic policies, including his support for a flat tax and attacks on Social Security and Medicare. Trump has responded by calling Corker a \"fucking moron\" and saying that he is \"on the path to World War III.\"\n\nPassage 3:\nThe passage examines the motivations behind Corker's sudden change of heart and his decision to go public with his criticisms of Trump. Corker's campaign-era praise for Trump's foreign policy thinking has been criticized by other Republicans, who have accused him of being too soft on Trump.

Developments: Audio, transcript: The Times released excerpts from the interview, as well as audio here. It's not clear what Trump meant in saying that the newspaper set up Corker, but the transcript makes clear that Corker knew he was on the record, notes CNN. He also knew the call was being recorded, telling the reporter that his staff was recording it, \"and I hope you are, too.\" GOP trouble: At the National Journal, political analyst Charlie Cook of the Cook Political Report writes that Trump went to a \"darker place\" in his Corker criticism, and he now thinks the GOP majority is in jeopardy not only in the Senate but in the House. \"The party needs to sublimate its divisions, get mainstream Republicans to the polls, and persuade the Trump base to cast ballot for non-Trump Republicans,\" he writes. \"That's a tall order.

The essay explains that Smith was ordered to take multiple wives by an angel who visited him three times between 1834 and 1842; in the last instance, the angel was armed with a sword and threatened a reluctant Smith. The leader, then married to first wife Emma, took his first plural wife, Fanny Alger, in Kirtland, Ohio. Smith and Alger ultimately separated, and the church relocated to Nauvoo, Ill., where he married many more women.

{"pred": " \nPassage 1:\nSusan Rice, former National Security Adviser under President Barack Obama, requested the identities of U.S. persons in raw intelligence reports on dozens of occasions that connect to the Donald Trump transition and campaign. The pattern of Rice's requests was discovered in a National Security Council review of the government's policy on \"unmasking\" the identities of individuals in the U.S. who are not targets of electronic eavesdropping, but whose communications are collected incidentally. Normally those names are redacted from summaries of monitored conversations and appear in reports as something like \"U.S. Person One.\" Nunes Says Trump Team Caught in U.S. Surveillance Net. The National Security Council's senior director for intelligence, Ezra Cohen-Watnick, was conducting the review, according to two U.S. officials who spoke with Bloomberg View on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly. In February Cohen-Watnick discovered Rice's multiple requests to unmask U.S. persons in intelligence reports that related to Trump transition activities. He brought this to the attention of the White House General Counsel's office, who reviewed more of Rice's requests and instructed him to end his own research into the unmasking policy. The intelligence reports were summaries of monitored conversations -- primarily between foreign officials discussing the Trump transition, but also in some cases direct contact between members of the Trump team and monitored foreign officials. One U.S. official familiar with the reports said they contained valuable political information on the Trump transition such as whom the Trump team was meeting, the views of Trump associates on foreign policy matters and plans for the incoming administration. Rice did not respond to an email seeking comment on Monday morning. Her role in requesting the identities of Trump transition officials adds an important element to the dueling investigations surrounding the Trump White House since the president's inauguration. Both the House and Senate intelligence committees are probing any ties between Trump associates and a Russian influence operation against Hillary Clinton during the election. The chairman of the House intelligence committee, Representative Devin Nunes, is also investigating how the Obama White House kept tabs on the Trump transition after the election through unmasking the names of Trump associates incidentally collected in government eavesdropping of foreign officials. Rice herself has not spoken directly on the issue of unmasking. Last month when she was asked on the \"PBS NewsHour\" about reports that Trump transition officials, including Trump himself, were swept up in incidental intelligence collection, Rice said: \"I know nothing about this,\" adding, \"I was surprised to see", "answers": ["Former Obama national security adviser Susan Rice is back in the news again, this time regarding President Trump's wiretapping allegations. On the right, she is being accused of abusing her power while in office to \"unmask,\" for political advantage, the names of Trump associates caught up in intelligence surveillance. Trump critics, meanwhile, say the story doesn't amount to much and accuse the White House of trying to divert attention from the president's wiretapping allegations. A look at coverage: A key story comes from Eli Lake at Bloomberg News. He reported Monday that Rice requested the identities of Trump transition officials who were mentioned, but not named, in US intelligence reports. Those reports were mostly summaries of monitored conversations between foreign officials talking about the Trump transition, but sometimes between Trump associates and foreign officials. (The National Security Council logs of Rice's requests are apparently what Rep. Devin Nunes went to the White House to view.) Lake's piece raises questions about why Rice wanted those names revealed—she didn't respond to the story—but he also notes that her requests \"were likely within the law.\" He adds that the story doesn't \"vindicate\" Trump's unsupported accusation that Obama wiretapped Trump Tower. Adam Housley of Fox News also reported on Rice's requests, and his appearance on the network prompted Trump himself to weigh in via tweet: \"Such amazing reporting on unmasking and the crooked scheme against us by @foxandfriends. 'Spied on before nomination.' The real story.\" A post at Slate notes that Trump associates are under FBI investigation over allegedly improper communications with Russians, \"so there may well have been urgent, legal reasons for Rice to have wanted information about the relationships between specific Trump-related figures and foreign individuals.\" But the editorial page at the Wall Street Journal accuses the media and Democrats of hypocrisy. It wants any Trump-Russia ties investigated, but complains that the \"media have been running like wildebeest after that story while ignoring how the Obama Administration might have abused domestic surveillance for its political purposes. Americans deserve to know the truth about both.\" On CNN, Don Lemon accused the \"right-wing media\" of helping the White House try to divert attention from the controversy over Trump's wiretapping claims, adding that his show will not \"aid and abet people who are trying to misinform you, the American people, by creating a diversion,\" he said, per Mediaite. The conservative NewsBusters blog accused ABC, NBC, and CBS of covering up the story by failing to report on the \"massive revelation\" Monday in their evening broadcasts. On MSNBC Tuesday morning, frequent Trump critic Joe Scarborough blasted the New York Times for not having the story on its front page. \"What is Susan Rice unmasking names for and spreading them across the government,\" he asked on Morning Joe, per Mediaite. But the Times story on the subject (inside the paper) generally downplayed the significance of Rice's requests: \"Former national security officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, described the requests as normal and said they were justified by the need for the president’s top security adviser to understand the context of reports sent to her by the nation’s intelligence agencies.\""], "length": 6943}

The rover has been exploring Gale Crater, which is believed to have been habitable billions of years ago. The rover has found evidence of an ancient Martian lake that could have supported life as we know it for long stretches. The lake likely existed about 3.7 billion years ago, and its existence suggests that habitable environments were present on Mars more recently than previously thought. The rover's findings have made the possibility of Martian life significantly more plausible. The lake's existence is supported by evidence of ancient microbial life, which could have existed in the lake's calm waters. The rover's discoveries have also made the search for Martian carbon-based organic compounds more complicated and trying. The search for these compounds has been complicated by the presence of a chlorine-based compound that, when heated in the rover's Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) oven, largely destroys the compounds.

The rover's discoveries have also made the search for Martian life more plausible, suggesting that the Red Planet may have been habitable for millions of years.

This Planet 9, as the two Caltech researchers call it, hasn't been spotted yet. They base their findings on mathematical and computer modeling, and anticipate its discovery via telescope within five years. The two reported on their research Wednesday in the Astronomical Journal. Once it's detected, the researchers insist there will be no Pluto-style planetary debate. They ought to know; one of them, Mike Brown, is the so-called Pluto killer.\n\nKey evidence: Mathematical and computer modeling, detection via telescope within five years.\n\nUnique points: The researchers' findings are based on the motion of recently discovered dwarf planets and other small objects in the outer solar system, and they have not observed the planet directly.\n\nPassage 2:\nMike Brown stands for a portrait in front of an artist portrayal of Planet Nine. (Photo by Patrick T. Fallon for The Washington Post) Mike Brown is an astronomer at Caltech who's been instrumental in the discovery of more than 30 dwarf planets and asteroids at the far reaches of our solar system. Most members of the general public probably don't know about all of the planetoids he has found — but many know about the one planet he has killed. When Brown and his team discovered Eris, a dwarf planet more massive than Pluto, it was initially referred to as our solar system's 10th planet. But that ended in 2006 when the International Astronomical Union voted to define \"planet\" officially for the first time. Eris was out of the running, and Pluto was a casualty — cut from the official planetary roll call. Now Brown and his co-author, Konstantin Batygin, believe they've compiled the best evidence for a true ninth planet to take Pluto's place in the history books. We called Brown up to chat about the latest blow he has dealt to Pluto fans.\n\nKey evidence: The motion of recently discovered dwarf planets and other small objects in the outer solar system, mathematical and computer modeling.\n\nUnique points: The researchers' findings are based on the motion of recently discovered dwarf planets and other small objects in the outer solar system, and they have not observed the planet directly.\n\nPassage 3:\n", "answers": ["Pluto is gonna be PO'd.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal. Now they're simply hoping more astronomers join in to actually try to spot the alleged planet—and they're not concerned it will face Pluto's fate. \"That's not even a question—it's definitely a planet,\" Brown says.

{"pred": " Pacific Fishery Management Council's efforts to maintain a healthy Pacific Ocean are threatened by the decline of sardine populations, which are crucial for the marine ecosystem. The decline is caused by a combination of factors, including a naturally occurring climate cycle and overfishing. The sardine population has fluctuated naturally in the past, but the current decline is the steepest since the collapse of the sardine fishery in the mid-20th century. The decline has raised alarm among scientists, who warn that the West Coast's marine mammals, seabirds, and fishermen could suffer for years if the population does not recover. The Pacific sardine is a quintessential boom-bust fish, with its numbers being wildly unpredictable and short-lived. The decline has also led to a shortage of prey for ocean predators, including sea lions, which are starving without sardines. The decline of sardines is a complex problem that requires a comprehensive approach to address the various factors contributing to the decline. The Pacific Fishery Management Council should consider setting conservative catch limits on sardines, fulfilling its commitment to prohibit unregulated fishing on forage fish species, and causing for concern the potential consequences of the decline on the marine ecosystem.", "answers": ["The West Coast sardine population was down 72% since 2006 per a fall assessment—the worst crash since the mid-20th century, and one with far-reaching implications, particularly since the steep decline is expected to continue. One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing.

The report, which is said to be a searing indictment of the program, is based on information found in official documents and provided by people with knowledge of the dispute being fought in the seventh-floor executive offices of the CIA's headquarters in Langley, Va. The CIA has disputed some of the reports findings, and the White House has closely tracked the bitter struggle. The report details how the CIA misled the Bush administration and Congress about the use of interrogation techniques that many experts consider torture, and how the techniques didn't provide the intelligence that led the CIA to the hideout in Pakistan where Osama bin Laden was killed in a 2011 raid by Navy SEALs. The committee has determined earlier this year that the CIA monitored computers in possible violation of an agreement against doing so, and that provisions of the Federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act apply to the CIA's authorities. The CIA has taken unprecedented action against the committee in relation to the internal CIA review and has resisted surrendering top-secret documents that the CIA asserted were covered by executive privilege and sent to the White House. The White House has made clear to the chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that a summary of the findings and conclusions of the final report should be declassified, with any appropriate redactions necessary to protect national security. The conflict over the committee's investigation has heightened late last year when the committee discovered that a CIA internal review confirming some of the committee's findings had been withheld from Senate investigators.

The White House has also resisted surrendering the document, and the CIA has refused to cooperate with the committee's investigation. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has led a handful of lawmakers in pressing for the release of the report's conclusions, which committee members have publicly said show that the CIA misled the Bush administration and Congress about the intelligence gained from using water-boarding and other interrogation techniques. The conflict over the committee's investigation has highlighted the challenges of government oversight and the need for greater transparency and accountability in the executive branch.

{"pred": " Passage 2\nThe Santa Maria was the flagship of Christopher Columbus's three-vessel fleet which discovered the New World. The fleet first reached the Americas on 12 October 1492 when they sighted the Bahamas. 75 days later, at around midnight, while Columbus was asleep, the Santa Maria drifted onto a reef and could not be refloated. Within a few hours the ship's seams began to open – and the interior of the vessel was flooded. Christopher Columbus hired the ship in 1492 and sailed in it from southern Spain's Atlantic coast in search of a new western route to Asia (Rex). However, Columbus and his crew were made welcome by a local Taino chieftain. Columbus then established a fort, left a garrison of 39 men there, and returned to report his discoveries to the King and Queen of Spain. Later in 1493, he returned to his fort in Haiti – but it had been destroyed and the garrison had all died or been killed. The wreck of the Santa Maria was never found. The Unesco experts say that the evidence collected concerning the location, nature and artifact content of the site has been \"subjected to thorough investigation by an acclaimed team of experts\". The Unesco report may also have implications for the US public's perception of the organisation; America's relationship with Unesco is currently very poor. The United States has refused to pay its set financial contribution to Unesco for the past three years – and last year the organisation stripped America of its Unesco voting rights. The Santa Maria saga could potentially further damage relations, or at least public attitudes, because a senior US underwater archaeologist, Professor Charles Beeker of Indiana University, has been refused permission to continue his work. What was in effect a US-led investigation has been more or less killed off by Unesco, and replaced by a partly European team. Unesco has officially advised the Haitian government against accepting the US archaeological team's proposal because \"in its current state\" it \"lacked many elements required for the appropriate underwater archaeological research on the concerned site\", and because it \"did not conform\" to the organisation's standards on the protection of underwater cultural heritage.

UNESCO says the wreck is further from shore than accounts of Columbus' first voyage, and bronze or copper fasteners found at the site are evidence of shipbuilding techniques that date the ship to the late 17th or 18th century at the earliest.

The idea was met with skepticism, but Hyperloop Transportation Technologies (HTT) has licensed passive magnetic levitation technology to power its prototype system, which promises to shuttle humans and goods in a vacuum tube system at speeds up to 750 mph. The company plans to show off its prototype in the desert north of Las Vegas this week. The announcement comes just two days before rival Hyperloop Technologies Inc. plans to showcase the evolution of its technology to investors and media in the desert north of Las Vegas. Hyperloop Transportation Technologies has announced that it will use a passive magnetic levitation system developed by Lawrence Livermore National Labs in the US. The system involves firing a pod full of people through a low-pressure tube at speeds of up to 760 mph. The same thrust force is simply reversed to decelerate the pod. As the pod slows down, the system's battery is recharged through what Hyperloop describes as regenerative breaking. The Hyperloop Pod Competition sponsored by Elon Musk and SpaceX requires teams to construct pods that go at least 240 miles per hour. The competition has a goal of raising $66,000 to finish building their prototype pod. Hyperloop One, a startup that jumped at the challenge, tested its propulsion mechanism today. The test focused on more than just the propulsion technology, but also on the speed-by, which is the first step in a long journey. The electromagnet-based propulsion system is just one small part of the full transportation system that Hyperloop One hopes to launch in the not-too-distant future. The company plans to build a 5-mile prototype in Quay Valley, a planned community on virgin soil by sometime this year. The test was successful, but the sled took off from the start position and whizzed by on a track at a measured 2.4 Gs of acceleration. Future tests on this track at the 39.9 acre facility will go much, much faster.

The sardine fishery has been plagued by a severe population decline, with the population dropping 72% since its last peak in 2006. The decline is attributed to a combination of factors, including a naturally occurring climate cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and overfishing. The Pacific Fishery Management Council should set conservative catch limits on sardines when the population is so low and fulfill its commitment to prohibit unregulated fishing on forage fish species. The decline of sardine populations is having a ripple effect throughout the ecosystem, starving brown pelicans, sea lions, and other predators that rely on the oily, energy-rich fish for food. The decline is also having a significant impact on the commercial fishing industry, with the population projected to keep sliding.

One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing.

According to BuzzFeed, Martinez's mom said her daughter had gone to the area to work on a marijuana farm and she hadn't heard from her in a week. The Sheriff's Office was unable to find Martinez or contact anyone who might know her, so Martinez was added to the California Department of Justice's list of missing people. That list was the basis for a story in the North Coast Journal about the high number of missing people in Humboldt County. The newspaper shared the story Thursday on Facebook and asked readers if they recognized any of the missing people. Amy O'Brien did. \"I was like wait a minute, she looks so familiar,\" O'Brien tells the Chronicle. \"I instantly thought of The Bachelor.\" The Journal informed the sheriff's office, which contacted Martinez and removed her from the list. \"MOM. how many times do I have to tell you I don’t get cell service on The Bachelor??,\" Martinez tweeted after learning she was a missing person.

Sharon's vision of peace was under attack from all sides, including those in Israel who insisted on a larger state, Arab leaders who denied Israel the right to exist altogether, and non-state terrorist groups.

And this is only her most recent travail: Suh and two other women interviewed by the Post were trying to flee their lives as sex \"video chatters\" in China, an online profession many women are sucked into after first escaping North Korea—either by willingly getting sold to Chinese men to get out of their home country, or after being tricked into thinking they were being hired for jobs in China, only to end up as human trafficking victims. Purchasing North Korean women is big business in China for men who can't find wives any other way: The asking price for women between 15 and 25 can near $12,000. Life in China is impoverished and dangerous for these North Korean nationals: They can be deported back to their home country if they're caught, per Radio Free Asia. North Korean women trying to survive there often fall into the online \"video chatting\" business, allowing them to bring in some extra cash from the safety of their own homes. But it's a demeaning, demoralizing trade. \"I felt so disgusting,\" Suh says.

The chain tells The Associated Press it will launch its \"Croissant Donut\" nationally for a limited time starting Nov. 3, 2014. It comes more than a year after the Dominique Ansel Bakery in New York City introduced its now trademarked Cronut, which became a viral sensation and spawned numerous knockoffs. Last summer, Dunkin' also introduced a croissant-doughnut in South Korea it dubbed a \"New York Pie Donut.\" John Costello, Dunkin's president of global marketing and innovation, said in a phone interview that bakers around the country have been mixing doughnuts and croissants for at least 20 years. He said Dunkin' is constantly tracking consumer and bakery trends and has been looking at pastry \"combinations\" for several years now. The Croissant Donut is one of several new offerings Dunkin' has in the pipeline after reporting disappointing quarterly sales last week and warning it might struggle to make its long-term growth targets this year. Among the challenges the company is facing is increased competition, with chains including Taco Bell going after the breakfast crowd. Dunkin', based in Canton, Massachusetts, has nevertheless been opening new U.S. locations and last week said it sees potential for more than 17,000 U.S. locations over time, up from its current 8,000.

That's less than the $5 for a Cronut, but more than twice the $1 or so for other Dunkin' doughnuts, making it more profitable for the company.

The legislation, which is President François Hollande's first major social reform and a key election pledge, was backed by 329 deputies and opposed by 229. The bill redefines marriage as a contract between two people rather than between a man and a woman. Once passed, the reform will see France join 11 other gay-marriage friendly countries including Spain, Sweden, South Africa and the Netherlands. Nine US states and Washington DC have also legalised same-sex marriage and British lawmakers have recently voted for marriage equality in the UK. The move is France's biggest social reform since the abolition of the death penalty in 1981. The Catholic opposition has accused President Hollande of pushing through legislation without proper consultation. The debate sparked some of the country's largest protests in decades, with around 340,000 turning out in Paris on January 14 to protest the reform.

{"pred": " \nPassage 1:\nPeople can predict the IQ of men — but not women — by looking at their face, study finds. A man's facial characteristics contain some clues about his intelligence. The same can't be said for women's facial traits. The researchers found that people who were perceived as more attractive also tended to be perceived as more intelligent by both male and female participants. This link between perceived attractiveness and perceived intelligence was stronger for women's faces than men's faces. The researchers also found that the participants rated men with a high IQ as more intelligent based solely on their facial photograph. For women, however, the researchers found no statistically significant link between perceived intelligence and their actual IQ. The findings raised the question of why people could predict men's intelligence based on their face, but not predict women's intelligence based on their face. The researchers proposed a number of explanations to be tested by future research, including the idea that cues of higher intelligence are sexually dimorphic and are thus apparent only in men's faces, or that women are pervasively judged according to their attractiveness. The study suggests that a clear mental image of how a smart face should look does exist for both men and women within the community of human raters. The intelligence-stereotype shows the same transformations in facial shape space for both men and women. A narrower face with a thinner chin and a larger prolonged nose characterizes the predicted stereotype of high-intelligence, while a rather oval and broader face with a massive chin and a smallish nose characterizes the prediction of low-intelligence. The researchers found that people who were perceived as highly intelligent were more likely to be perceived as intelligent by both men and women, while those who were perceived as highly intelligent were also more likely to be perceived as intelligent by women. The study suggests that the perception of intelligence is not solely based on facial shape, but also on other visual cues. The researchers propose that the perception of intelligence is a complex process that involves multiple factors, including facial shape, attractiveness, and other visual cues. The study's findings have important implications for our understanding of human intelligence and social interaction.

Sources tell the Wall Street Journal that the document was prepared by Christopher Steele, a former Russia expert in Britain's spy service who founded the Orbis Business Intelligence research firm in 2009. The New York Times, in a look at how the dossier came to light, reports that Steele was hired by Washington research firm Fusion GPS, which was hired by a wealthy GOP donor in the fall of 2015 to compile anti-Trump material. After Trump became the presumptive nominee, the GOP donor no longer needed the research firm's services, but wealthy Democratic donors stepped in, and Steele continued to send monthly memos detailing alleged Russian efforts to both compromise Trump and assist his campaign, per the Times' sources. In other coverage: The Guardian looks at John McCain's involvement, which apparently included clandestine efforts to obtain the dossier after hearing about it from a diplomat during a conference in Canada. \"Upon examination of the contents, and unable to make a judgment about their accuracy, I delivered the information to the director of the FBI,\" McCain said in a statement Wednesday. The AP reports that it has been unable to contact Steele. A neighbor of the former spy, who lives outside London, says Steele and his family are away and it's not clear when they will return.

Early Thursday, Trump tweeted that Clapper had called him \"to denounce the false and fictitious report that was illegally circulated.\" He added: \"Made up, phony facts.Too bad!\" Politico looks at how Democrats are dealing with Trump's Russia troubles. So far, senators have been more restrained than House members, some of whom have started referring to Trump as \"Moscow Donald.\" The New York Times reports that Trump is facing a backlash from Jewish groups for wondering if we \"are living in Nazi Germany\" when he was criticizing intelligence agencies' handling of what he called \"fake news.\" At the Intercept, Glenn Greenwald calls the dossier \"farcical\" and warns that this episode could backfire badly for Democratic operatives and others treating the dossier as gospel. He warns that if it is proved false, it will \"forever discredit ... future journalistic exposés that are based on actual, corroborated wrongdoing.\""], "length": 6932}
