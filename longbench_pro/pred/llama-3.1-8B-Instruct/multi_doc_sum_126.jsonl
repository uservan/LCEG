Researchers have analyzed Ötzi's genome and found that he had a genetic predisposition to arteriosclerosis, a condition that is typically associated with modern risk factors such as obesity, lack of exercise, and smoking. Ötzi's teeth also show signs of severe gum disease and cavities, likely caused by his diet of coarse grain and use of his teeth as a \"third hand\" for gripping tools. The researchers also found that Ötzi had brown eyes, brown hair, type-O blood, and shared the lactose intolerance that was common among Neolithic Europeans. Additionally, Ötzi was the first known carrier of Lyme disease, which has plagued humans for thousands of years. The discovery of Ötzi's genome has provided new insights into the lives of ancient humans and their health conditions. The passage also discusses the rise of e-commerce and its impact on the market for counterfeit goods. U.S. agencies and international organizations have observed a shift in the sale of counterfeit goods from \"underground\" or secondary markets to primary markets, including e-commerce websites, corporate and government supply chains, and traditional retail stores. Counterfeiters have adopted new ways to deceive consumers, such as posting pictures of authentic goods on websites and posting pseudonymous reviews of their products or businesses.

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has primary oversight responsibility for the physical security and cybersecurity of transmission and distribution pipeline systems. TSA's Pipeline Security Branch conducts voluntary Corporate Security Reviews (CSRs) and Critical Facility Security Reviews (CFSRs) to assess pipeline vulnerabilities and industry implementation of TSA's Pipeline Security Guidelines. However, TSA's ability to conduct effective reviews is hindered by staffing limitations and a lack of a workforce plan.

In both humans and Parnell's mustached bats—a species that lives in an area ranging from Mexico to Brazil, RedOrbit reports—the left hemisphere handles quicker sounds, while the right deals with slower ones, a press release reports.

The researchers studied 3,432 UK university staff and students aged 18-40 who had been bereaved. The study also found that those bereaved by suicide were 80% more likely to drop out of education or work. The researchers suggest that addressing social stigma attached to suicide bereavement might be one way to help limit its impact on people's lives. The study highlights the profound impact that suicide might have on friends and family members, but notes that these outcomes are not inevitable. The researchers emphasize that people bereaved by suicide should not be made to feel responsible or stigmatized, and should be treated with the same compassion as those bereaved by other causes. The study also suggests that a history of suicide among non-blood relatives and friends should be considered when assessing suicide risk. The researchers found that people who had been bereaved by suicide tended to perceive more social stigma around the death, but when the results were adjusted for perceived social stigma, the significant differences in suicide attempts and occupational functioning disappeared. The study's findings have implications for how professionals assess and support individuals who have experienced a suicidal loss. The researchers emphasize the importance of asking about the impact of a suicidal loss and whether feeling stigmatized has prevented individuals from accessing help. The study's findings also highlight the need for further research into the impact of suicide bereavement on individuals and communities. The researchers suggest that addressing social stigma and providing support to individuals who have experienced a suicidal loss are critical steps in reducing the risk of suicide attempts and promoting mental health and well-being. The study's findings have important implications for policy and practice, and highlight the need for a more nuanced understanding of the impact of suicide bereavement on individuals and communities.

The Public Safety Officers' Benefits (PSOB) program provides cash benefits to federal, state, and local law enforcement officers, firefighters, and emergency medical services agencies who are killed or permanently and totally disabled in the line of duty. The PSOB program pays benefits if a public safety officer becomes permanently and totally disabled or dies \"as the direct and proximate result of a personal injury sustained in the line of duty.\" The PSOB regulation defines an injury for the purposes of benefit eligibility as a traumatic physical wound (or a traumatized physical condition of the body) directly and proximately caused by external force, chemicals, electricity, climatic conditions, infectious disease, radiation, virii, or bacteria. The PSOB program covers a public safety officer's death or disability if it occurred as the result of an injury incurred in the line of duty. The PSOB death benefit is payable to the eligible spouse and children of a public safety officer, with the benefit amount based on the date of the public safety officer's death or the date of the injury that caused the disability. The PSOB death benefit is not subject to the federal income tax and is paid in addition to any other workers' compensation, life insurance, or other benefits paid for the death of a public safety officer.

The Maximum Absorbency Garment system, donned by Gemini and Apollo astronauts, featured one very specific element: a sleeve likened to a condom with a hole at the tip that enabled the men to urinate into a pouch with a one-way valve in their suits. Three sleeve sizes were available, small, medium, and large. And astronauts couldn't fib, explains Rethke. If they decided to order the next size up, the sheath wouldn't fit snugly, and liquid could potentially leak out, causing damage. To make the process a little less embarrassing, the sizes were later renamed: large, gigantic, and humongous. Motherboard notes that the urination issue was first brought to the fore by Alan Shepard, who spent hours in the Freedom 7 capsule in advance of a quick 15-minute \"suborbital hop.\" Denied permission to leave the capsule, he opted to pee in his suit—forcing Mission Control to turn off his biomedical sensors until the flow of oxygen in the suit dried the pee, allowing the sensors to be switched on.

{"pred": " The recent terrorist attacks in New York and New Jersey have raised concerns about the effectiveness of the U.S. government's screening and vetting processes for non-immigrant visa (NIV) applicants. The attacks, which injured 29 people in Chelsea, New York, and caused a pipe bomb explosion in Seaside Park, New Jersey, have led to a renewed focus on the need for more robust screening and vetting procedures. The U.S. Department of State (State) is responsible for the adjudication of NIV applications, and manages the application process, including the consular officer corps and its functions at more than 220 visa-issuing posts overseas. The screening and vetting process for determining who will be issued or refused a visa contains several steps, including petitions, USCIS background checks, NIV application, and adjudication. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) conducts background checks on U.S.-based petitioners and foreign beneficiaries, and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) conducts recurrent vetting of NIV holders against emerging threat information. The total number of NIV applications that consular officers adjudicated annually peaked at about 13.4 million in fiscal year 2016, and the refusal rate for NIVs increased from about 14 percent in fiscal year 2012 to about 22 percent in fiscal year 2016. The refusal rate can fluctuate from year to year due to various factors, including changes in political and economic conditions in individual countries. The U.S. government has taken several steps to enhance NIV screening and vetting processes, including the development of uniform screening standards for U.S. immigration benefit programs. The National Vetting Center is being established to optimize the use of federal government information in support of the national vetting enterprise. The center will coordinate policy and set priorities, and will use the uniform baselines for screening and vetting standards and procedures established per EO-2 to set short- and long-term priorities to improve screening and vetting across the U.S. government. The U.S. government has also taken steps to implement new visa screening and vetting protocols and procedures, including the development of a new form, the DS-5535, which collects additional information from a subset of visa applicants to more rigorously evaluate applicants for visa ineligibilities. The U.S. government has also imposed visa entry restrictions on certain categories of foreign nationals from designated countries, including Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, Venezuela, and Yemen.", "answers": ["A bomb squad robot was destroyed and another had its arm blown off when one of five bombs found in a backpack near a New Jersey train station blew up early Monday.

The devices—which were discovered by two men who found the backpack on top of a garbage can outside a restaurant near the Elizabeth station—will be closely examined for evidence linking them to explosive devices found in New York City and elsewhere in New Jersey over the weekend.

Rick Snyder announced a new development Wednesday in Flint's water crisis that \"just adds to the disaster we are already facing\": specifically, a marked increase in cases of Legionnaires' disease that could be linked to the area's tainted water, reports the Detroit Free Press. From June 2014 to November 2015, there were 87 cases in Genesee County, 10 of them fatal, per the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. In the previous four years, Legionnaires' cases ran from six per year to 13, CNN notes. And while the MDHHS isn't able to definitively tie the spike to Flint's water, it's taking the news seriously, and a drinking water expert who's been studying Flint's water tells the Free Press there's a \"very strong likelihood\" that it played a role. MDHHS officials first observed the rise in Legionnaires' cases in the fall of 2014, per the Free Press, and researchers found the bacteria to blame was proliferating in larger buildings, many with older plumbing. \"Our hypothesis is that something about the Flint River and lack of corrosion control, plus big buildings, is creating these problems,\" Marc Edwards, head of an independent Virginia team looking into the crisis, tells the Free Press. Speaking Wednesday, Snyder said he learned of the issue just \"a few days ago\" and appeared to place some blame on the state's Department of Environmental Quality, the paper notes. \"We're taking every action within reason, and going beyond reason to address this,\" he said. State health officials say it's OK for residents to shower and bathe, though they still can't drink the water. Edwards' team agrees, though he laments how it's all been handled. \"It's a crisis of conscience in government,\" he tells CNN. \"There are just so many places where you wish people had done things differently.\""], "length": 107282}

Cheney Mason, a Florida lawyer, joined the defense team and worked pro bono, spending over a million dollars of his own money on the case. Mason described Anthony as quiet, afraid, and unsure, and said that she was a child herself. The prosecution presented a circumstantial case, and the jury ultimately acquitted Anthony of first-degree murder and other serious charges, convicting her of four misdemeanors of providing false information to law enforcement officers. Anthony now lives in an undisclosed location in Florida, where she works as a housekeeper and is constantly on guard due to public hate and threats. Mason and his wife, Shirley, have continued a relationship with Anthony, who still distrusts the outside world and is afraid of people. The case was a high-profile and emotionally charged trial that captivated the nation, and the verdict was met with widespread shock and outrage.

The disease has a high death rate, ranging from 23-90%, and symptoms include fever, chills, headache, and myalgia, followed by a maculopapular rash, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, sore throat, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. The disease is spread through direct contact with the blood, tissues, or bodily fluids of an infected person or an infected primate or fruit bat. The first outbreak of Marburg occurred in 1967 in Germany and Yugoslavia, and since then, there have been a dozen outbreaks, including a large-scale outbreak in 1998 that infected 154 people and killed 128. The disease is rare but can have a high death rate, and there is no cure or proven vaccine.

The airline Aeroflot told the AP he was booked on a Moscow-Havana flight this morning (the expectation being he'd then travel to Venezuela and then to Ecuador, where WikiLeaks says he will seek asylum), prompting a number of journalists to grab seats on said flight. But Snowden apparently never boarded, reports Business Insider via an article with this headline: \"Russia Just Punked a Bunch of Journalists Who Are Now On Their Way to Havana.\" AP Moscow correspondent Max Seddon confirmed that there was no sign of Snowden, tweeting, \"Cuba here we come. Taxiing down Sheremetevo runway and no sign of Snowden. Seats empty still by 17A.\" How did Snowden get out of Hong Kong yesterday to begin with? Despite the Chinese territory's autonomy, the final decision came from Beijing, sources tell the New York Times. The move lets China save face while avoiding a drawn-out extradition battle. Some legal experts are telling the New York Times the US government goofed in waiting until Saturday to revoke Snowden's passport, though charges were filed June 14. Says a former federal prosecutor, \"They missed an opportunity to freeze him in place.\" Still, the Times notes that Snowden may have still been able to fly to Moscow sans passport thanks to special refugee travel documents from Ecuador that WikiLeaks helped Snowden obtain."], "length": 110466}

The phone also has a secure folder where users can store private files and apps, protected by the iris scanner. The iris scanner is a new feature that uses a special front-facing camera array to scan the user's eyes and unlock the phone. However, it is clumsier to use than the fingerprint scanner. The Note 7 also has a 12-megapixel camera, which is excellent for low-light shots and focuses quickly. The camera app has been cleaned up, with a simpler interface that relies on gestures for switching between front and rear cameras and changing modes. The phone also has a refined version of Samsung's software interface on top of Android 6.0 Marshmallow, with new features such as a nighttime display mode and an improved always-on display feature. However, the phone is still loaded with carrier bloatware and duplicative apps, which can be annoying. The Note 7 is a great phone, but it has some drawbacks, such as the clumsiness of the iris scanner and the bloatware. Despite this, it is still a great option for those who want a big phone with a lot of features.

The FBI says the other four devices found will be encased in blastproof material and taken to the agency's headquarters for further investigation, the New York Times reports. The devices—which were discovered by two men who found the backpack on top of a garbage can outside a restaurant near the Elizabeth station—will be closely examined for evidence linking them to explosive devices found in New York City and elsewhere in New Jersey over the weekend. A round-up of coverage: Elizabeth Mayor Christian Bollwage says the two men thought the backpack held something of value and carried it some distance before realizing it held explosive devices and calling police, NJ.com. He says in its original location near a pub, the devices could have caused carnage. \"If that pub was crowded and there was a lot of people there, it could have severely injured, killed and maimed many, many people,\" the mayor says. The AP reports that thousands of Amtrak and NJ Transit passengers were affected by the discovery of the device, with some stuck on trains for hours. Service has resumed but passengers in the area have been warned that they can expect delays Monday. NBC New York reports that investigators believe surveillance video shows the same man at two locations where explosive devices were found in Manhattan. Police aren't sure whether there is a link between the New York devices and those found in New Jersey. CNN reports that there is now an increased security presence in New York City not just because of the bombs, but because world leaders are gathering for the United Nations General Assembly.

Andrew Cuomo calls \"obviously an act of terrorism\"—and the device that exploded before a New Jersey race to benefit Marines and sailors early Saturday. It's not clear whether a trigger was found with the Elizabeth devices. Bollwage says he's not sure his city was targeted.

He used his connections within the world of professional sports to bolster his organization and was accused of coordinating the sale of five grams of cocaine and 15 capsules of ecstasy to a professional football player in 2014. Hanson's scheme was dismantled after he was arrested in 2015, and 21 other members of his crew were arrested on federal charges related to gambling and drug trafficking. Hanson's lawyer, Mark Adams, said that his client has no comment on the case. Hanson's downfall was attributed to his need to develop a more sinister self-image, building his empire through ruthless intimidation, paid beat downs, and baroque death threats. He was known for his flamboyant lifestyle, owning a sleek residence in Redondo Beach, California, with a lap pool, an ornate \"tequila room,\" and wall décor featuring a silver-plated AK-47 embossed with the Louis Vuitton logo. Hanson's scheme was uncovered after Robert Cipriani, a professional gambler, blew through $2.5 million of Hanson's money in a matter of days at the Star Casino in Sydney.

The money was to be returned with a casino check, though Cipriani could keep any winnings.

A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that 30% of outpatient oral antibiotic prescriptions are unnecessary, with 13% of all outpatient office visits resulting in an antibiotic prescription. The study also found that 44% of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions are written to treat patients with acute respiratory conditions, such as sinus infections, middle ear infections, and bronchitis. The White House has set a goal to reduce inappropriate outpatient antibiotic use by 50% by 2020, which would require a 15% reduction in overall antibiotic use. The misuse of antibiotics contributes to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which can lead to serious health consequences, including 2 million infections and 23,000 deaths annually in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has warned that the overuse of antibiotics is a major public health threat, and that the consequences of inaction will be severe. The CDC has also emphasized the importance of proper antibiotic use, including only prescribing antibiotics when necessary and using the correct dosage and duration. The misuse of antibiotics is not only a public health issue but also an economic burden, with the cost of treating antibiotic-resistant infections estimated to be over $20 billion annually. The study's findings highlight the need for improved antibiotic stewardship and the importance of educating healthcare providers and patients about the proper use of antibiotics. The study also suggests that the misuse of antibiotics is often driven by pressure from patients or parents, and that healthcare providers may be influenced by patient satisfaction and the desire to please patients. The study's authors recommend that healthcare providers and patients work together to improve antibiotic use and that pharmacists play a key role in educating patients about the proper use of antibiotics. The study's findings have important implications for public health policy and practice, and highlight the need for a coordinated effort to address the misuse of antibiotics. The misuse of antibiotics is a complex issue that requires a multifaceted approach, including education, policy changes, and improved prescribing practices.

And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts—the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post—isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them. The Times notes President Obama's initiative to cut down on unnecessary outpatient antibiotic use by 50% by 2020; researchers say that, based on this study, we'll need to slash overall antibiotic use by 15% to meet that. \"If we continue down the road of inappropriate use we'll lose the most powerful tool we have to fight life-threatening infections,\" CDC Director Tom Frieden says. \"Losing these antibiotics would undermine our ability to treat patients with deadly infections [and] cancer, provide organ transplants, and save victims of burns and trauma.\" (Here's hoping teixobactin can help us out with superbugs.)"], "length": 109795}

Roof had a history of racist views and had been banned from a local mall after making threatening comments. The shooting was seen as a hate crime, and the community came together to mourn the victims and demand justice. The incident highlighted the ongoing issue of racial tensions in the US and the need for greater understanding and empathy. The US government has taken steps to address the issue of racial violence, including the creation of the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights, which investigates complaints of racial discrimination in education. The Office of Inspector General (OIG) has also been established to investigate allegations of misconduct by federal agencies.

The political geography also favors Democrats, with none of the 10 seats Democrats are defending in states that were won by either John McCain or Mitt Romney in 2008 or 2012. Republicans are defending a lot of turf that's either blue or purple, which could make it harder for them to hold onto their seats.

In the past few weeks, Democrats have seen their fortunes fall as the presidential race has tightened. The FiveThirtyEight Senate forecast has 11 seats to watch, ranging from most likely to go Democratic to least likely. The most likely Democratic pickup is Illinois, where Republican Sen.

This is because these males rely on aggression to maintain their dominant social status, and the presence of females disrupts this status hierarchy. The study used a video game to examine the behavior of male players towards female players, and found that lower-skilled males were more hostile towards female players, especially when performing poorly. In contrast, higher-skilled males were more positive towards female players. The study suggests that this behavior is an attempt to disregard the performance and suppress the disturbance of female competitors, and that higher-skilled males are more likely to be supportive and even flirtatious towards female players.

Forensic experts who examined the results of DNA tests obtained by the Daily Camera and 9NEWS disputed former District Attorney Mary Lacy's conclusion that the DNA profile referred to as Unknown Male 1 was the killer's. The experts suggested that the DNA samples recovered from the long johns came from at least two people in addition to JonBenet, and that the original DNA sample recovered from JonBenet's underwear could be a composite and not that of a single individual. The presence of a third person's genetic markers has never been publicly revealed. The experts also raised the possibility that the DNA on JonBenet's undergarments could have been transferred from another piece of clothing, which would contradict the assertions that DNA will be key to finding JonBenet's killer.

The experts consulted by the news organizations disagreed with Lacy's assertions that the DNA evidence proved the killer's identity and that there was no innocent explanation for the DNA's presence on JonBenet's clothing. The DNA profile referred to as Unknown Male 1 may not be the DNA of a single person at all, but a composite of genetic material from multiple individuals.

At the time, Lacy concluded that DNA evidence found on JonBenet's underwear and long johns belonged to a male intruder who was not part of the Ramsey family. But now three forensic experts who examined the DNA test results and lab reports used by Lacy say they do not support her conclusion.

He also knew the call was being recorded, telling the reporter that his staff was recording it, \"and I hope you are, too.\" GOP trouble: At the National Journal, political analyst Charlie Cook of the Cook Political Report writes that Trump went to a \"darker place\" in his Corker criticism, and he now thinks the GOP majority is in jeopardy not only in the Senate but in the House. \"The party needs to sublimate its divisions, get mainstream Republicans to the polls, and persuade the Trump base to cast ballot for non-Trump Republicans,\" he writes. \"That's a tall order. And it's why last week's news reduced the odds of the GOP retaining its majority from a good bet to even money.\" Ulterior motives? Pascal-Emmanuel Gobry of the Week calls Corker a hypocrite for his sudden public turn on the president and suggests that the retiring senator is positioning himself to be an \"establishment\" primary challenger to the president in the 2020 election. Now what? James Fallows at the Atlantic writes that if Corker truly believes Trump might blunder his way into World War III, he has an obligation to \"do something about it\" by providing a crucial check on Trump's actions through his position as chair of the Foreign Relations Committee. \"Talk is better than nothing, but action is what counts.\" WSJ weighs in: The conservative editorial page of the Wall Street Journal thinks Corker spoke the truth about the president's \"lack of discipline, short fuse, narcissism and habit of treating even foreign heads of state as if they are Rosie O'Donnell,\" and it hopes other top Republicans follow Corker's lead because it might actually help. Little reaction: NBC News rounds up reaction from top Republicans to Corker's statements about the president and finds \"silence or a shrug.\" A typical sentiment, from Marco Rubio: \"You'll have to ask Sen. Corker what led him to make that statement. I haven't made that statement.\" Trump's new criticism comes just a week before a Senate vote important to Trump's tax plan, notes the New York Times."], "length": 108821}
{"pred": " Astronomers have found evidence of a ninth planet in our solar system, which they call Planet 9. This planet is estimated to be 5-10 times the mass of Earth and is thought to be located in the outer solar system, beyond Neptune's orbit. The discovery was made by analyzing the motion of recently discovered dwarf planets and other small objects in the outer solar system. The researchers suggest that Planet 9 may have been flung into deep space long ago by the gravitational force of Jupiter or Saturn. The planet is thought to be about two to four times the diameter of Earth, making it the fifth-largest planet after Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. However, it would reflect so little sunlight that it could evade even the most powerful telescopes. The discovery of Planet 9 has sparked renewed interest in the possibility of a hidden planet in our solar system. Mike Brown, the astronomer who discovered the dwarf planet Eris, which led to Pluto's demotion, believes that the discovery of Planet 9 is a significant finding that could change our understanding of the solar system. Brown suggests that the discovery of Planet 9 could lead to a reevaluation of the definition of a planet, and potentially even the status of Pluto. The discovery of Planet 9 has also raised questions about the possibility of other hidden planets in the solar system. The researchers behind the discovery of Planet 9 are confident that their findings are correct, but acknowledge that further research is needed to confirm the existence of the planet. The discovery of Planet 9 has sparked a new era of exploration and discovery in the field of astronomy, and has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the solar system. The debate over Pluto's status as a planet has been ongoing since its demotion in 2006, with some arguing that it should be reinstated as a planet.

While the dwarf planet tries to fight its way back into the good graces of Those Who Deem What Counts as a Planet, another icy orb even further out may snatch that designation first. Astronomers at the California Institute of Technology say a giant celestial body \"lurking at the end of our solar system,\" as the Washington Post puts it, may actually be a planet, and they're even already calling it \"Planet Nine.\" In their research published in the Astronomical Journal, the sky-watching scientists—one of whom is known as the \"Pluto killer\" for his role in getting Pluto demoted—think their find is five to 10 times as massive as Earth, and per the AP, almost as big as Neptune and orbiting billions of miles past that planet's orbit. Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal. Now they're simply hoping more astronomers join in to actually try to spot the alleged planet—and they're not concerned it will face Pluto's fate. \"That's not even a question—it's definitely a planet,\" Brown says.

The spacecraft has traveled 3 billion miles from Earth and will collect data on Pluto's atmosphere, geology, and moons. The flyby is a historic moment in space exploration, marking the completion of the initial reconnaissance of the \"classical\" nine planets in our Solar System. The spacecraft will also investigate Pluto's five moons, including Charon, Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra. The flyby is expected to reveal new insights into Pluto's composition, size, and shape, and will provide a unique opportunity to study the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy bodies beyond Neptune. The New Horizons spacecraft is equipped with seven sophisticated instruments, including a high-resolution camera and a spectrometer, which will help scientists to better understand Pluto's composition and geology. The spacecraft will also carry a small container with the ashes of Clyde Tombaugh, the astronomer who discovered Pluto in 1930. The flyby is a significant milestone in the exploration of the outer Solar System and will provide valuable information for future space missions. The spacecraft will take scores of photographs as it speeds past Pluto and its moons, giving the first close-up view of the mountains and valleys of the unknown world. The images will also capture details up to 100 meters across, a vast improvement on those taken on approach, which pick out features about 15 kilometers across.

The confirmation will mark the completion of NASA's tour of the \"classical nine\" planets, reports the AP, which notes that Pluto was considered a full-fledged planet instead of a dwarf one when the probe began its journey in 2006. Some things to know about the historic flyby, which comes 50 years to the day after the first successful flyby of Mars: New Horizons will have to capture a vast amount of data in a short time. The probe will be pushed to its limits as it pivots to capture photos and information on Pluto and its moons Charon, Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra during the flyby. \"I can't wait to get into the data and really start making sense of it.

The probe is far too busy to \"phone home,\" the AP notes, but it's expected to send a confirmation signal at around 9pm tonight. The eagerly awaited first photos from the flyby should be released tomorrow night, the Guardian reports, though it will take 16 months to send all the data from the flyby back to Earth. We've already learned a lot of new things about Pluto. \"The science we've already made is mouth-watering,\" says Stern. \"The Pluto system is enchanting in its strangeness and its alien beauty.\" Among NASA's findings in recent days: Pluto's North Pole has an icy cap and the planet's diameter is 1,597 miles across, not 1,471 miles as previously thought. The finding suggests the planet contains a lot more ice and a lot less rock than thought, the Christian Science Monitor reports. There are still a lot of mysteries to be solved. Scientists hope the first close-up look at Pluto's surface will explain features like heart- and doughnut-shaped features recently spotted for the first time. LiveScience notes that new information from Pluto could help explain how our own planet formed and how life began. \"There's a feeling among scientists that Pluto probably will tell us what the early solar system looked like and it's now locked in deep freeze and maybe it will tell us what we once were, a long time ago,\" the director of the Deep Space Communication Complex tells Reuters. The Australian facility will be first to receive new information from the spacecraft. New Horizons isn't done.

Experts relay how casinos track and target addicted gamblers, supply ready flows of cash via on-site ATMs, and offer plenty of perks to keep them coming back. But it's the modern-day slot machines themselves, with deceptive technology called virtual reel mapping, that seem to be designed to lull gamblers into a trance—or what the industry refers to as \"continuous gaming productivity\"—so they don't stop playing.

Their joint investigation found an elevated death and complication count for heart transplant patients there, whose one-year survival rate \"now ranks near the bottom nationally\" at 85% for those who got a new heart between mid-2014 and 2016; the national rate was 91.4%.

But by March 23, he was dead, having never left the hospital. What happened in between is a series of missteps, starting with the Jan. 2 transplant. Two months after the transplant his family learned what went wrong that day: The defibrillator Dr. Masahiro Ono tried to use to \"jolt the new heart into rhythm\" wasn't working; he said he had to pump it by hand for 10 minutes until a working one was found. The donor heart was damaged and weakened as a result and wouldn't strengthen; it was eventually swapped for an artificial heart. Then came strokes, infection in Lewis' bloodstream, and what the family says was another equipment mishap that left him brain-dead. Read the full story here."], "length": 111838}

The article is a fascinating oral history of the show's beginning that includes interviews with Stewart, Carell, Stephen Colbert, and pretty much everyone involved. The first year was rough for Stewart as he fought with the holdover writing staff from previous host Craig Kilborn and sought to put his stamp on the show.

After a few seconds of awkward silence, Carell says, \"I was just kidding! I don’t even know what that means!\" And the tense moment subsides. (See the clip.)

The New York Times, in a look at how the dossier came to light, reports that Steele was hired by Washington research firm Fusion GPS, which was hired by a wealthy GOP donor in the fall of 2015 to compile anti-Trump material. After Trump became the presumptive nominee, the GOP donor no longer needed the research firm's services, but wealthy Democratic donors stepped in, and Steele continued to send monthly memos detailing alleged Russian efforts to both compromise Trump and assist his campaign, per the Times' sources.

Liposomes may be unilamellar vesicles (possessing a single bilayer membrane) or multilamellar vesicles (onion-like structures characterized by multiple membrane bilayers, each separated from the next by an aqueous layer). The bilayer is composed of two lipid monolayers having a hydrophobic “tail” region and a hydrophilic “head” region. Liposomes are used in drug delivery regimens, providing sustained release of drugs for extended periods. They can be taken up by certain cells, such as phagocytes, delivering their active ingredient to the interior of the cells. Liposomes behave like particles, and are commonly described in terms of average particle size and particle-size distributions. The size of liposomes is important for their effectiveness in vivo, as well as their stability and leakage resistance. Liposomes can be size-reduced using an extrusion process, which involves passing them through a filter with a pore size of 100 nm or less. This process avoids the problems of homogenization and sonication methods, and does not require multiple passes through decreasing size filters. Liposomes can be made from a variety of materials, including egg phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol. The size of liposomes can be controlled by extruding them through a filter with a specific pore size. Liposomes can be used to deliver a wide range of drugs, including those for cancer treatment and infectious diseases. Liposomes can be made to have a specific size and shape, allowing them to be targeted to specific cells or tissues.

In their findings published in the BMJ Open journal, researchers from University College London studied 3,432 adults ages 18 to 40 who'd been bereaved by a sudden death of a friend or family member. They found that individuals whose deceased loved ones had killed themselves were 65% more likely to attempt suicide themselves (what NDTV refers to as the phenomenon of \"suicide contagion\") than those affected by a loved one's sudden death by natural causes—or 1 in 10 people in that segment, per a press release. And having someone close to you die by suicide was found to have other repercussions, too: The study discovered that those affected by suicidal deaths were 80% more likely to leave a work or educational situation, per the release. \"Our results highlight the profound impact that suicide might have on friends and family members,\" study author Dr. Alexandra Pitman says in the release. And the social stigma around suicide may be a significant factor affecting a mourning person's outlook. \"Suicide in particular is often perceived as a taboo subject,\" Pitman notes. \"Avoiding the subject can make a bereaved person feel very isolated and stigmatized, and sometimes even blamed for the death.\" That's not to say, though, that having such a tragedy afflict a family member or close friend dooms a person to a similar sad fate. \"These outcomes are by no means inevitable,\" Pitman says. \"If you have been bereaved by suicide, you should know that are not alone and support is available.\" (A Marine unit has lost 14 members to suicide.)"], "length": 110023}

The New York Times published a report detailing extensive allegations of abuse and harassment by Weinstein, which led to his firing by the board of Weinstein Co. on October 8, 2017. Weinstein's contract was expiring, and the board had been considering terminating his employment due to his behavior. However, the board's inaction allowed Weinstein to remain in power for over a decade. The board's structure, which granted immense power to Weinstein and his brother Bob, also contributed to his ability to maintain control. The board's bylaws and operating agreement favored the Weinstein brothers, allowing them to control all decisions related to running the studio. The board's inaction was also influenced by the presence of powerful friends of Weinstein, including James Dolan, Dirk Ziff, and Paul Tudor Jones, who were more concerned with protecting their own interests than with holding Weinstein accountable. The board's failure to address Weinstein's behavior led to a culture of fear and intimidation, which prevented employees from speaking out against him.

{"pred": " The passages discuss the concept of hemispheric specialization in the human brain, specifically in relation to language and music processing. The Heisenberg-Gabor Limit is a mathematical principle that explains the trade-off between temporal and spectral resolution in sound processing. Research on mustached bats has shown that they use the left and right hemispheres of their brains to process different aspects of sounds, with the left hemisphere better at processing fast sounds and the right hemisphere better at processing slow sounds. This asymmetrical sound processing is sex-dependent, with males having more asymmetry than females. The study suggests that this asymmetry may be related to the bats' need to use fast timing to distinguish communication sounds from each other and slow timing to use sonar to track the velocity of fast-moving insects. The findings have implications for understanding human language disorders and potentially improving computer speech recognition. The study also highlights the importance of considering the time-frequency trade-off in sound processing and the need for more research on this topic. The mustached bat's brain is a unique model for studying sound processing and language disorders, and the study's findings may have implications for understanding the neural basis of language and music processing in humans.

In both humans and Parnell's mustached bats—a species that lives in an area ranging from Mexico to Brazil, RedOrbit reports—the left hemisphere handles quicker sounds, while the right deals with slower ones, a press release reports. For humans, the right hemisphere \"may allow us to identify who is speaking, to gauge their emotional state via tone of voice, and to tease out pitch in music,\" Washington notes. As for the left hemisphere, \"men largely use just the left hemisphere\" to process language, while women use both hemispheres to do so, Washington says. In mustached bats—named based on the hair springing from the sides of their snouts, Animal Diversity Web explains—the right hemisphere's slower processing is used for sonar, \"which relies on detecting small changes in frequency,\" says Washington, senior author of the study in Frontiers in Neuroscience.

The budget plan would eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The proposal would also cut funding for the National Institutes of Health by $5.8 billion, or close to 20 percent. Trump's budget plan would not take effect until the new fiscal year on October 1, but the president must still reach a separate agreement with Congress by the end of April.

The CIA and NSA director, Michael Morell, endorsed Hillary Clinton in the New York Times, claiming that Trump was an unwitting agent of the Russian Federation. The CIA and NSA director under George W. Bush, Gen. Michael Hayden, also endorsed Clinton, warning that Trump sounded like Vladimir Putin. Trump's defense of the intelligence community and his refusal to agree with their findings on Russian interference have been seen as a sign of his willingness to defy the intelligence community. The Democratic Party is renewing its push for an independent, bipartisan commission to probe Russia's meddling, following the revelation that Trump was briefed on Russia's alleged attempts to collect compromising information on him. The Anti-Defamation League and the Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect condemned Trump for trivializing the Holocaust to score a political point. Trump's analogy was seen as an inappropriate comparison and coarsening of the discourse. The Washington Post reported that the Democratic National Committee had been hacked, and a mysterious figure began publishing the stolen documents online. The former journalist and the former spy, Christopher Steele, were hired to investigate Trump's connections to Russia. Steele, a former British intelligence officer, wrote up his findings in a series of memos, which he delivered to Fusion GPS. The memos described two different Russian operations, including one that used \"kompromat\" to gather compromising material on Trump. The goal was to make Trump a source who might provide information to friendly Russian contacts. Trump has said he has no major properties in Russia, but one of his sons said that \"a lot of money\" was pouring in from Russia. The Democratic Party is struggling with how to respond to Trump's Russia troubles, with some members calling for stronger sanctions against Russia and others advocating for a more aggressive approach.

That finding stems from an analysis of 15,632 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study II over a 10-year period beginning in 1991. A press release explains the women had not previously had gestational diabetes, and at four-year intervals answered questions related to their diet in the year prior.

The discovery was made by a team of researchers at Caltech, who used mathematical and computer modeling to identify the planet's existence. The team's findings suggest that the planet is about 2-4 times the diameter of Earth and orbits the sun at a distance of 10,000 to 20,000 years. The discovery was announced in the Astronomical Journal and has been hailed as a major breakthrough in the field of astronomy. The team's research was based on the observation that the orbits of several small, icy objects in the outer solar system were being perturbed by an unknown force. The researchers used computer simulations to model the orbits of these objects and found that they were consistent with the presence of a large, undiscovered planet. The discovery of the ninth planet has significant implications for our understanding of the solar system and the formation of the planets. The team's research suggests that the planet may have formed in the early days of the solar system and was later perturbed into its current orbit. The discovery of the ninth planet has also raised questions about the definition of a planet and whether Pluto should be reclassified as a dwarf planet.

The probe will have to withstand heat and radiation never before experienced by any spacecraft, but the specially designed mission will also address questions that couldn't be answered before. The mission's objectives include tracing the flow of energy that heats and accelerates the sun's corona and solar wind, determining the structure and dynamics of the plasma and magnetic fields at the sources of the solar wind, and exploring mechanisms that accelerate and transport energetic particles. The probe will eventually orbit within 3.7 million miles of the sun's surface, providing insight about the physics of stars, change what we know about the mysterious corona, increase understanding of solar wind, and help improve forecasting of major space weather events. The mission is scheduled to end in June 2025. The probe will be launched in the summer of 2018 and will make seven flybys of Venus, which will essentially give the probe a gravity assist, shrinking its orbit around the sun over the course of nearly seven years. The probe will eventually be closer to the sun than Mercury, and it will be close enough to watch solar wind whip up from subsonic to supersonic. The probe will reach a speed of 450,000 mph around the sun, and it will pass through the origin of the solar particles with the highest energy. The mission is a historic attempt to explore the sun's atmosphere, and it will provide unprecedented insights into the physics of the sun and the solar system. The probe will be equipped with a thermal protection system and a solar array cooling system to protect it from the blazing sun, and it will be able to withstand temperatures of up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit.

Trump called her controversial joke \"sad and a little flip,\" but he defended her explanation that it was meant as a good-natured way of praising a supporter. \"When I spoke to her—she called me—she said, 'I said something that I meant exactly very different,' and I heard an apology loud and clear,\" Trump said. As for Espy: \"How does he fit in with Mississippi?\" the president asked, as noted by CNBC. \"I mean, how does he fit in?\" The website FiveThirtyEight reports that a survey last week had Hyde-Smith up 54% to 44%.

The lake is believed to have existed about 3.7 billion years ago, which is more recently than previously thought. The rover's findings suggest that Mars may have had a more Earth-like environment in the past, with an alluvial fan and streams that fed into the lake.

The bill must still be passed by the Senate before it can become law. The legislation has been met with fierce opposition from the Roman Catholic Church and other religious groups, who argue that it would be a \"deceit\" that would rock the foundations of society and lead to discrimination between children. However, supporters of the bill argue that it would be a major advance for equality of rights and would allow all couples to unite themselves as they wish. The bill has won wide backing from gay rights advocates, who see it as a unique opportunity to put an end to outdated discrimination. France would join 11 other countries that allow same-sex marriages, including Spain, Sweden, South Africa, and the Netherlands. The issue of same-sex marriage has also been debated in other countries, including the UK, where lawmakers have approved the second reading of a bill to legalize same-sex marriage, and the US, where nine states and the District of Columbia have legalized same-sex marriage. However, many people remain vehemently opposed to the idea, with 30 states in the US having passed constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage. The issue has also divided Australia, where lawmakers voted against a bill to legalize same-sex marriage last September. Despite the opposition, polls show that the US public has gradually become more accepting of the idea, with more Americans in favor in 2013 than opposed. The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association reports that same-sex relations are still criminalized in 76 countries, and in five of those countries, the death penalty can be applied to those who violate the laws.

The discovery was announced by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, which controls the land on which the site was found. The team, led by University of Oregon archaeologist Patrick O'Grady, has been excavating at the site since 2011 and has uncovered a number of stone projectile points and tooth enamel fragments likely belonging to a prehistoric camel. The most exciting discovery, however, is a small stone tool found below a layer of volcanic ash that is believed to be around 15,800 years old. The tool, a hand-held scraper chipped from a piece of orange agate, was found about 8 inches below a layer of volcanic ash from an eruption of Mount St. Helens. The depth was about 12 feet below the surface. The discovery of this tool below a layer of undisturbed ash that dates to 15,800 years old means that this tool is likely more than 15,800 years old, which would suggest the oldest human occupation west of the Rockies. The team plans to continue digging this summer to see whether the volcanic ash covers the entire area and to provide further evidence of artifacts found consistently underneath that layer of volcanic ash. The discovery has the potential to change our understanding of human history in the western United States and has sparked excitement in the archaeological community.

Researchers compared brain scans of women before and after pregnancy and found differences in 11 locations. These changes may help women prepare for motherhood, such as understanding the needs of their infant. The study also found that women who became pregnant showed no signs of decline in memory tests. The brain changes were mostly still present two years after childbirth. The study suggests that the brain changes may be caused by sex hormones that flood the brain during pregnancy. The researchers think that the differences result from the reduction in volume of the brain's gray matter, which could reflect loss of brain cells or pruning of the places where brain cells communicate. The study found that the brain changes were not related to the type of conception, type of delivery, breastfeeding status, or number of fetuses. The study also found that the brain changes were not related to the time between parturition and the Post scan. The study used a longitudinal symmetric diffeomorphic modeling pipeline to analyze the brain scans. The researchers found that the brain changes were consistent across the study groups. The study suggests that the brain changes may be a universal response to pregnancy, rather than a response to specific factors. The study also found that the brain changes were not related to the age of the women or the time interval between the sessions.

The brain changes in the pregnancy group emerged from comparisons of those two groups. The results were consistent: A computer program could tell which women had gotten pregnant just by looking at results of the MRI scans. And the changes, first documented an average of 10 weeks after giving birth, were mostly still present two years after childbirth.

In 11 places in the brain, the MRI data indicate reductions in volume of the brain's gray matter, but it's not clear what that means. For example, it could reflect a pruning of the places where brain cells communicate, called synapses. Losing some synapses is not necessarily a bad thing. It happens during a hormonal surge in adolescence, producing more specialized and efficient brain circuits.

Ford's Progressive Conservative Party won a majority government, defeating the Liberal Party, which had been in power for 15 years. Ford's campaign focused on income tax cuts, reducing the price of gas, and eliminating the deficit while spending billions on transit and infrastructure projects. His party's platform was simple and effective, resonating with voters who were looking for change. Ford's control and discipline during the campaign were key factors in his success. He was able to keep his team together and focused on the key issues, which helped to build momentum and excitement around his campaign. Ford's victory was also due in part to the unpopularity of the Liberal Party and the NDP, which had been struggling to gain traction. The election was seen as a vindication for Ford's team, who had been criticized by naysayers and some in his own party. Ford's win was a surprise to many, but he was able to capitalize on the momentum and enthusiasm of his supporters. The election was a significant moment in Canadian politics, marking a shift towards a more conservative government in Ontario.

The Republicans are expected to target eight years of President Barack Obama's Democratic policies, including the Affordable Care Act, Social Security, and Medicare. Democrats will try to block the GOP's agenda by swaying public opinion and using the power they have in the Senate to filibuster legislation. The Republicans are also expected to push for tax reform, entitlement reform, and deregulation of the financial sector. The Senate will be the site of most contention over the GOP's agenda, with Democrats having the procedural tools to fight back. The Republicans will hold 52 seats to Democrats' 46, with Vice President-elect Mike Pence as the tie-breaker. The House is expected to reelect Speaker Paul D. Ryan as its first order of business, dispensing with the messy political infighting that has hobbled Republicans in the past. The Republicans are also expected to punish Democrats for last year's gun control sit-in, led by civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis, by imposing new rules that would slap up to $2,500 fines on lawmakers who film such floor protests from smartphones or other devices. The Republicans are also expected to push for a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, with a vote to repeal the law expected in February. The replacement will be much harder, in policy and logistics, with key leaders coalescing around a plan that would repeal Obamacare soon and then allow two to four years to figure out a replacement. The Republicans are also expected to push for tax reform, with a strong focus on lowering corporate income tax rates. The Ways and Means Committee has already drawn up a proposal to reduce corporate tax rates from 35 percent to 20 percent. The Republicans are also expected to push for entitlement reform, with a focus on restructuring Medicare and Medicaid to reduce costs. The GOP has long wanted to give states money for Medicaid in the form of block grants, and has also pushed varying degrees of privatization for Medicare. The Republicans are also expected to push for deregulation of the financial sector, particularly a rollback of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform package.

However, NCA has experienced challenges in implementing this plan, including acquiring suitable land for new national cemeteries, estimating costs, and using data to inform grant-making decisions. The Grants Program, which provides funding to state and tribal governments to establish, expand, or improve veterans’ cemeteries, has been used to increase veterans’ access to burial options. However, NCA has not made significant progress in implementing its plan, with only six of the planned 18 new sites open as of September 2019. The completion dates for the remaining sites have slipped multiple times, with some sites expected to take 5 years or longer to complete. NCA has revised its cost-estimating guidance to more fully reflect the 12 steps in the Cost Guide, but it still does not fully incorporate the 12 steps. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs should ensure that the Under Secretary for Memorial Affairs updates its cost-estimating procedures for cemetery construction projects to fully incorporate the 12 steps identified in the GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide. The VA concurred with the recommendation and stated that it would ensure that the Veterans Health Administration updates its cost-estimating guidance by incorporating the 12 steps outlined in the Cost Guide, as applicable. However, as of August 2019, VA had not taken any action to implement this recommendation. The guidance document it plans to update, the VA Manual, is also used by NCA.

Experts relay how casinos track and target addicted gamblers, supply ready flows of cash via on-site ATMs, and offer plenty of perks to keep them coming back.

The study suggests that the main reasons for people adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet are health, animal welfare, and environmental concerns. However, the study also found that the main reasons for people giving up a vegetarian or vegan diet are social pressures and difficulties inherent to the diet itself. The study also found that people who transition to a vegetarian or vegan diet quickly are more likely to give it up, and that people who have a strong social support system are more likely to stick to their diet. The study suggests that advocates for vegetarian or vegan diets should focus on promoting reduction rather than elimination of animal products, and that they should acknowledge the challenges of maintaining a vegetarian or vegan diet. In related news, a man who stopped eating meat in 1995 after watching a documentary and feeling his life was slipping away, has recently started eating meat again after trying fish and pepperoni pizza. He still hasn't tried real meat and is still a bit frightened of it. The man's experience is not unique, as many people struggle to stick to a vegetarian or vegan diet. A study by the Humane Research Council found that only 1 in 5 vegetarians and vegans maintains their diet, with 84% eventually reverting back to eating meat or other animal products. The study suggests that a slower approach to transitioning to a vegetarian or vegan diet may lead to longer-lasting results, and that health can be an effective \"foot in the door\" approach to increasing the number of vegetarians and vegans.

The first occurred when 19-year-old Nick Silvestri hopped up on the stage just before the start of Hand to God and plugged his phone into an outlet, not realizing it was a prop. He tells Playbill that it wasn't a joke and that he wasn't acting on a dare. He just needed to charge his iPhone. \"I saw the outlet and ran for it,\" he recalls. \"That was the only outlet I saw, so I thought, 'Why not?' I was thinking that they were probably going to plug something in there on the set, and I figured it wouldn't be a big deal if my phone was up there too.\" Security guards quickly moved in. After talking to Playbill, Silvestri even participated in a press conference and read a statement in which he apologized. \"I don't go to plays very much, and I didn't realize that the stage is considered off limits,\" he said, per Gothamist. (Variety notes that Hand to God, which has been struggling to sell tickets, was happy to capitalize by organizing that press conference.) The second incident occurred when Patti LuPone took the phone from an audience member who was texting during Show for Days.

In 2012, a team of experts from the UN's cultural body Unesco examined a wreck off the coast of Haiti and concluded that it was not the Santa Maria. The team believed that the wreck was from a much later period, citing the presence of copper alloy artefacts, which were not consistent with the Santa Maria's iron and/or wood fixations. Unesco has now planned to look for the Santa Maria in various locations, including on land and on the seabed. The organization's report has been criticized for ignoring 11-year-old photographic evidence of possible Columbus-era cannon on the site and for not conducting tests on the ballast from the wreck. The report also failed to assess the possibility of there being two wrecks on the site, one early and one later. Unesco's plan to look for the Santa Maria on land has been met with criticism from scholars, who argue that Columbus's vessel could not have reached the area due to shallow and dangerous reefs. The organization's decision to reject Barry Clifford's site, which was announced in May, has been seen as a controversial move. Clifford, an American explorer, had announced that he had discovered what might be Columbus's long-lost vessel. Unesco's report has also been criticized for its lack of transparency and for not providing sufficient evidence to support its conclusions.

UNESCO says the wreck is further from shore than accounts of Columbus' first voyage, and bronze or copper fasteners found at the site are evidence of shipbuilding techniques that date the ship to the late 17th or 18th century at the earliest.

The water was not properly treated, leading to high levels of lead in the drinking water, which caused serious health problems, especially in children. The crisis was exacerbated by the failure of government officials at various levels to take action to address the problem. The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) were accused of altering and manipulating data to cover up the crisis.

The charges included misconduct in office, conspiracy, and willful neglect of duty. The investigation was expected to continue, with Schuette stating that additional charges could be forthcoming. The crisis had drawn national attention, with President Barack Obama visiting Flint in May 2016 and speaking after a briefing from officials on response efforts to the lead poisoning.

The devices in Elizabeth apparently looked similar to what detonated in Seaside Park, New Jersey, on Saturday morning ahead of a race. The explosion in Elizabeth was caused by a device found in a trash can near a train station, which was detonated by a bomb squad robot. The device was unintentionally detonated, and no one was injured.

The strike was peaceful, with protesters blocking streets and marching on banks, but some vandalism occurred. The police presence was minimal, with Mayor Jean Quan promising a limited response. The protests were sparked by the police clearing of the Occupy Oakland encampment on October 25, 2011, which resulted in the injury of Scott Olsen, a former marine. The protests were also motivated by a desire to address economic inequality and social justice issues. The city administrator, Deanna Santana, emphasized the need for a safe and peaceful environment, while the police chief, Howard Jordan, reported no arrests and a minimal police presence. The protests were largely peaceful, with some vandalism and clashes between protesters and police. The police used tear gas and rubber bullets, but no serious injuries were reported.

The VA's National Cemetery Administration (NCA) maintains existing national cemeteries and builds new ones for the nation's veterans and their family members. NCA also provides funding through the VA's Veterans Cemetery Grants Program to help establish, expand, or improve state and tribal veterans' cemeteries. The VA's Grants Program has helped increase veterans' access to burial options, with NCA planning to open 18 new national cemeteries by the end of fiscal year 2017. However, NCA has experienced challenges in acquiring suitable land for new national cemeteries, estimating costs associated with establishing new national cemeteries, and using all available data to inform how its Grants Program targets unserved veteran populations. The VA's NCA has made some progress in implementing its plan to increase burial access for veterans, but it is years behind its original schedule. The VA's NCA has opened four new traditional national cemeteries and two rural initiative cemeteries, but the completion dates for all of these sites have slipped multiple times. The VA's NCA has also experienced challenges in estimating the costs associated with establishing new national cemeteries, with the cost estimates for seven rural initiative sites increasing significantly above what NCA officials had initially estimated. The VA's NCA uses multiple guidance documents on cost estimation, but its cost-estimating guidance does not fully incorporate the 12 steps presented in the GAO Cost Guide. The VA's NCA relies on states and tribal governments applying for funding to build new cemeteries or expand existing ones, but it does not have the authority to formally request that a state seek grant funding to expand access in an unserved area. The VA's NCA uses county-level population data to identify veteran population areas unserved by national, state, or tribal government veterans' cemeteries, but it could use census tract data to provide a more precise estimate of unserved veteran populations.

Turns out we're not as special as we thought. A type of bat also displays this hemispheric specialization when it comes to sound processing, Washington has discovered. In both humans and Parnell's mustached bats—a species that lives in an area ranging from Mexico to Brazil, RedOrbit reports—the left hemisphere handles quicker sounds, while the right deals with slower ones, a press release reports. For humans, the right hemisphere \"may allow us to identify who is speaking, to gauge their emotional state via tone of voice, and to tease out pitch in music,\" Washington notes. As for the left hemisphere, \"men largely use just the left hemisphere\" to process language, while women use both hemispheres to do so, Washington says. In mustached bats—named based on the hair springing from the sides of their snouts, Animal Diversity Web explains—the right hemisphere's slower processing is used for sonar, \"which relies on detecting small changes in frequency,\" says Washington, senior author of the study in Frontiers in Neuroscience. The left is used \"to distinguish communication sounds from each other, because (the bats') communication sounds have rapid changes in frequency.\" All this is more than just a matter of interest: The findings could help study human language disorders, especially since some study techniques \"can only be permitted in animals,\" Washington adds.

The case has raised questions about the city's \"sanctuary city\" policy, which allows law enforcement to ignore immigration detainers. The policy has been criticized by Republican lawmakers, including Senator Ron Johnson, who called for an investigation into the matter.

The two countries need to solve the problem of climate change together, as neither can solve it alone. Even if the US eliminated all its domestic greenhouse gas emissions, it would not be enough to counteract the carbon pollution coming from China and the rest of the world. The US and China have announced targets to reduce carbon emissions in the post-2020 period. The US intends to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. China has announced a peak year for its carbon emissions around 2030, along with a commitment to try to reach the peak earlier. China aims to expand the share of total energy consumption coming from zero-emission sources to around 20% by 2030. The US and China's announcement can inject momentum into the global climate negotiations, which resume in Lima, Peru, and culminate next year in Paris. The commitment of both presidents to take ambitious action in their own countries and work closely to remove obstacles on the road to Paris sends an important signal that they must get a global climate agreement done, that they can get it done, and that they will get it done. The US and China's relationship has produced something of great consequence in the fight against climate change. The announcement is a milestone in the US-China relationship, the outcome of a concerted effort that began last year in Beijing. The targets themselves are also important, as ambitious action by the two countries together is the foundation to build the low-carbon global economy needed to combat climate change.
