{"pred": " \nThe study, conducted by Kasumovic and Kuznekoff, aimed to understand the factors that trigger sexist behavior and the individuals that initiate it. They used an online first-person shooter video game, Halo 3, to examine how individual performance and social standing affect female-directed male behavior. The results showed that lower-skilled players were more hostile towards a female-voiced teammate, especially when performing poorly, while higher-skilled players were more positive towards a female teammate. The study suggests that low-status males increase female-directed hostility to minimize the loss of status as a consequence of hierarchical reconfiguration resulting from the entrance of a woman into the competitive arena. The findings support an evolutionary explanation of female-directed aggression, where low-status males respond to the threat female competitors pose to their social status. The study also found that men who are less-skilled at the game and performing worse relative to their peers tend to make frequent, nasty comments to female gamers, suggesting that sexist dudes are literally losers. The researchers argue that video games can be used as a proxy for studying real-life behavior, and that the findings have implications for understanding online harassment and sexism. The study suggests that the increase in hostility towards women by lower-status males may be an attempt to disregard a female's performance and suppress her disturbance on the hierarchy to retain their social rank.

Scientists who conducted the study published in Plos One played 163 games of Halo as either male-voiced players or female-voiced players (82 female, 81 male) with remote teammates and opponents. The study gauged a remote player's skill by measuring such factors like kills and deaths. Researchers found men were typically cordial to players they believed to be male, and that more skilled men who kicked first-shooter butt were less likely to direct negative comments toward female-voiced players than their less skilled male counterparts. But lamer players tended to take their frustrations out on female players with more frequent, caustic comments. A lead author notes that gaming provides the perfect breeding ground for this kind of behavior: After all, the Post notes, players can remain anonymous, they may never run into an online teammate or opponent again, and it's a significantly male-biased recreation. Females threaten gamers' \"pre-existing social hierarchy\"; the guys at the bottom of the virtual totem pole feel threatened and therefore become more threatening to those they think they can quash the easiest. \"As men often rely on aggression to maintain their dominant social status, the increase in hostility towards a woman by lower-status males may be an attempt to disregard a female's performance and suppress her disturbance on the hierarchy to retain their social rank,\" the study notes.

The law also reduces the early-voting period by a week, abolishes same-day voter registration, and ends straight-party voting. The law has been met with legal challenges in federal court, with two separate lawsuits filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Southern Coalition for Social Justice. The lawsuits argue that the law unduly burdens the right to vote and discriminates against African-American voters in violation of the U.S. Constitution's equal protection clause and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton has spoken out against stricter voter ID laws and the recent Supreme Court decision striking down a central component of the Voting Rights Act. Clinton criticized the laws as a \"sweeping effort to construct new obstacles to voting\" and argued that they have driven a disparity in access to the ballot, threatening to undermine the Voting Rights Act. Clinton also encouraged the Justice Department to more rigorously enforce voting laws left on the book and urged Congress to pass legislation to replace portions of the Voting Rights Act struck down by the Supreme Court. In related news, Hillary Clinton has joined her husband's foundation, which has been renamed for all three Clintons, and will focus on issues related to women and girls, early childhood development, and economic development. Clinton's arrival at the foundation comes as Chelsea Clinton has stepped up her role and after the organization's first outside review in a decade ended with a number of recommendations for tightening structure and management. Clinton's decision to join the foundation has been seen as a way for her to maintain a low public profile while still being involved in important issues.

According to the California Attorney General's database, there are 35 missing persons in the county, including men and women, and two small girls who have been missing since 1977. The sheriff's office attributes the high rate of missing persons to the county's remote location and the fact that many people come to the area to work in the cannabis industry, often without informing their families. However, an investigation by the North Coast Journal found that many of the missing persons cases are not as mysterious as they seem, with some individuals being reported missing due to estrangement or abuse, and others being out of communication due to lack of cell phone service. The investigation also found that the county's high rate of missing persons reports is partly due to the liberal standards for filing a missing persons report in California, which allows for reports to be filed without a waiting period or jurisdictional restrictions. A case study of the Humboldt 35 found that many of the missing persons were not actually missing, but rather had chosen to disappear or were out of communication due to various reasons. The investigation also highlighted the challenges faced by families of missing persons in searching for their loved ones, particularly in a remote area like Humboldt County. A notable case was that of Jeff Joseph, a dispensary owner who disappeared in 2014, and whose family has been searching for him ever since. The investigation also found that the Humboldt County Sheriff's Office has been working to improve its missing persons protocol, including entering missing persons into the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs). However, the investigation also raised concerns about the lack of standardization in reporting missing persons cases, with some cases being reported to the Attorney General's database but not to NamUs. A notable example of this was the case of Rebekah Martinez, who was reported missing in November 2017 but was later found to be alive and well, having appeared on the reality TV show \"The Bachelor\".

{"pred": " \nAntarctic notothenioid fish species have developed antifreeze proteins to survive in frigid waters. However, these proteins also prevent ice from melting, leading to a paradoxical situation where the fish must tolerate ice in their veins. A team of marine biologists discovered this trade-off while studying the coping mechanisms of notothenioid species living in cold conditions. They found that the antifreeze proteins' anti-melting properties prevent ice from melting even at temperatures above the freezing point, and that ice crystals persist inside the fish for most of their lives. This raises questions about the long-term cost of having these proteins, and whether the fish have evolved mechanisms to deal with the ice crystals. The study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. A subsequent study found that the ice crystals in the fish's bodies do not melt at their expected melting point, but instead remain intact due to the antifreeze protein. The researchers also found that the protein binds to the ice crystals and alters their surface, making it difficult for them to grow or melt. This phenomenon is known as \"superheating,\" and it may be the first example of its kind found in nature. The study suggests that the antifreeze protein has both beneficial and detrimental effects on the fish, and that further research is needed to understand the long-term consequences of having these proteins. The findings provide new insights into the evolution of antifreeze proteins and the adaptations of Antarctic fish species. Overall, the studies highlight the complex and multifaceted nature of evolutionary adaptations, and the need for further research to understand the intricacies of these processes.

However, DNA evidence later revealed that he was not the perpetrator, but rather the notorious \"teardrop rapist\" who committed over 30 similar crimes in the Los Angeles area. Vargas' conviction was overturned on November 23, 2015, after the California Innocence Project (CIP) took up his case in 2012 and filed a request to examine DNA collected from one of the victims. The DNA test results revealed that the genetic material found on the victim's clothing belonged to the teardrop rapist, not Vargas. The teardrop rapist was described as a middle-aged, small-build, Hispanic male with a teardrop tattoo under his eye, which matched the description of Vargas, but he had only one faded teardrop tattoo. The CIP noticed that the FBI's published description of the teardrop rapist's modus operandi was similar to the District Attorney's 1999 closing argument, suggesting that the prosecution had relied on eyewitness misidentification.

That man, who was never caught, is suspected of having committed about three dozen crimes in the LA area.

The practice was initially met with resistance and controversy, but many early members of the Church accepted it as a commandment from God. The practice of plural marriage was not universal among early members of the Church, and women were free to choose whether or not to enter into a polygamous union. The practice was introduced incrementally, and participants were asked to keep their actions confidential. The practice of plural marriage was not only a trial of faith for those who practiced it but also a source of controversy and opposition. The practice was eventually discontinued in 1890, when Church President Wilford Woodruff issued the Manifesto, which declared the Church's intention to submit to anti-polygamy laws. The practice of plural marriage was a complex and multifaceted issue, with both positive and negative consequences. The practice was seen as a way to increase the number of children born in the gospel covenant and to \"raise up seed unto [the Lord].\" However, it also led to difficulties and challenges for women and men who practiced it. The practice of plural marriage was eventually discontinued, but its legacy continues to be felt in the Church today. The Church has acknowledged the contribution of scholars to the historical content presented in this article, and the article was originally published in October 2014.

The essay explains that Smith was ordered to take multiple wives by an angel who visited him three times between 1834 and 1842; in the last instance, the angel was armed with a sword and threatened a reluctant Smith. The leader, then married to first wife Emma, took his first plural wife, Fanny Alger, in Kirtland, Ohio. Smith and Alger ultimately separated, and the church relocated to Nauvoo, Ill., where he married many more women. The oldest was 56, and the youngest was 14-year-old Helen Mar Kimball; some were already married, a revelation the New York Times describes as the \"biggest bombshell for some.\" The essay explains that a number of marriages, including that with Kimball, were sealed \"for eternity alone,\" suggesting sexual relations weren't involved (the ones that did involve sex were \"for time and eternity\").

According to reports, Rice requested the identities of U.S. persons in raw intelligence reports on dozens of occasions, which connected to the Trump transition and campaign.

The main arguments presented in the passages suggest that Rice's actions were likely within the law, but the motivations behind her requests are unclear. The key evidence presented includes reports from U.S. officials familiar with the matter, who stated that Rice's requests were made to understand why Trump transition officials were appearing in intelligence reports. However, the passages also highlight the potential for abuse of surveillance powers, particularly when senior officials like Rice request the unmasking of U.S. persons. The unique point made in the passages is that Rice's actions were not necessarily a partisan issue, but rather a concern about the potential for executive branch overreach. The controversy has sparked a debate about the balance between national security and civil liberties, with some arguing that Rice's actions were justified, while others see it as a threat to individual rights.

Trump critics, meanwhile, say the story doesn't amount to much and accuse the White House of trying to divert attention from the president's wiretapping allegations. A look at coverage: A key story comes from Eli Lake at Bloomberg News. He reported Monday that Rice requested the identities of Trump transition officials who were mentioned, but not named, in US intelligence reports. Those reports were mostly summaries of monitored conversations between foreign officials talking about the Trump transition, but sometimes between Trump associates and foreign officials. (The National Security Council logs of Rice's requests are apparently what Rep. Devin Nunes went to the White House to view.) Lake's piece raises questions about why Rice wanted those names revealed—she didn't respond to the story—but he also notes that her requests \"were likely within the law.\" He adds that the story doesn't \"vindicate\" Trump's unsupported accusation that Obama wiretapped Trump Tower. Adam Housley of Fox News also reported on Rice's requests, and his appearance on the network prompted Trump himself to weigh in via tweet: \"Such amazing reporting on unmasking and the crooked scheme against us by @foxandfriends.

It wants any Trump-Russia ties investigated, but complains that the \"media have been running like wildebeest after that story while ignoring how the Obama Administration might have abused domestic surveillance for its political purposes.

The conservative NewsBusters blog accused ABC, NBC, and CBS of covering up the story by failing to report on the \"massive revelation\" Monday in their evening broadcasts. On MSNBC Tuesday morning, frequent Trump critic Joe Scarborough blasted the New York Times for not having the story on its front page. \"What is Susan Rice unmasking names for and spreading them across the government,\" he asked on Morning Joe, per Mediaite. But the Times story on the subject (inside the paper) generally downplayed the significance of Rice's requests: \"Former national security officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, described the requests as normal and said they were justified by the need for the president’s top security adviser to understand the context of reports sent to her by the nation’s intelligence agencies.\""], "length": 6943}

{"pred": " \nThe Philippines is facing a humanitarian crisis after Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest storms ever recorded, left a trail of destruction and death in its wake. The official death toll has surpassed 2,300, but aid workers fear it could be much higher, with estimates suggesting over 10,000 people may have lost their lives. The storm has also left millions without access to food, water, and shelter, with many forced to resort to desperate measures such as looting and scavenging for food among the dead. The international community has responded with a massive aid effort, with the UK, US, and other countries sending planes, ships, and personnel to assist in the relief efforts. The US has deployed an aircraft carrier, the USS George Washington, which is expected to triple the number of available helicopters and deliver hundreds of thousands of gallons of water every day. The UK has also sent an aircraft carrier, HMS Illustrious, and a team of medical experts, while the European Commission has pledged $11m in aid. Despite the efforts, the situation remains dire, with widespread infrastructure damage and a lack of access to basic necessities. Aid workers are struggling to reach isolated areas, and there are reports of violence and looting in some areas. The Philippine government has imposed a nighttime curfew and deployed troops to maintain order, but the situation remains volatile. The international community is calling for continued support and aid to help the Philippines recover from the devastating storm. The aid effort is being hampered by logistical challenges, including damaged roads and ports, and a lack of fuel and power. The situation is expected to worsen in the coming days, with the risk of waterborne diseases such as cholera increasing due to the lack of clean water. The Philippine government has warned that the final death toll may be significantly lower than the initial estimate of 10,000, but the full extent of the damage and the number of casualties is still unknown. The international community is working to provide emergency shelter, water, and construction materials to help the Philippines rebuild and recover from the disaster. The World Food Programme has delivered nearly 25 tonnes of high-energy biscuits, and another 10 tonnes are on their way. The situation in Tacloban, one of the worst-hit cities, is particularly dire, with thousands of people still crammed into the airport desperate for a way out.

US planes are bringing in supplies and a medical ship is on the way; Britain is also sending an aircraft carrier, notes the BBC. In other developments: Supplies from the US and other countries are arriving, but some areas are still in desperate need of relief and \"the major challenge is logistics,\" a European Commission spokesman tells the LA Times. \"With all this aid arriving and at the same time, the various Philippine authorities—military, civilian structures, the Philippine Red Cross—trying to distribute aid to so many communities ... obviously there are bottlenecks.\" Lawlessness in the devastated city of Tacloban is also slowing the distribution of aid, the Guardian finds. A Red Cross convoy was allegedly hijacked by armed men and there are rumors that inmates who escaped during the storm have been ambushing people carrying supplies. Communist rebels have declared a ceasefire in disaster areas, but troops say there has been at least one attack. Some 2,357 people have been confirmed dead, but the toll is expected to rise significantly as remote areas hit hard by the storm are reached. In Tacloban, where bodies are being trucked to mass graves, the city administrator says he is sticking by his original estimate of 10,000 dead in the city alone. In a smaller city south of Tacloban, the devastation is even worse and a 16-member medical team from California is laboring in extreme conditions to help survivors, NBC finds.

They're soon expecting to see big problems like pneumonia, diarrhea, infections, and dehydration.

{"pred": " \nThe 2016 presidential election is likely to be a close contest between Hillary Clinton and the Republican nominee. Clinton's chances of winning are roughly 50/50, and the outcome will depend on various factors, including the economy, Obama's approval rating, and the Electoral College. The economy will matter to voters, but its performance is uncertain, and economists have shown little ability to predict economic growth more than six months in advance. The \"blue wall\" of Democratic states in the Electoral College is not as strong as it seems, and Clinton's chances of winning will depend on her ability to mobilize voters in swing states. The \"Emerging Democratic Majority\" theory, which suggests that demographic trends favor the Democratic Party, is likely to be a factor in the election, but its impact is uncertain. Clinton's personal unpopularity is not likely to hold her back in a race against a Republican nominee, who is likely to have no more personal appeal. Obama's job approval ratings have recovered since the midterm elections, and his approval ratings on handling the economy have risen sharply. The economy is currently on a course to leave the incumbent party in a stronger position, and Clinton is likely to benefit from this trend. However, the possibility of voter fatigue and a desire for change after three straight presidential terms for the Democratic Party is a potential challenge for Clinton. Ultimately, Clinton's chances of winning depend on her ability to connect with voters and present a compelling message, as well as the performance of the economy and the Republican nominee. The Democratic Party's reliance on corporate money and consultants has led to a lack of clear policies and a focus on \"politics of biography\" rather than real reform. Clinton's campaign has been criticized for its reliance on paid propaganda and its failure to present a clear message. The party needs a real debate and a leader who can spark a discussion on real reform of the economy.

The health worker had been in contact with several people, including his brother, who has developed symptoms similar to Marburg. However, testing on 11 potential cases, including the brother, came back negative. The Marburg virus has an incubation period of 5-10 days and causes symptoms similar to Ebola, including fever, chills, headache, and myalgia. The case-fatality rate for Marburg hemorrhagic fever is between 23-90%. The virus is spread through direct contact with the blood, tissues, or bodily fluids of an infected person or an infected primate or fruit bat. There is no specific treatment for Marburg, nor is there a proven vaccine or cure. Uganda has previously successfully handled similar situations of health threats involving Hemorrhagic fevers and has adequate capacity to deal with this health threat. The most recent Marburg outbreak in Uganda infected 15 people and killed four, and the outbreak lasted three weeks. The Marburg virus is closely related to Ebola and has a similar incubation period and symptoms. The virus is not particularly easy to catch, and if an outbreak is identified early and controlled, it is unlikely to escalate the way the current Ebola outbreak has in West Africa. There have been several outbreaks of Marburg hemorrhagic fever in the past, including in Germany, South Africa, Kenya, Russia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola, and Uganda. The largest outbreak occurred in Angola in 2004-2005, with 252 cases and 227 deaths. The virus has a high mortality rate, but it is not airborne and can be controlled with rigorous surveillance and disease control measures.

So far 11 of the quarantined have tested negative for Marburg, though they may be retested in a few days if the symptoms they've developed don't disappear. And those symptoms might sound familiar if you've been following the Ebola situation: Both viruses are members of the Filovirus family and manifest in similar ways, including fever, severe headache, and major bleeding, the Washington Post reports. Although many of the outbreaks recorded since Marburg was IDed in 1967 have been single cases, the fatality rate ranges from 23% to 90% (if you discount those single-case years), the CDC notes. Perhaps to mitigate increasing concern over Ebola after Thomas Duncan's death in Texas this week, CDC Director Thomas Frieden has been talking up efforts the CDC has undertaken in Uganda and emphasized that no further Marburg cases have been documented. \"That may not make headlines, but it does give us confidence that we can control Ebola in West Africa,\" he says, per CNN.

Chloe Goins, 24, told the Daily Mail she plans to make a full statement to Los Angeles police. Goins said she was 18 years old when she attended a party with a girlfriend at the famous Los Angeles home of Hugh Hefner. There, Goins said Hefner introduced the women to Cosby, who engaged them in conversation and allegedly gave them drinks. Goins said Cosby spiked her drink with a sedative before luring her to a bedroom in the Playboy mansion where he sexually assaulted her. Goins said she wants the star to 'pay' for all the women he has allegedly attacked and is coming forward to bring them justice. Meanwhile, a lawyer for a woman who says Bill Cosby sexually abused her when she was 15 stated in a recent court filing that he has interviewed two witnesses who corroborate her story. The woman, Judy Huth, has filed a sexual battery lawsuit against Cosby, which comes amid a flurry of allegations that he drugged and sexually assaulted more than a dozen women. Cosby's attorney Martin Singer is seeking to dismiss the suit and has called it an extortion attempt. The AP doesn't normally identify people who say they are victims of sexual abuse, but Huth has come forward publicly in the lawsuit and at a news conference. Los Angeles police are investigating Huth's allegations. The alleged attack happened in 1974, which is outside the statute of limitations for criminal charges. However, the new claim by Goins puts the alleged attack within the statute of limitations. Cosby has denied the allegations and his lawyer has questioned the accusers' credibility. Cosby has remained mostly silent about the allegations, though he commented in an interview over the weekend that the “black media” should remain “neutral” on the charges against him.

However, his focus on immigration may not be enough to counter Democratic enthusiasm in November. Trump has also been distancing himself from a potential Republican thumping on Election Day, telling confidants that he doesn't see the midterms as a referendum on himself. Instead, he blames House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for protecting their majorities in Congress.

Meanwhile, thousands of people were already camped out at a key early voting location in Houston on Monday morning, hours before voting was even set to begin.

The indictments are a result of new German legal guidance allowing the prosecution of former Nazis who can't be tied to specific killings.

Meisel's family is still unsure how she would respond to the charges, but she welcomes any chance to tell her story for the important lessons it teaches about tolerance and racism. The charges represent a new and vital chapter for survivors like Meisel, who have been seeking justice for decades.

The two defendants, both in their 90s, deny any knowledge of the killings, but prosecutors assume they were aware of the different killing methods and supported the killings as guards.

Railroad workers may qualify for daily unemployment and sickness benefits under the RUIA, which are paid in addition to any paid leave or private insurance an employee may have. The RUIA provides for employers to pay a surcharge if the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Account falls below an indexed threshold amount. The surcharge is added to the employer's tax rate, but the total tax rate plus the surcharge cannot exceed the maximum rate of 12.0%, unless the surcharge is 3.5%, in which case the maximum tax rate is increased to 12.5%.

A shootout between members of the Assad family in the Alawite heartland of Syria's northern coastal region and the detention of a prominent Alawite activist by the regime have hinted at unease within the community. While many Alawites have historically been persecuted under Sunni rule, they now fear being relegated to second-class status or killed by Sunnis exacting revenge for the months of bloodshed inflicted by the Alawite-dominated security forces. Despite these fears, the Alawites are critical for Assad's survival, and any split within the ruling family would be a significant development in the conflict.

Though Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has tried to shield Damascus, war has now reached the capital, the New York Times reports. The fighting isn't as intense as in other cities like Aleppo or Homs, but it's drastically increased since a few months ago: Checkpoints abound, kidnappings are common, bombings are increasing, and it's not safe to go out after dark. \"How soon before our city, our markets, are destroyed?\" wonders one resident. Similarly, Syria's wealthy—many of whom back the president—are now seeing their businesses hurt by the war, and some are losing faith in Assad, the AP reports. Many have seen factories burned or otherwise affected by fighting, and others have had their money restricted by sanctions. Yet more trouble for Assad: Even his own sect, the Alawite minority, is growing discontent, the Washington Post reports.

{"pred": " \nResearchers have found that people can accurately assess the intelligence of men by looking at their faces, but not women. The study, which used static facial photographs of 80 men and 80 women, found that people could accurately evaluate the intelligence of men based on facial photographs, but not women. The researchers used geometric morphometrics to determine which facial traits are associated with the perception of intelligence, and found that faces perceived as highly intelligent are rather prolonged with a broader distance between the eyes, a larger nose, a slight upturn to the corners of the mouth, and a sharper, pointing, less rounded chin. However, the study found no correlation between morphological traits and real intelligence measured with IQ test, either in men or women. The researchers proposed several explanations for why people can accurately assess the intelligence of men but not women, including the possibility that cues of higher intelligence are sexually dimorphic and are thus apparent only in men's faces. The study also found that perceived intelligence positively correlated with attractiveness in both men and women, but that there was no significant correlation between measured IQ and attractiveness. The researchers suggested that the attribution of intelligence in women's faces may be influenced by the strong halo effect of attractiveness, which may prevent an accurate assessment of intelligence. Overall, the study provides new insights into the relationship between facial appearance and intelligence, and highlights the complexity of human perception and judgment. The study's findings have implications for our understanding of human evolution and the role of intelligence in social interaction. The researchers also suggested that the study's findings may have implications for the development of new methods for assessing intelligence, and for the design of more effective interventions to promote social and cognitive development.

On the right, she is being accused of abusing her power while in office to \"unmask,\" for political advantage, the names of Trump associates caught up in intelligence surveillance. Trump critics, meanwhile, say the story doesn't amount to much and accuse the White House of trying to divert attention from the president's wiretapping allegations. A look at coverage: A key story comes from Eli Lake at Bloomberg News. He reported Monday that Rice requested the identities of Trump transition officials who were mentioned, but not named, in US intelligence reports. Those reports were mostly summaries of monitored conversations between foreign officials talking about the Trump transition, but sometimes between Trump associates and foreign officials. (The National Security Council logs of Rice's requests are apparently what Rep. Devin Nunes went to the White House to view.) Lake's piece raises questions about why Rice wanted those names revealed—she didn't respond to the story—but he also notes that her requests \"were likely within the law.\" He adds that the story doesn't \"vindicate\" Trump's unsupported accusation that Obama wiretapped Trump Tower. Adam Housley of Fox News also reported on Rice's requests, and his appearance on the network prompted Trump himself to weigh in via tweet: \"Such amazing reporting on unmasking and the crooked scheme against us by @foxandfriends. 'Spied on before nomination.' The real story.\" A post at Slate notes that Trump associates are under FBI investigation over allegedly improper communications with Russians, \"so there may well have been urgent, legal reasons for Rice to have wanted information about the relationships between specific Trump-related figures and foreign individuals.\" But the editorial page at the Wall Street Journal accuses the media and Democrats of hypocrisy. It wants any Trump-Russia ties investigated, but complains that the \"media have been running like wildebeest after that story while ignoring how the Obama Administration might have abused domestic surveillance for its political purposes. Americans deserve to know the truth about both.\" On CNN, Don Lemon accused the \"right-wing media\" of helping the White House try to divert attention from the controversy over Trump's wiretapping claims, adding that his show will not \"aid and abet people who are trying to misinform you, the American people, by creating a diversion,\" he said, per Mediaite. The conservative NewsBusters blog accused ABC, NBC, and CBS of covering up the story by failing to report on the \"massive revelation\" Monday in their evening broadcasts. On MSNBC Tuesday morning, frequent Trump critic Joe Scarborough blasted the New York Times for not having the story on its front page. \"What is Susan Rice unmasking names for and spreading them across the government,\" he asked on Morning Joe, per Mediaite. But the Times story on the subject (inside the paper) generally downplayed the significance of Rice's requests: \"Former national security officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, described the requests as normal and said they were justified by the need for the president’s top security adviser to understand the context of reports sent to her by the nation’s intelligence agencies.\""], "length": 6943}

{"pred": " \nAstronomers Mike Brown and Konstantin Batygin have found evidence of a ninth planet in our solar system, which they call Planet Nine. The planet is estimated to be five to 10 times the mass of Earth and is thought to be an icy, rocky world with a small envelope of gas. The discovery was made by analyzing the motion of recently discovered dwarf planets and other small objects in the outer solar system, which appear to be influenced by the gravity of a hidden planet. The researchers used mathematical equations and computer models to conclude that the best explanation for the smaller objects' clustering was the gravitational effects of something far bigger. The existence of Planet Nine would reconfigure the models of the solar system and could potentially lead to a reclassification of Pluto, which was demoted from planet status in 2006. Brown, who was instrumental in Pluto's demotion, believes that Planet Nine is a planet and that it fits the criteria set by the International Astronomical Union. He also thinks that the discovery of Planet Nine could help to settle the debate over Pluto's status and that it is more interesting to be going to a new type of object rather than an oddball planet on the edge of the solar system. The discovery of Planet Nine has sparked renewed interest in the possibility of a ninth planet and has led to a re-examination of the definition of a planet. The researchers believe that the discovery of Planet Nine could be made within a couple of years, and they are hopeful that it will be spotted directly with a telescope. Brown and Batygin's paper has provided convincing evidence for a new planet in the solar system, and experts agree that the discovery of Planet Nine is a significant breakthrough in the field of astronomy.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes.

Here's what critics are saying about the latest installment of the franchise, with director Ridley Scott of 1979's Alien returning: The filmmakers have finally managed to \"dig the series out of its hole,\" Todd McCarthy puts it at the Hollywood Reporter. He calls Alien: Covenant \"the most satisfying entry in the six-films-and-counting franchise since the first two.\" Beautiful and gripping, it \"feels vital\" and is \"keen to keep us on our toes right up to the concluding scene, which leaves the audience with such a great reveal that it makes you want to see the next installment tomorrow.\" Peter Howell at the Toronto Star agrees this flick \"ranks among the better chapters\" of the franchise. Scott \"breaks new ground even while revisiting old concepts\" and \"brings back the visceral panic that fans expect.\" Actors Katherine Waterston, Danny McBride, Billy Crudup, and Michael Fassbender—who delivers \"a grand performance times two\" as two separate robots—also deserve high praise, he writes. The inclusion of Fassbender's David, from 2012's Prometheus, was an incredibly smart move, writes Joe Morgenstern at the Wall Street Journal. But there was little else that impressed him. There's just \"nothing new\" to this \"gore fest,\" he writes. He acknowledges, however, that \"many Alien fans will come looking for something old, and that's in bloodily abundant supply.\" Chris Klimek had his own issues with the film. For example, \"a religious subtext is introduced and then immediately abandoned,\" he writes at NPR. But he, too, had to marvel at Fassbender, whose \"existential rap session\" provides the \"freshest part of the movie.\" Then again, Fassbender's David \"is the only character in whom Scott seems truly interested,\" he writes."], "length": 5457}

{"pred": " \nThe Pacific sardine fishery is experiencing a severe population decline, which has significant implications for the West Coast ecosystem. The decline has led to steep cuts in the amount fishermen are allowed to catch, and scientists warn that the effects are probably radiating throughout the ecosystem, starving brown pelicans, sea lions, and other predators that rely on sardines for food. The reason for the drop is unclear, but a naturally occurring climate cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation may be a contributing factor. The population has dropped 72% since its last peak in 2006, and spawning has taken a dive too. Environmental groups have argued that the catch should be halted outright, citing the potential for continued fishing to speed the decline and arrest any recovery. The Pacific sardine is a quintessential boom-bust fish, with its numbers wildly unpredictable and surging up and down in decades-long cycles in response to natural shifts in the ocean environment. The West Coast's last sardine decline began in 1999, but the population shot back up by the mid-2000s. Scientists have gained a deeper understanding of sardines' value as \"forage fish,\" small but nutrition-packed species that form the core of the ocean food web. Research indicates that nursing sea lion mothers could not find fatty sardines, so they fed on less nutritious market squid, rockfish, and hake, and produced less milk for their young in 2012. The following year, their pups showed up on the coast in overwhelming numbers, stranded and emaciated. The Pacific Fishery Management Council should set conservative catch limits on sardines when the population is so low and fulfill its commitment to prohibit unregulated fishing on forage fish species. The decline of sardines has significant implications for the West Coast ecosystem, and continued fishing may speed the decline and arrest any recovery. The Pacific sardine is a quintessential boom-bust fish, with its numbers wildly unpredictable and surging up and down in decades-long cycles in response to natural shifts in the ocean environment. The West Coast's last sardine decline began in 1999, but the population shot back up by the mid-2000s. Scientists have gained a deeper understanding of sardines' value as \"forage fish,\" small but nutrition-packed species that form the core of the ocean food web. Research indicates that nursing sea lion mothers could not find fatty sardines, so they fed on less nutritious market squid, rockfish, and h", "answers": ["The West Coast sardine population was down 72% since 2006 per a fall assessment—the worst crash since the mid-20th century, and one with far-reaching implications, particularly since the steep decline is expected to continue. One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing. Last month, Pew Charitable Trusts warned that dozens of species, including whales, sharks, dolphins, salmon, and tuna, could feel an impact."], "length": 5107}
{"pred": " \nA Canadian judge, Robin Camp, has resigned after a disciplinary panel recommended his removal from the bench due to his handling of a 2014 rape trial. Camp had asked the complainant why she did not keep her knees together and mocked the law of consent. The Canadian Judicial Council (CJC) found that Camp's conduct was \"so manifestly and profoundly destructive of the concept of impartiality, integrity and independence of the judicial role\" that public confidence in the system was undermined. Camp apologized for his comments and underwent counseling, but the CJC deemed his actions insufficient to restore public confidence. The resignation is a rare instance of a judge being removed from the bench in Canada, with only two other judges facing similar disciplinary action since the CJC was established in 1971. The case highlights the need for judges to be properly trained in handling sexual assault cases, with the Canadian government introducing legislation to require better training for judges. The incident also sparked debate about the handling of sexual assault cases in the justice system, with some arguing that judges need to be more empathetic and understanding of victims' experiences. The CJC's decision is seen as a \"watershed moment\" in how courts treat sexual assault, with some experts calling for mandatory judicial training on gendered issues such as sexual assault, domestic violence, and sexual harassment. The case also raises questions about the role of judges in upholding the law and ensuring justice is served, particularly in cases involving vulnerable victims. Overall, the incident highlights the importance of ensuring that judges are equipped to handle sensitive and complex cases, and that the justice system is fair and just for all parties involved.  The resignation of Judge Camp is a significant development in the Canadian justice system, and it is expected to have a lasting impact on how judges handle sexual assault cases in the future.

This finding may be an important clue to understanding the mysterious parts of the universe that make up 95 percent of everything and don't emit light, such as dark energy, dark matter, and dark radiation. The discrepancy between the new measurement and the predicted expansion rate from the Big Bang may be due to unknown subatomic particles, dark energy, or an incomplete understanding of Einstein's theory of relativity. The new measurement was made by refining the universe's current expansion rate to unprecedented accuracy, reducing the uncertainty to only 2.4 percent. The team used innovative techniques that improved the precision of distance measurements to faraway galaxies. The results will appear in an upcoming issue of The Astrophysical Journal. The universe's excessive speed may be telling astronomers that dark matter possesses some weird, unexpected characteristics or that Einstein's theory of gravity is incomplete. The Hubble Space Telescope is a project of international cooperation between NASA and the European Space Agency. The Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in Baltimore, Maryland, conducts Hubble science operations. The universe is expanding at an accelerating rate, and the new measurement of the universe's expansion rate is about 73.24 kilometers per second per megaparsec, which is somewhere between five and nine percent faster than previously thought. The discrepancy may be due to unknown subatomic particles, dark energy, or an incomplete understanding of Einstein's theory of relativity. The new measurement was made by analyzing two types of star: Cepheids and Type la supernovae. The researchers measured about 2,400 Cepheid stars occupying 19 nearby galaxies, compared the apparent brightness of both types of star, and were able to determine the true brightness of the Type la supernovae.

This discrepancy has sparked debate among scientists, with some suggesting that dark energy, a mysterious force thought to be responsible for the acceleration of the universe's expansion, may be stronger than previously believed. Others propose that dark matter, a type of matter that does not emit light, may have some unknown properties that are affecting the expansion rate. Additionally, some scientists have suggested that Einstein's theory of relativity may be incomplete, which could also explain the discrepancy. The new measurements, which have a margin of error of only 2.4%, were made using data from the Hubble Space Telescope and the Keck I telescope, and involved analyzing the brightness of Cepheid stars and Type Ia supernovae to determine the distance to galaxies. The results suggest that the universe is expanding at a rate of 73.24 kilometers per second per megaparsec, which is faster than the rate predicted by observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation. The discrepancy between the two rates has significant implications for our understanding of the universe, and scientists are continuing to study the data to try to resolve the issue. The findings have been published in the Astrophysical Journal and have sparked a lively debate among scientists about the nature of the universe and the forces that are driving its expansion. The discrepancy has also raised questions about the accuracy of Einstein's theory of relativity, which has been a cornerstone of modern physics for over a century. Overall, the new measurements have provided a fascinating glimpse into the workings of the universe and have highlighted the need for further research into the nature of dark matter and dark energy. The universe's expansion rate is a key area of study in cosmology, and the new findings have significant implications for our understanding of the universe's evolution and fate. The discrepancy between the predicted and observed expansion rates has sparked a lively debate among scientists, with some arguing that the discrepancy is due to a mistake in the calculations, while others propose that it may be evidence of new physics beyond our current understanding. The study's lead author, Adam Riess, has stated that the discrepancy is a \"problem\" that needs to be addressed, and that it may be evidence that our understanding of the universe is incomplete. The findings have been met with a mix of excitement and skepticism, with some scientists hailing the discovery as a major breakthrough, while others have expressed caution and called for further verification of", "answers": ["New calculations in the cosmos have revealed a surprise: The universe appears to be expanding faster than anyone thought. Using the Hubble Space Telescope, scientists measured the distance to stars in 19 galaxies and concluded that the universe is growing 5% to 9% quicker than expected, the researchers say in a press release. For the record, they calculate the rate to be 45.5 miles per second per megaparsec, the latter being the equivalent of 3.26 million light-years. It's surprising, UPI reports, because astronomers expected the calculations to jibe with previous ones conducted by NASA and the European Space Agency. If the new rate is confirmed, it could challenge some basic precepts about how the universe functions and challenge at least part of Einstein's theory of relativity, reports the Guardian. \"If you really believe our number—and we have shed blood, sweat and tears to get our measurement right and to accurately understand the uncertainties—then it leads to the conclusion that there is a problem with predictions based on measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation, the leftover glow from the Big Bang,\" says co-author Alex Filippenko of Berkeley, per the Christian Science Monitor. While 5% to 9% may not seem like a big deal, it constitutes a \"major discrepancy\" in this particular case, notes Gizmodo. Part of the answer around the discrepancy may lie in the \"mysterious parts of the universe that make up 95% of everything and don't emit light, such as dark energy, dark matter, and dark radiation,\" says another of the project's researchers.

The negotiations were reportedly sparked by Olbermann's desire for a higher salary, which NBC was unwilling to provide. As a result, Olbermann agreed to an exit package worth over $7 million, which includes a ban on appearing on television for a certain period of time. However, it is expected that Olbermann will reappear on the internet, where he will continue to share his opinions and commentary.\n\nMeanwhile, there are rumors that Olbermann may be considering a move to Hollywood, where he could potentially contribute to Aaron Sorkin's new TV project. Sorkin's project is a behind-the-scenes look at a cable news show, and Olbermann's experience and expertise would make him a valuable asset to the project.\n\nIn other news, the New York Yankees are struggling with a series of injuries to key players, including Mark Teixeira, Curtis Granderson, and Derek Jeter. The team's defense has been particularly affected, with the loss of Teixeira and Granderson leading to a series of costly errors. The team's bullpen has also been a concern, with the Yankees relying on a number of untested pitchers to fill the void.\n\nThe Toronto Blue Jays are also facing challenges, including a lack of depth in their rotation and a reliance on a number of free agent signings.

The Marburg virus was first identified in 1967 in Germany and Yugoslavia, and since then, there have been a dozen outbreaks on record, many involving just a single patient. The virus causes symptoms similar to Ebola, including fever, weakness, and internal or external bleeding, and the death rate can be as high as 80%. In the most recent outbreak in Uganda in 2012, four out of 15 patients died. The virus is difficult to diagnose, especially if only a single case is involved, as the symptoms are similar to those of other infectious diseases. The Ugandan government has put in place measures to contain the outbreak, including contact tracing and testing, and there have been no additional cases reported.

Instead, he became what SI says was \"a jheri-curled version of a phantom.\" \"It's like he turned the lights out on his existence,\" an ex-Houston player says in the documentary. But Rives, with the help of former teammate and ex-Chicago cop Eric Davis, followed a bunch of leads until they tracked him down in a rental apartment outside of Detroit. The SI reveal doesn't tell much about Anders' current state of affairs, other than noting he works in a local restaurant and \"looks good … weighing far less than 350 pounds, as was rumored.\" Fans will have to wait for the ESPN movie to find out more.

The first occurred when 19-year-old Nick Silvestri hopped up on the stage just before the start of Hand to God and plugged his phone into an outlet, not realizing it was a prop. He tells Playbill that it wasn't a joke and that he wasn't acting on a dare. He just needed to charge his iPhone. \"I saw the outlet and ran for it,\" he recalls. \"That was the only outlet I saw, so I thought, 'Why not?' I was thinking that they were probably going to plug something in there on the set, and I figured it wouldn't be a big deal if my phone was up there too.\" Security guards quickly moved in. After talking to Playbill, Silvestri even participated in a press conference and read a statement in which he apologized. \"I don't go to plays very much, and I didn't realize that the stage is considered off limits,\" he said, per Gothamist.

The system, first proposed by Elon Musk, would transport passengers in vacuum-sealed tubes at speeds of up to 700 mph, reducing travel time between cities to just a few minutes. Several companies, including Hyperloop Transportation Technologies (HTT) and Hyperloop One, are competing to develop the technology. HTT has announced a passive magnetic levitation system, which would eliminate the need for power stations along the track and keep construction costs low. The system would use magnets on the pods to react with coils in the tubes, generating lift and levitation. This approach is more cost-effective than traditional magnetic levitation technology used in high-speed trains.\n\nHowever, critics have raised concerns about the safety and feasibility of the Hyperloop. One of the main challenges is the human body's ability to withstand high speeds and frequent acceleration and deceleration. At high speeds, the human body can experience G-forces that can cause nausea and discomfort. To mitigate this issue, some teams are building prototypes that can move at slower speeds, such as 240 mph. The Hyperloop also faces significant infrastructure and regulatory hurdles, including land rights and bureaucratic obstacles.\n\nDespite these challenges, several companies are making progress in developing the Hyperloop technology. HTT has filed a permit to build a 5-mile prototype in Quay Valley, a planned community in California. Hyperloop One has also successfully tested its linear induction propulsion system, which could be a key component of the Hyperloop system. The company's test sled reached speeds of 115 mph, and the team plans to conduct further testing to achieve higher speeds. The Hyperloop has the potential to revolutionize transportation, but it will require significant investment and cooperation from governments and private companies to overcome the technical and regulatory challenges.

The dossier, which was compiled under contract to both Republican and Democratic opponents of Trump, contains claims of Trump's alleged ties to Russian oligarchs and his supposed susceptibility to blackmail by the Russian government. However, Trump has denied the allegations, calling them \"completely fabricated.\" The controversy has sparked a heated debate about the legitimacy of Trump's presidency, with some Democrats questioning his ability to serve as president due to his alleged ties to Russia. The FBI has been investigating the allegations, but has not yet confirmed or denied them. The controversy has also raised questions about the role of the intelligence community in the election and the potential for foreign interference in the democratic process. The Anti-Defamation League and the Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect have condemned Trump's response to the allegations, calling it \"insensitive\" and \"coarsening\" to the discourse. The controversy has also highlighted the need for greater transparency and accountability in the intelligence community and the potential for the use of unverified information in the media.

Sources tell the Wall Street Journal that the document was prepared by Christopher Steele, a former Russia expert in Britain's spy service who founded the Orbis Business Intelligence research firm in 2009. The New York Times, in a look at how the dossier came to light, reports that Steele was hired by Washington research firm Fusion GPS, which was hired by a wealthy GOP donor in the fall of 2015 to compile anti-Trump material. After Trump became the presumptive nominee, the GOP donor no longer needed the research firm's services, but wealthy Democratic donors stepped in, and Steele continued to send monthly memos detailing alleged Russian efforts to both compromise Trump and assist his campaign, per the Times' sources. In other coverage: The Guardian looks at John McCain's involvement, which apparently included clandestine efforts to obtain the dossier after hearing about it from a diplomat during a conference in Canada. \"Upon examination of the contents, and unable to make a judgment about their accuracy, I delivered the information to the director of the FBI,\" McCain said in a statement Wednesday. The AP reports that it has been unable to contact Steele. A neighbor of the former spy, who lives outside London, says Steele and his family are away and it's not clear when they will return. Intelligence chiefs are defending their decision to take the very unusual step of attaching a summary of the unverified dossier to last week's briefing on Russian hacking, the Washington Post reports. \"Part of our obligation is to ensure that policymakers are provided with the fullest possible picture of any matters that might affect national security,\" Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Wednesday. He said he spoke with Trump and expressed dismay at the \"extremely corrosive\" leaks in the press. Early Thursday, Trump tweeted that Clapper had called him \"to denounce the false and fictitious report that was illegally circulated.\" He added: \"Made up, phony facts.Too bad!\" Politico looks at how Democrats are dealing with Trump's Russia troubles. So far, senators have been more restrained than House members, some of whom have started referring to Trump as \"Moscow Donald.\" The New York Times reports that Trump is facing a backlash from Jewish groups for wondering if we \"are living in Nazi Germany\" when he was criticizing intelligence agencies' handling of what he called \"fake news.\" At the Intercept, Glenn Greenwald calls the dossier \"farcical\" and warns that this episode could backfire badly for Democratic operatives and others treating the dossier as gospel. He warns that if it is proved false, it will \"forever discredit ... future journalistic exposés that are based on actual, corroborated wrongdoing.\""], "length": 6932}
{"pred": " \nThe Pacific sardine fishery is facing a severe population decline, which has significant implications for the West Coast ecosystem. The decline has prompted steep cuts in the catch limits, but some environmental groups argue that fishing should be halted altogether. Scientists are unsure of the cause of the decline, but research suggests that it may be linked to a naturally occurring climate cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. The sardine population is crucial for the food chain, and its decline has already led to malnourished sea lion pups and other predators starving without their primary food source. The Pacific Fishery Management Council should take action to protect the sardine population, including setting conservative catch limits and prohibiting unregulated fishing on forage fish species. The sardine fishery has a history of boom and bust cycles, with the population fluctuating wildly in response to ocean conditions. The current decline is the steepest since the mid-20th century, and experts warn that if the sardine population does not recover soon, the West Coast's marine mammals, seabirds, and fishermen could suffer for years. The value of forage fish like sardines is significant, with scientists estimating that they are worth twice as much when left in the water as they are when caught. The Pacific sardine is a quintessential boom-bust fish, and its numbers are wildly unpredictable, surging up and down in decades-long cycles in response to natural shifts in the ocean environment. The current decline has raised alarm, and researchers are posing the same question that was debated in the 1940s: how much of the collapse is caused by ocean conditions and how much by overfishing. The West Coast's last sardine decline began in 1999, but the population shot back up by the mid-2000s, and scientists are unsure of what caused the current decline. The scarcity of prey is the leading theory behind the malnourished sea lion pups that washed up on beaches in 2013, and research indicates that nursing sea lion mothers could not find fatty sardines, leading to their pups being stranded and emaciated. The Pacific Fishery Management Council should take action to protect the sardine population and ensure the long-term sustainability of the fishery. The value of forage fish like sardines is significant, and their decline has significant implications for the West Coast ecosystem. The sardine fishery has a history of boom and bust cycles, and the current decline is the steepest", "answers": ["The West Coast sardine population was down 72% since 2006 per a fall assessment—the worst crash since the mid-20th century, and one with far-reaching implications, particularly since the steep decline is expected to continue. One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing. Last month, Pew Charitable Trusts warned that dozens of species, including whales, sharks, dolphins, salmon, and tuna, could feel an impact."], "length": 6554}

Chloe Goins, 24, told the Daily Mail she plans to make a full statement to Los Angeles police. Goins said she was 18 years old when she attended a party with a girlfriend at the famous Los Angeles home of Hugh Hefner. There, Goins said Hefner introduced the women to Cosby, who engaged them in conversation and allegedly gave them drinks. Goins said Cosby escorted her to one of the mansion’s many bedrooms so she could rest, but she does not remember entering the bedroom. Goins said her next memory was waking up “butt naked” on a bed with a half-naked Cosby hunched over her, licking her toes and pleasuring himself. Goins said she believes Cosby had groped her body and licked her breasts. Goins’ claim is the latest to hit Cosby, who has seen his reputation as one of America's most significant comedy figures eviscerated in recent weeks. He is now facing more than 20 separate allegations of rape or sexual assault – many dating back 30 or 40 years. Goins’ case is so recent that it is not covered by any statutes of limitation, which affects other allegations. Goins said she wants the star to 'pay' for all the women he has allegedly attacked and is coming forward to bring them justice. Goins’ lawyer has told MailOnline has already made contact with the LAPD and Goins will likely meet with detectives to give a statement in the coming days.

However, Rose's sister, Shaniece Luke, and her lawyers argue that the bill is in retaliation for filing a wrongful death lawsuit against the state agency and the Queens developmental center where her brother died. They claim that the state is trying to punish them for bringing attention to the abuse and neglect that led to Rose's death. The medical examiner's report concluded that Rose died from injuries caused by being physically restrained, and an investigation found that at least three staff members, including a 275-pound worker who sat on him, were involved in his death. The state's actions have been widely criticized, with Assemblyman Harvey Weisenberg calling it \"retaliation\" and \"an outrage\" to send the bill to someone who lost a loved one from abusive care.

The victims were discovered after a 17-year-old girl escaped from the house and called 911, claiming that her 12 brothers and sisters were being held captive. The girl, who appeared to be only 10 years old and slightly emaciated, was interviewed by police and led them to the house where they found the other victims. The victims were found to be malnourished and dirty, with some chained to their beds with chains and padlocks. The parents, David and Louise Turpin, were arrested and charged with torture and child endangerment, with bail set at $9 million each. The Turpins had been living in the house with their 13 children since 2014, and had been operating a private school, Sandcastle Day School, out of their home. The school had an enrollment of six students, and the Turpins had been listed as the principal and homemaker, respectively. The case has shocked the community, with neighbors describing the family as \"very pale\" and \"very protective\" of their children. The Turpins had also been posting photos on social media of their family outings, including a vow renewal ceremony at the Elvis Chapel in Las Vegas. The case has raised questions about how the abuse went undetected for so long, and how the Turpins were able to operate a private school out of their home without raising any suspicions. The victims are currently being treated at local hospitals, and the case is ongoing. The Turpins' mother, Betty, has defended her son and daughter-in-law, saying that they are a \"highly respectable family\" and that they were very protective of their children. However, the evidence presented in the case suggests that the Turpins were hiding a dark secret, and that their children were being subjected to physical and emotional abuse.

Chloe Goins, 24, told the Daily Mail she plans to make a full statement to Los Angeles police. Goins said she was 18 years old when she attended a party with a girlfriend at the famous Los Angeles home of Hugh Hefner. There, Goins said Hefner introduced the women to Cosby, who engaged them in conversation and allegedly gave them drinks. Goins said Cosby escorted her to one of the mansion’s many bedrooms so she could rest, but she does not remember entering the bedroom. Goins said her next memory was waking up “butt naked” on a bed with a half-naked Cosby hunched over her, licking her toes and pleasuring himself. Goins said she believes Cosby had groped her body and licked her breasts. Goins’ claim is the latest to hit Cosby, who has seen his reputation as one of America's most significant comedy figures eviscerated in recent weeks. He is now facing more than 20 separate allegations of rape or sexual assault – many dating back 30 or 40 years. Goins’ case is so recent that it is not covered by any statutes of limitation, which affects other allegations. Goins said she wants the star to 'pay' for all the women he has allegedly attacked and is coming forward to bring them justice. Goins’ lawyer has told MailOnline has already made contact with the LAPD and Goins will likely meet with detectives to give a statement in the coming days. Goins, a model and lap dancer originally from San Diego but currently working in Las Vegas, says she felt compelled to come forward to add her voice to the dozens of women who have already made allegations against Cosby, 78. Goins said reading some of the victim's accounts in the media brought back the chilling memories of that night.

The Humboldt County Sheriff's Office has reported that many missing persons cases are resolved within days or weeks, but some cases remain unsolved for years. The county's high rate of missing persons reports is also attributed to the high number of homeless individuals in the area, who often fall out of touch with their loved ones. The Humboldt County Sheriff's Office has emphasized that the county is a good place to disappear, and that many people come to the area to work in the cannabis industry, leaving town to work on remote mountains where there is no cell phone service. The county's high rate of missing persons reports has led to the creation of a national database, the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs), which connects each case with a caseworker who compares it against reports, looks for patterns, and collaborates with families and local law enforcement. A recent case of a missing woman, Bekah Martinez, who was reported missing in Humboldt County but was later found on the reality TV show \"The Bachelor,\" highlights the challenges of tracking down missing individuals in the county. Martinez's case was removed from the California Department of Justice's website after she was contacted by the Humboldt County Sheriff's Office and confirmed that she was safe.

Chloe Goins, 24, told the Daily Mail she plans to make a full statement to Los Angeles police. Goins said she was 18 years old when she attended a party with a girlfriend at the famous Los Angeles home of Hugh Hefner.

Goins said Cosby spiked her drink with a sedative before luring her to a bedroom in the Playboy mansion where he sexually assaulted her. Goins said she wants the star to 'pay' for all the women he has allegedly attacked and is coming forward to bring them justice. Goins' lawyer has told MailOnline has already made contact with the LAPD and Goins will likely meet with detectives to give a statement in the coming days. Goins, a model and lap dancer originally from San Diego but currently working in Las Vegas, says she felt compelled to come forward to add her voice to the dozens of women who have already made allegations against Cosby, 78. Goins said reading some of the victim's accounts in the media brought back the chilling memories of that night. Goins admits she was in a daze when she came around in the bedroom but says she is sure that the man molesting her was comedy legend Bill Cosby. Goins said she hadn't been drinking that night other than the vodka drink Cosby had given her. She also said she had not taken any kind of drugs or medication that night. 'Someone spiked my drink, I have no doubt about that, it was my first drink of the night,' she said. After Cosby left the room Goins picked herself off the bed and got dressed. 'I found my dress but I couldn't find my panties anywhere, I don't know if he had them or not. I just got out of there as fast as I could and found my girlfriend downstairs. She looked at me and said I didn't seem right so she was like, 'let's go'. I think she could tell something was wrong.

On one hand, he was a skilled military commander who played a key role in Israel's wars, including the 1973 war and the invasion of Lebanon. However, his actions also led to significant human suffering and loss of life, including the Sabra and Shatila massacres, in which thousands of Palestinian and Lebanese civilians were killed. Sharon's later years saw a shift towards a more conciliatory approach, as he began to advocate for a two-state solution and withdrew Israeli troops from Gaza. Despite this, his legacy remains contentious, with many viewing him as a war criminal and others seeing him as a peacemaker. The Israeli media's hagiographic coverage of Sharon's death, which glossed over his role in the massacres and other atrocities, is particularly noteworthy. In contrast, Henry Kissinger's op-ed provides a more nuanced view of Sharon's life and legacy, highlighting his transformation from a warrior to a peacemaker and his efforts to bridge the gap between physical and political security. Kissinger's piece also emphasizes the importance of recognizing Israel's existence and the need for its neighbors to accept it as a precondition for peaceful coexistence. Overall, the two passages provide a complex and multifaceted view of Ariel Sharon's legacy, highlighting both his achievements and his flaws. The key evidence presented in the passages includes Sharon's role in the Sabra and Shatila massacres, his later efforts to advocate for a two-state solution, and the Israeli media's coverage of his death.

But Snowden apparently never boarded, reports Business Insider via an article with this headline: \"Russia Just Punked a Bunch of Journalists Who Are Now On Their Way to Havana.\" AP Moscow correspondent Max Seddon confirmed that there was no sign of Snowden, tweeting, \"Cuba here we come. Taxiing down Sheremetevo runway and no sign of Snowden. Seats empty still by 17A.\" How did Snowden get out of Hong Kong yesterday to begin with? Despite the Chinese territory's autonomy, the final decision came from Beijing, sources tell the New York Times. The move lets China save face while avoiding a drawn-out extradition battle. Some legal experts are telling the New York Times the US government goofed in waiting until Saturday to revoke Snowden's passport, though charges were filed June 14. Says a former federal prosecutor, \"They missed an opportunity to freeze him in place.\" Still, the Times notes that Snowden may have still been able to fly to Moscow sans passport thanks to special refugee travel documents from Ecuador that WikiLeaks helped Snowden obtain."], "length": 5847}

Monis's actions were described as a \"desperate and outrageous\" act by his former lawyer, Manny Conditsis, who stated that Monis was an isolated figure who had acted alone. The siege resulted in the deaths of two hostages and the gunman, and it was not linked to any organized terrorist group. The Australian government has launched an investigation into the siege and the events leading up to it, including how Monis was able to obtain a gun and why he was not on the country's terror watch list.

The country's High Court rejected his application to hear a fresh constitutional challenge to the charges against him, for which he was sentenced to 300 hours of community service.

{"pred": " \nA new study by Pecan Street Research Institute suggests that solar panels facing west may be more effective than those facing south in generating electricity, especially during peak demand hours. The study analyzed 50 homes in Austin, Texas, and found that west-facing solar panels produced 2% more electricity in a day and 49% more electricity during peak demand hours of 3-7 pm compared to south-facing panels. This is because west-facing panels capture solar energy late in the afternoon, which coincides with the time when most people return home from work and turn on their air conditioning, increasing electricity demand. The study's findings have the potential to change the residential solar market, making it more accessible to homeowners with west-facing roofs. The study's results are consistent with a previous study by the California Public Utility Commission, which found that west-facing systems were more effective at offsetting peak load than south-facing ones. However, the study's findings may not be applicable to all regions, as the structure of incentives provided by utility companies and the local climate can affect the performance of solar panels. Overall, the study highlights the importance of testing solar panel performance in practice rather than relying on conventional wisdom. The study's results also suggest that utility companies may need to rethink their opposition to west-facing panels, as they can provide more benefits to both homeowners and the grid. The study's findings have the potential to improve the efficiency of solar installations and reduce the stress on utility grids during peak demand hours.

The Syrian government has denied carrying out killings or torture among those captured, while Russia said rebels had \"kept over 100,000 people in east Aleppo as human shields.\" The evacuation plan was the culmination of two weeks of rapid advances by the Syrian army and its allies, which drove insurgents back into an ever-smaller pocket of the city under intense air strikes and artillery fire.

A presidential directive signed by President Barack Obama last year calls for government cyber tools to be integrated with the full array of national security tools. The directive, which was declassified in January, establishes principles and processes for the use of cyber operations, enabling the government to be flexible while exercising restraint in dealing with threats. The administration has also acknowledged that it has been secretly seizing phone records from millions of Americans and scouring U.S. Internet data for evidence of potential terrorist plotting. President Obama defended the counterterrorism measures, noting that they are authorized and reviewed by Congress. The administration's actions have heightened fears over the increasing militarization of the internet. Meanwhile, President Obama has ordered his senior national security and intelligence officials to draw up a list of potential overseas targets for US cyber-attacks. The directive, which was obtained by the Guardian, states that the government will identify potential targets of national importance where cyber operations can offer a favorable balance of effectiveness and risk. The administration has also emphasized that all cyber-operations must be conducted in accordance with US law and only as a complement to diplomatic and military options. President Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping met at the Sunnylands estate in California, where they made broad commitments to work together on cybersecurity and to improve military-to-military relations. The two leaders also discussed trade and the environment, and Mr. Xi invited President Obama to visit China for a similar summit. The meeting was seen as an opportunity for the two leaders to forge a personal rapport and reverse a downward spiral in relations that many analysts fear could lead to conflict. The summit was also seen as a test of Mr. Xi's ability to demonstrate a rapport with Mr. Obama and entice the U.S. to reciprocate his overtures. The meeting was seen as a historic victory for Mr. Xi's \"new-type great power\" initiative, which aims to prevent military conflict between a rising power and an established one. The two leaders also discussed North Korea's nuclear program and China's maritime disputes in Asia. The meeting was seen as a significant step towards improving relations between the two countries, but analysts noted that there were still many challenges to be overcome.

The incidents were reported to have occurred when employees were distracted or not paying attention to their surroundings. Apple was warned by local government officials about the potential issue, but the company discouraged employees from using ad hoc solutions to mark doors with post-it notes. The Apple Park design prioritized aesthetics and form over safety, with a focus on allowing staff to move quickly and without distractions. The injuries were minor, but the incidents highlight the potential risks of the campus design. The 911 call records provide evidence of the incidents, with dispatchers providing instructions to Apple security staff on how to handle the situations. The unique point made in the passages is that Apple’s focus on aesthetics and form may have contributed to the injuries, highlighting the importance of balancing design with safety considerations. The key evidence presented includes the 911 call records and the warnings from local government officials.

He and his co-author, Konstantin Batygin, believe they have compiled the best evidence for a true ninth planet to take Pluto's place in the history books. The ninth planet, dubbed \"Planet Nine,\" is thought to be almost as big as Neptune and orbiting billions of miles beyond Neptune's path. Scientists say they have solid evidence for Planet X, a true ninth planet on the fringes of our solar system, based on mathematical and computer modeling. The discovery of Planet Nine would reconfigure the models of the solar system, and Brown believes it's probably an icy, rocky world with a small envelope of gas. The existence of a hidden planet larger than Earth is intriguing, but for now, it's difficult to say too much about the hypothetical conditions there. Brown and Batygin hope their paper's publication will infuse the search with new energy, and they estimate the odds of Planet Nine being real as \"maybe 90 percent.\" The two know they may not get credit for that discovery, but they are providing treasure maps and clues for others to find the planet. The \"Pluto killer\" added that Planet Nine is forcing any objects that cross its orbit to push into these misaligned positions, fitting the concept of a planet perfectly. The discovery of Planet Nine would be evaluated by the same criteria that got Pluto demoted, but Brown isn't concerned about that, saying it's definitely a planet.

Sources tell the Wall Street Journal that the document was prepared by Christopher Steele, a former Russia expert in Britain's spy service who founded the Orbis Business Intelligence research firm in 2009. The New York Times, in a look at how the dossier came to light, reports that Steele was hired by Washington research firm Fusion GPS, which was hired by a wealthy GOP donor in the fall of 2015 to compile anti-Trump material. After Trump became the presumptive nominee, the GOP donor no longer needed the research firm's services, but wealthy Democratic donors stepped in, and Steele continued to send monthly memos detailing alleged Russian efforts to both compromise Trump and assist his campaign, per the Times' sources. In other coverage: The Guardian looks at John McCain's involvement, which apparently included clandestine efforts to obtain the dossier after hearing about it from a diplomat during a conference in Canada. \"Upon examination of the contents, and unable to make a judgment about their accuracy, I delivered the information to the director of the FBI,\" McCain said in a statement Wednesday. The AP reports that it has been unable to contact Steele. A neighbor of the former spy, who lives outside London, says Steele and his family are away and it's not clear when they will return.

He said he spoke with Trump and expressed dismay at the \"extremely corrosive\" leaks in the press. Early Thursday, Trump tweeted that Clapper had called him \"to denounce the false and fictitious report that was illegally circulated.\" He added: \"Made up, phony facts.Too bad!\" Politico looks at how Democrats are dealing with Trump's Russia troubles. So far, senators have been more restrained than House members, some of whom have started referring to Trump as \"Moscow Donald.\" The New York Times reports that Trump is facing a backlash from Jewish groups for wondering if we \"are living in Nazi Germany\" when he was criticizing intelligence agencies' handling of what he called \"fake news.\" At the Intercept, Glenn Greenwald calls the dossier \"farcical\" and warns that this episode could backfire badly for Democratic operatives and others treating the dossier as gospel.

{"pred": " \nThe Hyperloop, a proposed high-speed transportation system, has been gaining attention in recent years. However, several concerns have been raised about its feasibility, including the potential for passengers to experience nausea and discomfort due to the high speeds and frequent acceleration and deceleration. According to Passage 1, the Hyperloop's speed of 750 miles per hour would be too fast for most people, and the system would need to slow down to around 240 miles per hour to make it more comfortable for passengers. Passage 2 reports on the first public demo of the Hyperloop, where a startup called Hyperloop One tested its propulsion mechanism, but the test focused on the propulsion technology rather than the speed. Passage 3 discusses the levitation system used by Hyperloop Transportation Technologies, which uses a passive magnetic levitation system to lift the pod before applying a thrust force to accelerate it to high speeds. Passage 4 highlights the competition between Hyperloop Transportation Technologies and Hyperloop Technologies Inc. to develop the best Hyperloop system, with both companies showcasing their prototypes in the desert north of Las Vegas. Passage 5 reports on the successful test of Hyperloop One's linear induction propulsion system, which achieved a speed of 115 miles per hour. Passage 6 emphasizes the challenges of building a Hyperloop system, including land rights and bureaucratic obstacles, and questions whether the Hyperloop can be built without putting it underground or out in the ocean. Passage 7 introduces a browser game called Break-a-Pod, which simulates the experience of riding in a Hyperloop pod and aims to make the concept more accessible and fun for a wider audience. Passage 8 is not relevant to the topic of the Hyperloop. Overall, while the Hyperloop has the potential to revolutionize transportation, several challenges and concerns need to be addressed before it can become a reality. The development of the Hyperloop system is ongoing, with several companies competing to develop the best system, but the challenges of building and implementing the system are significant. The Hyperloop's feasibility and potential impact on transportation will depend on the ability of companies to overcome these challenges and develop a safe, comfortable, and efficient system. \n\nNote: The summary is a few sentences longer than the requested one-page summary, but it is still concise and focuses on the most important information from the passages.

The women had in vitro fertilization before the transplants, using their own eggs to make embryos. Dr. Brannstrom predicts that three or four of the seven women might successfully give birth, while one or two might get pregnant and miscarry, and one or two might not be able to get pregnant.

The transplanted wombs will be removed after a maximum of two pregnancies. This research is a world first, with previous womb transplants in Turkey and Saudi Arabia failing to produce babies. The technique is controversial because Dr. Brannstrom is accepting wombs donated by living women, who are relatives or friends of his patients.

The team found artefacts made of copper alloy, which were not consistent with the Santa Maria's iron and/or wood fixations. In contrast, a US marine archaeologist, Barry Clifford, had previously believed that the wreck was the Santa Maria, based on geographical and underwater topography evidence. However, Unesco's experts argue that the site is further away from shore than expected and that the fasteners found at the site are from a later ship. Meanwhile, Unesco plans to search for the Santa Maria in other locations, including coastal marshland, based on an edited version of Columbus's diary. The search has been criticized by scholars, who argue that the Santa Maria could not have reached the marshland due to shallow reefs. A US underwater archaeologist, Professor Charles Beeker, has been refused permission to continue his investigation of the site, and Unesco has instead partnered with a European team. The debate highlights the challenges of underwater archaeology and the importance of thorough investigation and evidence-based conclusions. The search for the Santa Maria has also sparked renewed international interest in finding Columbus's lost flagship, which represents a significant event in world history.

Passage 1 highlights the importance of location information in tweets, but it is not directly related to the controversy. Passage 2 discusses the dangers of the \"Deep State\" and how it is using classic Cold War tactics to undermine Trump's presidency. The author argues that the CIA and its allies are using the media to spread unsubstantiated claims and allegations against Trump, and that this is a threat to democracy. Passage 3 reports on the growing concern among Democrats about Trump's legitimacy as president-elect, citing Russia's alleged interference in the election and Trump's refusal to acknowledge it. The article notes that some Democrats are hesitant to question Trump's legitimacy, but others are calling for a full investigation into the matter. Passage 4 criticizes Trump for trivializing the Holocaust by comparing it to the controversy surrounding his ties with Russia. The author argues that Trump's comment was insensitive and coarsens the discourse. Passage 5 and Passage 6 discuss the origins of the unverified dossier on Trump's ties with Russia, which was prepared by a former British intelligence officer, Christopher Steele. The dossier contains allegations of Trump's connections with Russian oligarchs and his potential susceptibility to blackmail. Passage 7 provides a detailed account of how the dossier was compiled and how it was passed to the FBI and other officials. The article notes that the dossier was initially commissioned by a Republican opponent of Trump, but was later taken up by a Democratic client. The author argues that the dossier's contents are alarming and that they should be investigated further. Overall, the selected passages highlight the controversy surrounding Trump's ties with Russia and the concerns about his legitimacy as president-elect.

The study, published in PLoS One, used static facial photographs of 80 students and found that raters were able to estimate intelligence with an accuracy higher than chance from photos of men, but not women. The researchers proposed several explanations for this difference, including the possibility that cues of higher intelligence are sexually dimorphic and apparent only in men's faces, or that women are judged according to their attractiveness, which may prevent an accurate assessment of their intelligence. The study also found that people tend to associate certain facial traits with high intelligence, such as a longer face, wider distance between the eyes, and a sharper chin, but these traits do not actually correlate with real intelligence. The researchers suggest that these notions represent a cultural stereotype, but some unidentified visual cues may point to a person's intelligence. The study used geometric morphometrics to analyze the facial features of 40 men and 40 women and found that the perception of intelligence was associated with certain facial traits, but not with actual intelligence. The researchers also found that fluid intelligence and figural intelligence were significantly associated with perceived intelligence from men's faces, but not women's faces. Overall, the study suggests that people's ability to estimate intelligence from facial photographs is not based on facial shape, but rather on a combination of facial features. The study's findings have important implications for our understanding of human social interaction and evolution. The researchers propose that the ability to accurately assess intelligence may have evolved as a way to select a mate with good genes, and that this ability may be more important for men than women.

{"pred": " \nThe U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has conducted an exhaustive study of the CIA's detention and interrogation program, which has been criticized for its use of waterboarding and harsh interrogation techniques. Mark Udall, a committee member, has urged President Obama to publicly support the fullest declassification possible of the report, arguing that anything less will not set the record straight on this dark chapter of the CIA's history. The CIA has been accused of monitoring Senate computers in possible violation of an agreement, which may have been a criminal act. The CIA and the committee are engaged in a bitter struggle over the release of the report, with the CIA resisting surrendering top-secret documents that the agency asserts are covered by executive privilege. The report details how the CIA misled the Bush administration and Congress about the use of interrogation techniques, and how the techniques did not provide the intelligence that led to the killing of Osama bin Laden. The conflict over the report has heightened, with the committee discovering that a CIA internal review confirming some of the committee's findings had been withheld from Senate investigators. The CIA has downplayed the importance of the internal review, but Udall has called for its release, arguing that it is vital to understand how and why the content of the internal review contradicts the CIA's official response to the committee. The White House has made clear that a summary of the report's findings and conclusions should be declassified, but the CIA has resisted, leading to a breakdown in relations between the CIA and its congressional overseers. The conflict has raised questions about the CIA's control over the release of the report and the role of the White House in declassifying the document. The CIA's actions have been criticized for posing impediments to the committee's oversight responsibilities and for undermining the separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches. The conflict has also raised concerns about the CIA's use of executive privilege to withhold documents from the committee. The CIA's monitoring of Senate computers has been criticized as a possible violation of the law, and the agency's actions have been described as \"incredibly troubling\" for the committee's oversight responsibilities and for democracy. The conflict over the report has highlighted the need for greater transparency and accountability in the CIA's operations. The CIA's actions have been criticized for undermining the committee's ability to do its oversight work, and the agency's use of executive privilege has been described as a \"poison pill\" that could undermine the committee's ability to conduct effective oversight.

The committee believes the CIA monitored those computers, despite a specific agreement not to, according to McClatchy sources.

According to the California Attorney General's database, there are 35 people listed as missing in the county, including men, women, and children.

However, an analysis of the data by the Journal found that the county's rate of missing persons is not as high as previously thought, and that many of the missing persons cases are resolved within days or weeks. The Journal also found that some people are reported missing multiple times, and that the county's high rate of missing persons may be due in part to the fact that California has a liberal standard for filing a missing persons report.

The government has detained and deported such refugees to North Korea, where they may face severe punishment, even death, including in North Korean forced labor camps. The State Department’s 2016 Trafficking in Persons Report noted that North Korean women and girls are subjected to sexual slavery by Chinese or Korean-Chinese men, forced prostitution in brothels or through Internet sex sites, or compelled service as hostesses in nightclubs or karaoke bars.

Intelligence chiefs are defending their decision to take the very unusual step of attaching a summary of the unverified dossier to last week's briefing on Russian hacking, the Washington Post reports. \"Part of our obligation is to ensure that policymakers are provided with the fullest possible picture of any matters that might affect national security,\" Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Wednesday. He said he spoke with Trump and expressed dismay at the \"extremely corrosive\" leaks in the press. Early Thursday, Trump tweeted that Clapper had called him \"to denounce the false and fictitious report that was illegally circulated.\" He added: \"Made up, phony facts.Too bad!\" Politico looks at how Democrats are dealing with Trump's Russia troubles. So far, senators have been more restrained than House members, some of whom have started referring to Trump as \"Moscow Donald.\" The New York Times reports that Trump is facing a backlash from Jewish groups for wondering if we \"are living in Nazi Germany\" when he was criticizing intelligence agencies' handling of what he called \"fake news.\" At the Intercept, Glenn Greenwald calls the dossier \"farcical\" and warns that this episode could backfire badly for Democratic operatives and others treating the dossier as gospel. He warns that if it is proved false, it will \"forever discredit ... future journalistic exposés that are based on actual, corroborated wrongdoing.\""], "length": 6932}
{"pred": " \nA vegan mother, Sarah Markham, was arrested in June for refusing to take her dehydrated newborn to the hospital. She believed that the formula provided by the doctor contained animal by-products and wanted to try a soy-based formula from Whole Foods instead. The police found the baby in a dehydrated state and took him into state custody. However, in a later court hearing, the judge ruled in favor of Markham, stating that there was no evidence of abuse or neglect, and the baby was returned to her care. The baby is now thriving on a soy formula and weighs 17 pounds. The case highlights the challenges of balancing a mother's dietary choices with the need to ensure the health and well-being of her child. The incident also raises questions about the role of the state in intervening in family decisions and the limits of parental autonomy. The judge's decision suggests that the state should not intervene in family decisions unless there is clear evidence of harm or neglect. The case has sparked debate about the rights of parents to make choices about their children's care and the responsibilities of the state to protect vulnerable children. The incident also highlights the importance of considering the cultural and personal values of parents when making decisions about their children's care. The judge's decision has been seen as a victory for Markham and her right to make choices about her child's care, but it also raises questions about the potential consequences of such decisions on the child's health and well-being.

The strange case began in June when police in Casselberry charged Sarah Markham with neglect and took away 2-week-old Caleb. The charges came after a pediatrician diagnosed Caleb as dehydrated and underweight, and told Markham to take him to the hospital immediately, recounts WKMG. Instead, Markham bought soy formula to supplement her breast milk. When she didn't show up at the hospital, police came to her house, and she told them she wanted a second doctor's opinion and stressed that she did not want her son getting formula from animal products. Today, a Seminole County judge granted her custody again with the provision that she provide a nutritionist's report in 10 days. \"There's no case, there's no abuse, there's no neglect—there's simply a doctor who has been challenged by a mother, and he didn't like it,\" says Caleb's grandfather, Bo Markham. The child has been with his grandparents since he was taken out of his mother's care, and now weighs about 17 pounds. \"He's still on a soy formula,\" says Bo Markham. The criminal neglect charges are still pending, though Sarah Markham's attorney—Mark O'Mara, who defended George Zimmerman—says he expects they will be dismissed now.

The women, who are often desperate for money, are forced to engage in this work to survive, with some earning as little as $3 per day. A 30-year-old woman named Suh, who fled North Korea in 2008, was forced to do video chatting after her husband's construction earnings couldn't support their family. She earned $120 in her best week, but eventually decided to leave the work and escape to Laos with her 18-month-old daughter. Suh's story is not unique, as many North Korean women are being trafficked and forced into sex work in China. According to the State Department's 2016 Trafficking in Persons Report, North Korean women and girls are subjected to sexual slavery, forced prostitution, and other forms of exploitation. The Chinese government has been criticized for not doing enough to prevent human trafficking and protect North Korean women. A group of female North Korean workers was recently deported from China after it was discovered that they were being forced into prostitution by their overseer. The women had been working at a food factory in Liaoning province, but were leaving their compound at night to engage in illegal activities, including prostitution. The Chinese government has been accused of not doing enough to prevent human trafficking and protect North Korean women. The situation is complex, with many North Korean women being forced into sex work due to desperation and lack of options. The Chinese government's treatment of North Korean women has been criticized, with some being deported back to North Korea where they may face severe punishment. The situation highlights the need for greater international cooperation to prevent human trafficking and protect vulnerable populations. The United States has accepted 74 refugees from North Korea since Kim Jong Un took power, but the process of seeking asylum can be lengthy and challenging. Suh has applied for asylum in the United States, but faces an uncertain future.

And this is only her most recent travail: Suh and two other women interviewed by the Post were trying to flee their lives as sex \"video chatters\" in China, an online profession many women are sucked into after first escaping North Korea—either by willingly getting sold to Chinese men to get out of their home country, or after being tricked into thinking they were being hired for jobs in China, only to end up as human trafficking victims. Purchasing North Korean women is big business in China for men who can't find wives any other way: The asking price for women between 15 and 25 can near $12,000. Life in China is impoverished and dangerous for these North Korean nationals: They can be deported back to their home country if they're caught, per Radio Free Asia. North Korean women trying to survive there often fall into the online \"video chatting\" business, allowing them to bring in some extra cash from the safety of their own homes. But it's a demeaning, demoralizing trade. \"I felt so disgusting,\" Suh says. And it's what led Suh (who brought her 18-month-old daughter with her, but had to leave her 5-year-old daughter behind) and the two other women to try to escape once more—this time to Laos, then to Thailand, where they wouldn't have been able to be repatriated back to North Korea.

{"pred": " \nFederal Court Justice Robin Camp resigned after the Canadian Judicial Council (CJC) recommended his removal from the bench. The CJC found that Camp's comments during a 2014 sexual assault trial, including asking the complainant why she didn't keep her \"knees together,\" were \"so manifestly and profoundly destructive of the concept of impartiality, integrity and independence of the judicial role.\" Camp had apologized for his comments and undergone counseling, but the CJC deemed his actions insufficient to maintain public confidence in the justice system. Camp's resignation was seen as a positive step towards addressing the issue of gender bias in the justice system, with some experts calling it a \"watershed moment.\" The incident highlighted the need for mandatory judicial training on gendered issues, including sexual assault, domestic violence, and sexual harassment. The Canadian government has introduced legislation to require better training for judges in handling sexual assault cases, and the justice minister agreed that judges need to be properly trained. The case also drew attention to the ongoing issue of rape myths and stereotypes in the justice system, with some experts arguing that the system remains mired in 19th-century stereotypes about women. The acquittal of a taxi driver in Halifax who was accused of sexually assaulting a passenger who was so intoxicated that she passed out was seen as another example of the need for better training and education on these issues. Overall, the incident and the subsequent resignation of Justice Camp highlighted the need for greater awareness and education on gender bias and rape myths in the justice system.  The Canadian government's efforts to address these issues through legislation and training programs were seen as a positive step towards creating a more just and equitable system.
