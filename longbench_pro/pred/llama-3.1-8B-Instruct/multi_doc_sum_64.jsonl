{"pred": "Steven Spielberg's The BFG has been a commercial disappointment, earning only $22.2 million in its opening weekend, despite a $140 million budget. The film's poor performance can be attributed to several factors, including its lack of a clear marketing strategy, the mixed reviews from critics, and the competition from other summer blockbusters. The film's failure to resonate with audiences can be seen as a generational issue, as the book's core fanbase is currently in their mid-to-late twenties and early thirties, a demographic that may not be as familiar with the book. The film's failure is also a reflection of Spielberg's changing focus towards more prestige films, such as Lincoln and Bridge of Spies, which may not appeal to the same audience as his earlier work. The BFG's poor performance is a significant setback for Disney, which had high hopes for the film's success. The film's failure to connect with audiences is a reminder that even the most well-known and respected directors can have a commercial misfire.\n\nThe BFG's poor performance is not an isolated incident, as other films have also struggled to connect with audiences in recent years.

That's left people wondering if the man who essentially invented the summer blockbuster with Jaws has lost his summertime feeling. Here's what some of the experts are saying: Slash Film argues you can't blame Spielberg for the failure, as he's far from the first director to flop when adapting a story by Roald Dahl. In fact, only one film based on a Dahl book—Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory—has made more than $34 million in US theaters. The Wrap has a list of seven reasons The BFG bombed, from \"Roald Dahl is no JK Rowling\" to a lack of stars and a confusing title. The BFG might be proof it's time for Spielberg to step away from family films, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which points out the director hasn't had a hit family film since Hook a quarter of a century ago. He's had better luck with recent grown-up fare like Lincoln and Bridge of Spies. The Wall Street Journal details Spielberg's history of being able to \"bounce back\" after cinematic disappointments, something he should have a good chance of doing with his next three films currently including a historical drama, a science-fiction movie based on a popular book, and an Indiana Jones sequel. But the \"reason this stings\" is because every other time Spielberg disappointed at the box office, it was with a \"good for you\" film, according to Forbes. Whereas The BFG was intended as a money-maker for the studio. Finally, Movie Pilot argues that the failure of The BFG shouldn't count against any future Spielberg or Dahl movies. \"The main issue of the movie is more about being unremarkable than disastrous.”"], "length": 56886}

They estimate that Planet 9 is about two to four times the diameter of the Earth and orbits the sun at an average distance of 20 times that of Neptune. The researchers believe that Planet 9 is an icy, rocky world with a small envelope of gas and may have been flung into deep space by the gravitational force of Jupiter or Saturn. The discovery of Planet 9 has sparked excitement among astronomers, with some predicting that it could be discovered within a few years. However, the researchers acknowledge that the discovery of Planet 9 is still a long shot and that it may take a lot of hard work and luck to confirm its existence. Brown, who is also known for his role in the demotion of Pluto from planet status, believes that the discovery of Planet 9 could be a major breakthrough in the field of astronomy and could help to rewrite the textbooks on the solar system. He notes that the discovery of Planet 9 is not just about finding a new planet, but also about understanding the history and evolution of the solar system. Brown's daughter had suggested that he find a new planet to replace Pluto, and he believes that he has done just that. The discovery of Planet 9 has also sparked debate among astronomers about the definition of a planet and whether Planet 9 meets the criteria set by the International Astronomical Union. Some astronomers have questioned the existence of Planet 9, citing the lack of direct evidence and the possibility of alternative explanations for the observed motion of the small bodies in the outer solar system. However, Brown and Batygin believe that their research provides strong evidence for the existence of Planet 9 and that it is a major discovery that could change our understanding of the solar system.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes.

The author notes that they were not motivated by health or environmental concerns, but rather a desire to avoid meat. They also mention that they were not a good vegetarian, as they did not like vegetables and mostly ate pasta and cheese.\n\nPassage 3 discusses a study by the Humane Research Council on the phenomenon of lapsed vegetarians. The study found that only 2% of the US population is currently vegetarian or vegan, but 10% of the population has previously been vegetarian or vegan. The study suggests that getting people to reduce their meat and dairy intake may be more effective than demanding complete elimination of animal products. The study also found that most former vegetarians transitioned to a veg diet in a few days or weeks, and that a third of people abandoned their animal-free diets in three months or less.\n\nPassage 6 presents the findings of a study on the factors that influence people's decisions to adopt or give up a vegetarian or vegan diet. The study found that current vegetarians/vegans have a wide range of motivations that keep them veg, which may mean that more diverse messaging and outreach could have a positive impact. The study also shows that lapsed vegetarians/vegans have some common characteristics, such as transitioning to the diet too quickly, not being involved socially with other veg folks, and not being able to address certain food cravings.

{"pred": "The recent legal developments in the United States suggest that the liability of distracted driving accidents may be expanding to include not only the driver but also the person who sent the text message. In a recent case in Pennsylvania, a judge ruled that two men who texted a driver at the time of a fatal accident could be held accountable, citing a 2013 New Jersey appeals court ruling that established a similar cause of action. The court held that the sender of a text message can potentially be liable if an accident is caused by texting, but only if the sender knew or had special reason to know that the recipient would view the text while driving and thus be distracted. The court also emphasized that a special relationship between the sender and the driver is required for liability, and that mere knowledge of the driver's driving status is not enough. The ruling does not mean that the two men are definitely liable, but rather that the lawsuit against them can continue. The development is seen as a significant shift in the legal system's approach to distracted driving, which may help to accelerate a change in public attitudes towards the issue. The case is part of a growing trend of lawsuits against technology companies, including a recent lawsuit against Snapchat for its speed-measuring feature. The New York state legislature has also proposed a \"textalyzer\" bill that would allow police to test cell phones to identify distracted drivers. The bill is seen as a way to crack down on distracted driving and to hold technology companies accountable for their role in the problem.

In neither case has anyone (yet) had to legally assume this burden: In the 2013 New Jersey appellate case, the \"remote texter\" was let off the hook because there wasn't enough evidence to show she knew her friend—who severely injured two people after slamming into their motorcycle—was driving when she texted him, the ABA Journal reports. And in the Pennsylvania case, the judge's ruling didn't hold responsible the two texters who were sending messages to the driver when she crashed into a motorcycle, killing that driver—it was simply determined the texters were fair game for the suit, per the Legal Intelligencer. But the fact that holding non-driving texters liable for car crashes is even being considered is starting to slowly impact the legal landscape on distracted driving. The New Jersey and Pennsylvania cases underscore the challenges in such cases. For instance, it's not enough to hold a texter liable simply because he or she texted a driver: Certain conditions must be met, such as knowing (or having good reason to believe) the driver would pick up the phone to check out texts while driving, as well as proving a \"special relationship\" exists between texter and recipient to influence the recipient picking up.

This discrepancy could challenge some of the basic precepts surrounding the functioning of our universe, and may be due to unknown subatomic particles, dark energy, or an incomplete understanding of Einstein's theory of relativity. The new data were gleaned by analyzing two types of star: Cepheid stars and Type la supernovae, which allowed astronomers to determine the true brightness of the Type la supernovae and calculate the distance to some 300 Type la supernovae in distant galaxies. The researchers measured about 2,400 Cepheid stars occupying 19 nearby galaxies, compared the apparent brightness of both types of star, and were able to determine the true brightness of the Type la supernovae. The new numbers indicate that space is expanding fast enough to essentially double the distance between our galaxy and our nearest neighbors in about 10 billion years. The discovery presents a problem for cosmologists, as it does not match estimated expansion rates from the energetic leftovers of the Big Bang. The discrepancy still needs to be independently verified, but if it holds up, it implies that there are underlying physical processes pushing space apart which we haven’t fully accounted for. The universe is made up of 95% dark energy, dark matter, and dark radiation, all of which emit no light and are barely understood at all.

{"pred": "The liability of individuals who send text messages to drivers who are involved in accidents has been a topic of discussion in recent court rulings. In Pennsylvania, a judge ruled that two men who texted a driver before a fatal accident could be held liable for the accident, even if they did not know the driver was driving at the time. The court's decision was based on the idea that if the texter knew or had reason to believe the driver was driving, they could be held responsible for the accident. This ruling was influenced by a 2013 New Jersey appellate ruling that established that third parties who text drivers can be liable for accidents caused by the driver's distraction. The court in the Pennsylvania case noted that the sender of a text message can potentially be liable if an accident is caused by texting, but only if the sender knew or had special reason to know that the recipient would view the text while driving and thus be distracted. The court also emphasized that the sender's liability would depend on the specific circumstances of the case, including whether the sender knew the driver was driving and whether the driver was actively encouraged to text while driving. In a related case, a New Jersey appeals court ruled that a 17-year-old girl who texted a driver before a fatal accident could not be held liable for the accident, as there was no evidence that she knew the driver was driving at the time. The court noted that the sender of a text message has a duty not to text someone who is driving if the texter knows or has special reason to know that the recipient will view the text while driving. However, the court concluded that the girl had not breached this duty, as there was no evidence that she knew the driver was driving or that she had actively encouraged him to text while driving. The court also emphasized that the sender's liability would depend on the specific circumstances of the case, including whether the sender knew the driver was driving and whether the driver was actively encouraged to text while driving.

In neither case has anyone (yet) had to legally assume this burden: In the 2013 New Jersey appellate case, the \"remote texter\" was let off the hook because there wasn't enough evidence to show she knew her friend—who severely injured two people after slamming into their motorcycle—was driving when she texted him, the ABA Journal reports. And in the Pennsylvania case, the judge's ruling didn't hold responsible the two texters who were sending messages to the driver when she crashed into a motorcycle, killing that driver—it was simply determined the texters were fair game for the suit, per the Legal Intelligencer. But the fact that holding non-driving texters liable for car crashes is even being considered is starting to slowly impact the legal landscape on distracted driving. The New Jersey and Pennsylvania cases underscore the challenges in such cases. For instance, it's not enough to hold a texter liable simply because he or she texted a driver: Certain conditions must be met, such as knowing (or having good reason to believe) the driver would pick up the phone to check out texts while driving, as well as proving a \"special relationship\" exists between texter and recipient to influence the recipient picking up. But these kinds of cases, as well as other proposed crackdowns on car texters (including New York's controversial \"textalyzer\" bill), show the issue is being given heavier weight. \"People often see distracted driving as a socially acceptable sin … an innocuous guilty pleasure in which everyone indulges,\" a University of South Carolina law professor tells Vocativ. \"The same used to be true of drunk driving ...

Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times.

Andrew Cuomo calls \"obviously an act of terrorism\"—and the device that exploded before a New Jersey race to benefit Marines and sailors early Saturday. It's not clear whether a trigger was found with the Elizabeth devices. Bollwage says he's not sure his city was targeted. He suspects somebody may have just dumped the devices in Elizabeth, but he is \"extremely concerned for everyone in the state and country where someone can just go and drop a backpack into a garbage can that has multiple explosives in it with no timers and then you have to wonder how many people could have been hurt.\" An official close to the investigation tells Reuters that all the devices involved have been crude and the level of planning appears low—but some investigators fear this was just a test. \"That's what worries us,\" he says. \"Was this some kind of test run, not just of the devices, but also of the surveillance in New York and the response?\" (The FBI says it is questioning five people found in a \"vehicle of interest.\")"], "length": 52644}

However, the sardine population is in decline, which will have a ripple effect on dozens of species that rely on them for food. The Pacific Fishery Management Council should set conservative catch limits on sardines and fulfill its commitment to prohibit unregulated fishing on forage fish species. The decline of sardines is a natural fluctuation, but it's also possible that overfishing is a contributing factor. Scientists have identified a naturally occurring climate cycle, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which has brought cold, nutrient-rich water to the West Coast, repelling sardines. The sardine population has dropped 72% since its last peak in 2006, and spawning has taken a dive. Federal fishery managers have slashed harvest limits by more than two-thirds, but some environmental groups argue that the catch should be halted outright. The sardine fishing industry is struggling, with many boats returning to port without a single fish. The decline of sardines is a concern for the entire ecosystem, as they are a crucial food source for many species.

One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing.

Damon has suggested that there is a spectrum of behavior, with some forms of misconduct being more serious than others. However, many have argued that this approach is problematic, as it can be used to downplay the severity of certain behaviors.

The investigation, led by Ted Wells, relied heavily on assumptions and uncertain information, which led to a biased and inaccurate report. The Wells Report concluded that Tom Brady was \"at least generally aware\" of the deflation scheme, but this conclusion was based on ambiguous texts and a lack of understanding of the Ideal Gas Law, which explains how temperature and weather conditions affect the pressure of footballs. The report also relied on the testimony of two witnesses, Jim McNally and John Jastremski, who were accused of deflating the footballs, but their texts and behavior were misinterpreted by the investigators. The Patriots have since launched a counterattack, publishing a 20,000-word rebuttal that challenges the Wells Report's findings and presents alternative explanations for the deflation of the footballs. The rebuttal, written by Daniel L. Goldberg, a Patriots lawyer, argues that the investigation was flawed and that the conclusions were based on incomplete and incorrect information. The rebuttal also presents evidence that the Colts' footballs were also under-inflated during the game, which contradicts the Wells Report's conclusion that the Patriots were the only team to deflate their footballs. The rebuttal concludes that the investigation was a \"Kafkaesque injustice\" and that the Wells Report's findings are \"at best, incomplete, incorrect, and lack context.\" The NFL has since fined the Patriots $1 million and docked two draft picks, but the team has maintained its innocence and continues to dispute the findings of the Wells Report.

The Clarion nightsnake was found again on one of the Revillagigedo Islands, more than 400 miles off Mexico's Pacific coast. The original spotting of the species was made by American naturalist William Beebe in 1936, but subsequent visits failed to find more nightsnakes, and no further sightings were reported over the years. Researchers Daniel Mulcahy and Juan Martinez Gomez of Mexico's Ecology Institute set out to find the snake, using Beebe's original field notes as a guide. They timed their expedition to replicate Beebe's steps and used the island's changing seasons to their advantage. The researchers performed DNA analysis to establish the long, dark spotted snake as its own species and found that it is most closely related to snakes from Mexico's Sonora-Sinaloa coast. The snake's ancestors may have made the trip from the mainland on a tree trunk felled by a storm and washed out to sea. The re-discovery of the Clarion nightsnake is significant because of the fragility of island ecosystems.

The pay gap has risen dramatically since the 1990s, with some fluctuations. The report attributes the rise in CEO pay to the stock-related components of compensation, such as stock awards and realized stock options. The value of exercised stock options accounted for 78.9% of the year-over-year growth in CEO compensation from 2016 to 2017, growing by 47.1%. The CEO-to-worker compensation ratio has increased significantly over the years, with the ratio peaking at 344-to-1 in 2000 and 361-to-1 in 2000 when measured by stock options granted. The report concludes that the dramatic rise in CEO compensation is not driven by the market for skills, but rather by managerial power and rent-seeking behavior. The authors argue that CEO pay is a nontrivial share of the denominator, and removing top CEOs' pay from the top 0.1% category would reduce the average for the broader group. The report also highlights the importance of considering the CEO-to-worker pay ratio, which has increased significantly over the years, with the ratio peaking at 312-to-1 in 2017. The authors suggest that the dramatic rise in CEO compensation is a result of economic rents, concessions that CEOs can draw from the economy not by virtue of their contribution to economic output but by virtue of their position. The report concludes that CEO pay could be reduced without affecting the economy, and that the growth of top 1 percent incomes is disproportionately driven by households headed by nonfinance executives and financial-sector workers. The authors recommend implementing higher marginal income tax rates at the top, setting corporate tax rates higher for firms with higher CEO-to-worker compensation ratios, and using \"say on pay\" to limit executive pay growth.

The CRA requires federal banking regulators to conduct examinations to assess whether a bank is meeting local credit needs. The regulators issue CRA credits, or points, where banks engage in qualifying activities, such as mortgage, consumer, and business lending, community investments, and low-cost services that benefit low- and moderate-income (LMI) areas and entities. The CRA has been debated for its effectiveness in incentivizing bank lending and investment activity to LMI customers. Some argue that the CRA may induce banks to forgo more profitable lending opportunities in nontargeted neighborhoods by encouraging a disproportionate amount of lending in LMI communities. Others argue that the CRA compels banks to make loans to higher-risk borrowers that are more likely to have repayment problems, which may compromise the financial stability of the banking system. The CRA examination process has been criticized for being subjective, with regulators determining the quality and quantity of CRA compliance. The CRA has been revised to require descriptive CRA composite performance ratings that must be disclosed to the public. The CRA has been studied by the Federal Reserve, which reported that lending to LMI families had increased since the CRA's enactment but found it was not possible to directly attribute all of that increase to the CRA.

The finding suggests the planet contains a lot more ice and a lot less rock than thought, the Christian Science Monitor reports. There are still a lot of mysteries to be solved. Scientists hope the first close-up look at Pluto's surface will explain features like heart- and doughnut-shaped features recently spotted for the first time.

The main suspect, Kenneth Brunke, was a 46-year-old man with a history of depression and a reputation for being a quiet but menacing figure. He was accused of luring Aldrich to his house with promises of free morphine and then killing her and her friends. However, the case took a dramatic turn when one of the suspects, Marietta Carlson, died in jail, and a new confession emerged from Garry Cordell, who claimed that he and Carlson had committed the murders. The prosecutor, Tim Noble, was criticized for his handling of the case, including his decision to allow Brunke to plead to reduced charges in exchange for his testimony against Cordell. The case was highly publicized, and the community was shocked by the violence and the apparent cover-up. The victims' families were outraged by the plea deal and felt that justice had not been served. The case highlighted the growing drug problem in the community and the need for more effective law enforcement. In the end, Cordell was sentenced to life in prison without parole, while Brunke was sentenced to prison on lesser felonies. The case remained a source of controversy and outrage in the community.

And Aldrich did steal a cocaine stash from Brunke's yard, which was followed by a text from Brunke ostensibly meant to lure Aldrich to come over for some free morphine. Aldrich headed to Brunke's house, along with Nelson and Hutchinson, which is where the story takes a weird turn. At first Cordell and his girlfriend, Marietta Carlson, confessed they and Brunke had killed the victims, though the stories kept changing; Brunke denied participating.

The rediscovery of the Clarion Nightsnake is an incredible story of how scientists rely on historical data and museum collections to solve modern-day mysteries about biodiversity in the world. The snake is found exclusively on the island and could have remained unknown to science if not for the team's efforts. The researchers performed DNA analysis to establish the long, dark spotted snake as its own species and see where it had come from. The tests showed it is most closely related to snakes from Mexico's Sonora-Sinaloa coast more than 500 miles away. The researchers suspect that the snake's ancestors may have made the trip from the mainland on a tree trunk felled by a storm and washed out to sea. The rediscovery of the Clarion Nightsnake is a significant finding, as it highlights the importance of preserving historical data and museum collections for future scientific research. The snake is now recognized as a full species, and the researchers plan to continue monitoring this species to learn more about the role it plays in the delicate Clarion Island ecosystem. The Clarion Nightsnake is a unique and fascinating species that has been lost to science for nearly a century, and its rediscovery is a testament to the power of scientific inquiry and the importance of preserving our natural heritage. The researchers' use of historical data and museum collections to solve the mystery of the Clarion Nightsnake's disappearance is a prime example of how scientists can use existing knowledge to make new discoveries and advance our understanding of the natural world. The rediscovery of the Clarion Nightsnake also highlights the importance of conservation efforts and the need to protect and preserve our natural resources for future generations. The snake's unique characteristics and habits make it an important part of the island's ecosystem, and its rediscovery is a significant step forward in our understanding of the natural world.

However, the European Commission and other creditors have warned that a \"no\" vote could lead to Greece leaving the eurozone. The Greek economy is already being squeezed, with banks shut and limits imposed on cash withdrawals. The head of Greece's banking association has warned that the banks will be dependent on the European Central Bank after Monday. The crisis has sparked widespread protests and scuffles with police, with both sides holding rallies in Athens. A Greek court has rejected a challenge to the legality of the referendum, and a poll published in Ethnos newspaper shows the two sides evenly split, with 44.8% voting \"yes\" and 43.4% voting \"no\". The European Commission has warned that a \"no\" vote will weaken the Greeks' position and that even a \"yes\" vote will not mean a deal is easy to agree. The Greek government has called for a 30% \"haircut\" off the debt and a 20-year grace period for the rest.

The alleged attack happened in 2008, which puts the claim within California's statute of limitations for criminal charges. Chloe Goins, the woman making the claim, said she was 18 years old when she attended a party with a girlfriend at the Playboy Mansion, where they met Cosby, who allegedly gave them drinks. Goins said she remembers waking up \"butt naked\" on a bed with Cosby hunched over her, licking her toes and pleasuring himself. Cosby's lawyer, Martin Singer, has denied the women's claims and questioned their credibility. Cosby has remained mostly silent about the allegations, though he commented in an interview that the \"black media\" should remain \"neutral\" on the charges against him.

The system uses oxygenation changes in the brain to detect \"yes\" or \"no\" responses to questions. Four patients with CLIS were trained to use the system, and their brain activity was monitored using fNIRS. The results showed that the patients were able to communicate effectively, with correct response rates above 70% over several weeks. The system was also able to detect changes in the patients' emotional state, with all four patients indicating that they were \"happy\" with life. This breakthrough has the potential to transform the lives of people with CLIS, allowing them to communicate with their loved ones and express their thoughts and feelings. The researchers plan to build on this work by developing a system that allows patients to communicate more proactively, rather than simply answering questions. This technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with people with severe brain injuries, and could lead to new treatments and therapies for patients with CLIS. The study's findings also suggest that people with CLIS may be more satisfied with their quality of life than previously thought, and that they may experience a state of meditation or heightened social awareness.

{"pred": "The liability of individuals who send text messages to drivers who are involved in accidents has been a topic of discussion in recent years. A Pennsylvania court ruling in 2013 established that third parties who are aware they are texting a distracted driver can be liable for the driver's accidents. However, the court also noted that the third parties must be aware that the driver is driving and will view the text while on the road. A recent case in Pennsylvania, Gallatin v. Gargiulo, upheld this stipulation, making it more difficult for plaintiffs to prevail in suits against third parties. The ruling has opened \"a can of worms\" for defense lawyers, as anyone who sends text messages could potentially be named as a defendant in such litigation. In New York, lawmakers have proposed a \"textalyzer\" bill that would allow police officers to take phones from drivers after accidents and determine whether they were using the phone in a way that isn't in accordance with state laws. The bill also proposes that drivers would be forced to hand over their phone after a wreck or risk a driver's license suspension. Privacy advocates have denounced the bill, citing concerns about the potential for abuse and the invasion of privacy. Meanwhile, a recent case in New Jersey established that a driver who was texting while driving was liable for an accident, and the court also found that the sender of the text message was not liable because they did not know the recipient was driving. However, the court noted that the sender could be liable if they had reason to know that the recipient would view the text while driving. The case highlights the complexities of liability in distracted driving cases and the need for clear guidelines and regulations. In a related development, a Pennsylvania judge ruled that two men who texted a driver during a fatal accident were also liable for the accident and will face negligence and wrongful-death claims. The ruling follows a New Jersey appellate ruling from 2013 establishing that third parties who are aware they are texting a distracted driver can be liable for the driver's accidents. The judge's decision sets a high bar for plaintiffs to prove that the third parties knew the driver was driving and would view the text while on the road. The ruling has significant implications for the liability of individuals who send text messages to drivers who are involved in accidents.

And in the Pennsylvania case, the judge's ruling didn't hold responsible the two texters who were sending messages to the driver when she crashed into a motorcycle, killing that driver—it was simply determined the texters were fair game for the suit, per the Legal Intelligencer. But the fact that holding non-driving texters liable for car crashes is even being considered is starting to slowly impact the legal landscape on distracted driving. The New Jersey and Pennsylvania cases underscore the challenges in such cases. For instance, it's not enough to hold a texter liable simply because he or she texted a driver: Certain conditions must be met, such as knowing (or having good reason to believe) the driver would pick up the phone to check out texts while driving, as well as proving a \"special relationship\" exists between texter and recipient to influence the recipient picking up. But these kinds of cases, as well as other proposed crackdowns on car texters (including New York's controversial \"textalyzer\" bill), show the issue is being given heavier weight. \"People often see distracted driving as a socially acceptable sin … an innocuous guilty pleasure in which everyone indulges,\" a University of South Carolina law professor tells Vocativ. \"The same used to be true of drunk driving ...

He survived with only a scratch and told a police officer he'd fallen asleep at the wheel. The officer suspected the crash might've been intentional and the 27-year-old spent a night at a mental health facility in Frisco. A day later, the Breckenridge man was released and disappeared, reports the Washington Post. His family told the Summit Daily News McAtee had 10 days earlier stopped taking his medication for bipolar disorder, just as he had done a few times before when he dropped out of sight, but he always resurfaced. Over the next year, they scoured the country in search of him, thinking perhaps he'd gone off the grid like Chris McCandless, the subject of his favorite book, Into the Wild. They reached out to contacts in Alaska, where McAtee had flown planes, and homeless shelters, where they thought he might volunteer, but found no sign of him. In July, McAtee's father wrote online that \"there is a 50% chance that Jack wandered off into the wilderness and attempted to survive.\" But a month later, two hikers found a skull near the top of the Peak One, immediately south of Frisco; DNA confirmation that the skull was McAtee's came earlier this month. \"Our search has come to fruition,\" McAtee's family wrote. \"Our closure is at hand, albeit we acknowledge it will be a lifelong process.\" It's still not clear how or when McAtee died. His skull was all that was found of his remains, reports the Denver Post. What is certain: \"A person, an irreplaceable person, is gone,\" his family says.

The National Hurricane Center (NHC) warned of \"torrential rains\" that would cause \"catastrophic damage\" as the storm continued to pull moisture off warm waters in the Gulf of Mexico. The storm was the first Category 4 hurricane to hit the continental United States in over a decade, and the first to make landfall in Texas since 1961.

The agencies have various acquisition and disposal authorities, but the extent of their authority varies. The National Park Service (NPS) has no general authority to acquire land to create new park units or to dispose of park lands. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has relatively broad authority for both acquisitions and disposals. The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) has various authorities to acquire lands but no general authority to dispose of its lands.

The bill has been met with opposition from the Catholic Church and other conservative groups, who have argued that it goes against traditional values. Despite this, the bill has been supported by many in France, with polls showing that 51% of people support same-sex marriage. The bill also includes provisions for same-sex couples to access medically assisted procreation, although this will be debated separately. The debate has sparked large protests in France, with around 340,000 people turning out in Paris to protest the reform. The anti-gay marriage camp has promised to stage a new rally on March 24.

The women, Alice Evans, Katherine Kendall, and Tomi-Ann Roberts, discuss how they felt ashamed and isolated after their encounters with Weinstein, and how they only came forward after seeing other women share their stories. They also discuss the importance of forgiveness and the need for accountability in the entertainment industry.\n\nPassage 3 reveals that Harvey Weinstein used nondisclosure agreements to evade accountability for claims of sexual harassment and assault for at least 20 years. The agreements were often used to silence victims and prevent them from speaking out, and were sometimes used to conceal payments made to victims. The article also discusses how Weinstein's defense team used private investigators to dig up information on his accusers, including Ambra Battilana Gutierrez, who was paid $1 million to keep quiet about an incident in which Weinstein groped her.\n\nPassage 4 reports on a bid by Maria Contreras-Sweet, a former head of the U.S. Small Business Administration, to acquire The Weinstein Company. The bid, which includes a plan to leave 51% of the company controlled by women, is seen as a potential solution to the company's financial woes. The article also notes that the bid comes with a plan to set aside contingency funds to make whole the coming wave of plaintiffs.\n\nPassage 5 discusses the corporate culture of The Weinstein Company, highlighting the dysfunction of the board of directors and the company's failure to address allegations of misconduct by Harvey Weinstein. The article notes that the board was dominated by friends of Weinstein, who enabled his behavior and failed to take action against him.

His death sparked a debate over whether President Barack Obama should nominate a replacement, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell calling for the vacancy to be filled after Obama's presidency ends. Obama vowed to nominate a successor, but the Senate's Republican majority is likely to block the nomination. Scalia was a conservative icon who transformed the court by instilling in it his belief that judges should follow the precise words of the Constitution and not apply a modern interpretation. He was the first justice of Italian-American heritage and passed through confirmation with a unanimous vote. Scalia's death has significant implications for the Supreme Court, which is currently considering several major cases, including a challenge to public sector unions, a race-conscious admissions plan at the University of Texas, and a big abortion case. The court can try to go ahead, but on cases where they are split 4-4, their only options are to leave the lower court decision intact or to hold the case over until Justice Scalia's replacement is confirmed. Scalia's legacy is enormous, and he was one of the \"handful of most influential Supreme Court justices in history.\" He was the Court's leading originalist, fiercely dedicated to the idea that the meaning of the words in the Constitution are fixed based on the framers' understanding at the time they were drafted, and not subject to reinterpretation in later times.

His death has left a significant void on the Supreme Court, and his replacement will be a major topic of debate in the coming months. Scalia's death has also sparked a debate over the role of the Supreme Court in American society, with some arguing that the court should be more active in shaping the law and others arguing that it should be more limited in its role.

The agency's hacking capabilities are so advanced that they can bypass encryption on popular messaging apps, including WhatsApp and Signal. However, security experts argue that the CIA's hacking tools are not as sophisticated as claimed, and that the agency's methods are more focused on exploiting vulnerabilities in devices rather than cracking encryption. The documents also reveal that the CIA has developed a range of hacking tools, including a tool called \"Weeping Angel\" that can turn a Samsung smart TV into a monitoring device. The tool, which was developed in 2014, can be loaded onto a TV via a USB firmware update and can record conversations in a room. However, the tool only works on Samsung TVs from 2012 and 2013 with outdated firmware versions. The CIA's hacking tools have been criticized for being overly broad and for potentially putting everyday users at risk.

{"pred": "A study published in the journal Translational Psychiatry found that children born to older fathers tend to have higher IQs, are more focused on their interests, and are less concerned with social norms. The study analyzed data from 7,781 British twins and found that the \"geek index\" score, which combines non-verbal IQ, focus on subjects of interest, and social aloofness, was higher in children born to fathers aged 35-44 and 50 or older. The study suggests that this may be due to the fact that men who delay fatherhood tend to be more educated and have better jobs, and therefore pass on these traits to their children. The study also found that the \"geek effect\" was stronger in boys than girls, and that girls with older fathers may be geeky in different ways. The study's authors note that the findings do not mean that men should delay fatherhood in order to have more intelligent children, but rather that there may be evolutionary advantages to having children later in life. The study's findings have been met with interest and skepticism, with some scientists suggesting that the link between paternal age and geekiness may be due to genetic factors, while others argue that the study's findings are not generalizable to individual families. Overall, the study suggests that there may be a link between paternal age and the development of geeky traits in children, but more research is needed to fully understand this relationship. The study's findings have been seen as a rare positive outcome in the science of delayed fatherhood, which has previously been associated with increased risk of autism and schizophrenia. The study's authors suggest that the trend for delayed parenthood may lead to a \"society of geniuses\" that can solve the world's problems. However, other scientists have cautioned that the dangers of older parenting, such as increased risk of infertility and miscarriage, should not be ignored. The study's findings have sparked debate and discussion about the relationship between paternal age and child development, and highlight the need for further research in this area. The study's authors also suggest that some genetic traits inherited from older fathers may affect both geekiness and autism, and that a higher \"dose\" of these genes may increase the risk of autism.

More specifically, they tend to score higher on what the researchers call the \"geek index,\" reports the Guardian. And this is clearly seen as a positive: \"If you look at who does well in life right now, it’s geeks,\" says Magdalena Janecka at King’s College London. The geek index, she explains, is determined by such factors as ability to focus, non-verbal IQ scores taken at age 12, and social aloofness. The latter trait may sound like a negative, but the BBC frames it as the boys not being overly concerned with fitting in. A mother's age appears to have no impact. The team studied more than 7,000 sets of twins in the UK. The average geek score for boys born to dads 25 or younger is 39. It goes up to 41 when dads had the child between 35 and 44, and jumps to 47 when dads were 50 or older. The impact was less pronounced on girls, and more pronounced when measuring science, tech, engineering, and math scores. Kids born to fathers 50 or older were 32% more likely to earn at least two A's on standardized tests than children born to men aged under 25, the researchers report in Translational Psychiatry. They calculate that 57% of the geek index score is inherited, with possible overlap between genes that contribute to a high geek score and to autism. “Our primary hypothesis is that higher levels of those ‘geeky’ traits in offspring of older men are mainly due is due to characteristics of the fathers themselves,\" Janecka tells Newsweek. \"Men who decide to delay fatherhood often do so due to their extended career and educational pursuits, and likely themselves display higher levels of ‘geekiness.’” (Younger fathers are also likelier to die younger.)"], "length": 57166}

Well, Hollywood checked the balance sheet and decided to stop making their kind of mid-budget films, Flavorwire reports. It's all dollars and cents: Thoughtful or offbeat films costing $5 million to $60 million can make moderate profits at best, while blockbusters with international appeal are able to bring in sick money. Paramount's Titanic made that point in 1997 by costing $200 million and earning nearly $2.2 billion worldwide. At that time, mid-budget films like Kiss the Girls and In & Out dominated the Paramount slate and drew modest profits; this year, mega-flicks like Transformers: Age of Extinction, Hercules, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles rule Paramount's roost and earn the big bucks. \"You could make movies in the ten-to-twenty-million-dollar budget range\" at one time, says Susan Seidelman, director of Desperately Seeking Susan. Now, she says, studios \"have to appeal to every demographic in every part of the world.\" And few seasoned directors want to test the indie market, where tons of under-$2 million films are vying for attention. So Spike Lee has funded a film via Kickstarter, Steven Soderbergh publicly quit feature filmmaking last year, and other directors are turning to TV for creative freedom.

The researchers also found that East Antarctica is losing relatively little ice, but it's unclear if this trend will continue.

The study, which tracked the use of cigarettes and e-cigarettes among 5,490 California high school seniors, found that the rate of teenagers using nicotine, either through tobacco cigarettes or e-cigarettes, is on the rise, with about 14% of Southern California high school seniors in 2014 saying they had smoked or vaped in the last 30 days. The study's lead author, Jessica Barrington-Trimis, noted that the numbers suggest that e-cigarettes are not just replacing cigarette smoking, but are also enticing an entirely new group of teenagers to use nicotine. The study's findings are consistent with national trends, with the National Youth Tobacco Survey showing a long-term decline in teen smoking rates followed by a leveling off between 2014 and 2015. The study's results have significant implications for public health, as nicotine experimentation could become nicotine addiction for youth who never used any other tobacco products. The study's findings are also consistent with a recent study published in Pediatrics, which found that adolescents who vape are six times more likely to try regular cigarettes within about a year when compared to those who have never vaped. The study's results suggest that e-cigarettes may be serving as a gateway to traditional tobacco products, and that the use of e-cigarettes by nonsmoking adolescents poses several potential public health problems, including nicotine dependence and adverse effects on cognitive function and development. Overall, the study's findings highlight the need for further research on the effects of e-cigarettes on adolescent health and the potential risks associated with their use.

Another USC study finds older teens who try vaping are six times more likely to try a tobacco-filled cigarette than non-vapers, per a press release. \"E-cigarettes may be recruiting a new group of kids to tobacco use,\" says Jessica Barrington-Trimis, lead author of both studies.

The study, which analyzed data from over 7,000 British twins, suggests that having an older father may benefit children and boost their performance in technical subjects at secondary school. The researchers used a \"geek index\" to measure the traits of the children, which included non-verbal IQ, focus on subjects of interest, and social aloofness.

The study's findings suggest that there may be a link between advanced paternal age and a phenotypic advantage, with older fathers passing on beneficial traits to their children.

The main arguments presented in the passages suggest that the law should consider the nature of the parties' past relationship when dealing with sex and dementia, and that spouses should be treated differently from others in this context. The key evidence presented includes the fact that Henry and Donna Rayhons were deeply in love and had a long history of intimacy, and that Donna's daughters were concerned about their mother's worsening dementia and the way Rayhons was caring for her. The passages also highlight the challenges of determining whether a person with dementia is capable of giving consent, and the need for a more nuanced approach to this issue. The unique point made in the passages is that the law should not require lovers or spouses to wake each other up before touching each other's genitals, even when past practice suggests this is consensual. The passages also discuss the Iowa law on sexual abuse, which treats spouses differently from others, but not enough to cover long-term lovers who are not married. The main conclusion of the passages is that the law should be crafted to preclude third-party complaints and allow spouses to have a marital relationship, even when one partner has dementia. The passages also mention a Slate article by Daniel Engber, which provides an interesting take on this issue. Overall, the passages present a complex and nuanced discussion of the issue of sex and dementia, highlighting the need for a more thoughtful and compassionate approach to this issue.

But prosecutors have filed felony charges against him, saying that her Alzheimer's made her unable to consent to his sexual desires, Bloomberg reports via the Washington Post. Henry Rayhons, 78, now out on a $10,000 bond, has declined to run for a 10th straight term in the state House, saying his reputation is ruined. But he seems angrier about how his relationship with his wife, Donna, is being portrayed. \"My wife just died and you’re charged with something like this because you prayed by her bed,\" he says, sobbing. \"It hurts. It really hurts.\" Bloomberg gives a detailed account of how things went sour between Rayhons, Donna's three daughters, and officials at the Concord Care Center in Garner, Iowa. The daughters had Donna placed in the home, where Rayhons visited often and wanted sex once or twice daily, one of the daughters said. \"Henry likes this a lot,\" Donna reportedly said while pointing between her legs, and staffers were said to be \"sickened.\" Rayhons was given a physician-approved document saying that Donna couldn't consent to sex, but he allegedly continued and may have admitted as much to a state investigator. \"It was not a regular thing,\" Rayhons told him, saying he \"never touched her when she didn’t want it and I only tried to fulfill her need when she asked for it.\" Iowa state law doesn't help him, stating that sex with a permanently mentally ill lover is illegal unless that person \"is both a spouse and cohabiting,\" the Post notes. Charged with third-degree sexual abuse, Rayhons is scheduled to begin his trial on Jan. 28 in Garner."], "length": 54253}
