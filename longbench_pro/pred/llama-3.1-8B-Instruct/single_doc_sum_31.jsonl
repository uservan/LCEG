Professor B mentions that they went through old emails and found that they were consistently saying they were two months away from completion. The team is considering doing the same kind of status report to track progress. Professor B suggests waiting for Sunil to arrive before doing his status report. The discussion then shifts to Barry's work on Aurora, where he is writing a proposal and hopes to finish a rough draft by Monday. He explains his approach to classifying intermediate categories and using multi-band techniques to improve phoneme recognition. The team discusses the use of TIMIT and Switchboard datasets, as well as the SRI recognizer. Dave presents his results on mean subtraction, which improved the word error rate on TI-digits but worsened it on near-mike performance. He suggests that the SRI system may be doing channel adaptation, which could be the reason for the improvement. Professor B suggests that they could try to remove low-energy sections and set them to zero, which could help with reverberation. The team discusses the possibility of using a VAD-like approach to remove low-energy sections. They also discuss the use of Wiener filtering and the potential benefits of smoothing the SNR estimate. Grad E mentions that he has been working on normalizing the phase, but it didn't work as expected. Professor B suggests that they could try to reverse the process and subtract the phase to get rid of the speech. The team discusses the potential benefits of using a combination of energy and spectral information for VAD. They also discuss the use of a probability-based approach to combine the decisions of different VAD systems.

He plans to start with regular phonetic features and use multi-band techniques to combine them and perform phoneme recognition. He will then look at the errors produced in the phoneme recognition and use them to postulate new intermediate categories or remove existing ones. Grad F will use the TIMIT dataset for the initial part of the process and then shift to the Switchboard dataset to model intermediate categories that span across phonemes. He aims to get a full rough draft done by Monday and will give it to Morgan.\n\nSummary: Passage 2\n\nProfessor B and PhD C discussed the results of various systems, including combo, OGI two, and others. They compared the performance of these systems on different test sets, including TI-digits and SpeechDat-Car. The results showed that the combo system performed well on highly mismatched Italian, but not as well on the mismatched condition. Professor B suggested that the delay problem might be the reason for the poor performance on the mismatched condition. PhD C mentioned that they had tried to reduce the delay, but it was still a problem. The discussion also touched on the weighting scheme used to evaluate the results, which was 40% for TI-digits, 60% for SpeechDat-Car, and 25% for highly mismatched Italian. Professor B suggested that they should compare the results of the combo system with the other systems using this weighting scheme.\n\nSummary: Passage 3\n\nThe passage discusses the certification process for postsecondary schools to participate in federal student aid programs.

{"pred": " Passage 1\n\nThe discussion on mean subtraction in SRI revolves around its potential benefits and limitations. Dave E. noticed that mean subtraction made the PZM signals louder after re-synthesis, which could be a gain control effect. However, Professor B. pointed out that simply multiplying the signal by two would not have the same effect, suggesting that the improvement in signal-to-noise ratio might be the actual reason. The group also discussed the possibility of reverberation and echo effects in the re-synthesized audio, which could be addressed by applying a VAD-like technique to remove low-energy sections. Professor B. suggested that this could be a simple solution to the problem, but it would require careful implementation to avoid removing speech. The discussion highlights the complexities of audio processing and the need for careful consideration of various factors to achieve optimal results.\n\nSummary: Passage 2\n\nThe discussion focuses on the performance of different systems, including OGI, combo, and HTK, on various test sets. The combo system, which combines features from OGI and HTK, shows promising results, particularly on the highly mismatched Italian test set. However, the group notes that the delay problem associated with the combo system makes it unsuitable for use in the final evaluation. The discussion also touches on the weighting scheme used to evaluate the systems, with 40% weight for TI-digits, 60% for SpeechDat-Cars, and 25% for highly mismatched conditions.

He suggested that the problem might be caused by the re-synthesis process, which introduces reverberation-like effects. He proposed a solution, which involves setting low-energy sections to zero, similar to what Hirsch did in the 1980s. This approach would eliminate the low-energy parts of the speech where reverberation is most audible. The professor also mentioned that the system could be improved by using a VAD-like approach to remove low-energy sections. He noted that the reverberation time in the room is around 0.7-0.8 seconds, which is relatively short. However, he pointed out that the system is still affected by reverberation, and that the problem might be caused by the averaging of multiple windows stretching out to 12 seconds. He also suggested that the system could be improved by using a Wiener filter to remove reverberation.\n\nSummary: Passage 2\n\nThe professor and PhD C discussed the results of various speech recognition systems, including the combo system, which combines features from OGI and MSG.

PhD C mentioned that the delay problem prevented the use of a second silence detection. The professor suggested that the system could be improved by using a weighted measure, which would combine the results of different systems. He also noted that the system could be improved by reducing the dimensionality of the KLT. The professor and PhD C discussed the sizes of the test sets, which ranged from 500 to 2000 sentences, with an average of 4-5 digits per sentence. They also discussed the use of a silence detection system, which was not used due to the delay problem.\n\nSummary: Passage 3\n\nThe passage describes the certification process for postsecondary schools to participate in federal student aid programs.

On a day-to-day basis, however, the House can also decide to grant individual bills privileged access to the floor, using one of several parliamentary mechanisms. The standing rules of the House include several different parliamentary mechanisms that the body may use to act on bills and resolutions. Which of these will be employed in a given instance usually depends on the extent to which Members want to debate and amend the legislation. In general, all of the procedures of the House permit a majority of Members to work their will without excessive delay. The House considers most legislation by motions to suspend the rules, with limited debate and no floor amendments, with the support of at least two-thirds of the Members voting. Occasionally, the House will choose to consider a measure on the floor by the unanimous consent of Members. The Rules Committee is instrumental in recommending procedures for considering major bills and may propose restrictions on the floor amendments that Members can offer or bar them altogether. Many major bills are first considered in Committee of the Whole before being passed by a simple majority vote of the House. The Committee of the Whole is governed by more flexible procedures than the basic rules of the House, under which a majority can vote to pass a bill after only one hour of debate and with no floor amendments. Although a quorum is supposed to be present on the floor when the House is conducting business, the House assumes a quorum is present unless a quorum call or electronically recorded vote demonstrates that it is not. However, the standing rules preclude quorum calls at most times other than when the House is voting. Questions are first decided by voice vote, although any Member may then demand a division vote. Before the final result of a voice or division vote is announced, Members can secure an electronically recorded vote instead if enough Members desire it or if a quorum is not present in the House.

The State Vocational Rehabilitation Services program is the primary federal effort to help individuals with disabilities prepare for and obtain employment. State VR agencies work with individuals to develop an individualized plan for employment, which describes the employment goal and the specific services needed to achieve that goal. Education's Rehabilitation Services Administration awards funds to state VR agencies to help individuals with disabilities engage in gainful employment. States must provide a 21.3 percent nonfederal match of these funds. In fiscal year 2016, total program funds for VR, including state match funds, were $3.81 billion. Most state VR agencies reported expanding services for students with disabilities since WIOA's enactment in July 2014. Most agencies reported providing the five required activities to more students with disabilities since WIOA's enactment. State VR agencies reported taking a range of actions to build their administrative capacity to implement pre-employment transition services, including building staff capacity and expanding contracts with service providers. However, some state VR agencies reported challenges in using the funds reserved for pre-employment transition services, citing difficulties in identifying eligible students and providing services to a younger population. Education officials stated that they plan to clarify guidance on allowable expenditures using reserved funds and will provide additional information on timeframes for when this information will be provided. The Department of Education has not provided detailed information on allowable expenditures for pre-employment transition services, leading to confusion among state VR agencies.

GAO reviewed documents and funding data from Education, and federal laws and regulations; surveyed all 79 state VR agencies (74 responded); held discussion groups with representatives of 29 state VR agencies; and interviewed officials from Education and three states (Idaho, Illinois, and Maryland) GAO selected for variety in size and type of agencies, among other factors. Of the 74 state vocational rehabilitation (VR) agencies that responded to GAO's survey, most reported expanding services to help students with disabilities transition from school to work as required under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), enacted in July 2014. Most state agencies reported serving more students and providing work-based learning experiences and other activities, referred to as pre-employment transition services (see figure). State VR agencies reported two key challenges with implementing pre-employment transition services for students as required by WIOA. Spending reserved funds : States reported spending about $357 million out of the $465 million reserved for these services in fiscal year 2016. Education officials said that states had difficulty determining what expenditures were allowable, and some state officials said they would like more detailed information from Education. Education officials said they plan to clarify guidance but have no timeframe for providing further information, which would help states to better plan their use of reserved funds. Finalizing interagency agreements : Fewer than half the state VR agencies that responded to GAO's survey (34 of 74) reported updating their interagency agreement with their state's educational agency. Interagency agreements can help promote collaboration by, for example, establishing roles and responsibilities of each agency. Although Education offers technical assistance on interagency agreements, without increased efforts to raise awareness about the importance of these agreements and provide assistance to states where needed, Education may miss opportunities to help state VR and educational agencies efficiently and effectively coordinate services. In addition, WIOA requires Education to highlight best state practices, and most VR agencies responding to GAO's survey (63 of 74) reported this would be useful. Education does not have a written plan or timeframe for identifying and disseminating best practices. As a result, Education may miss opportunities to help more students with disabilities successfully transition from school to work.

{"pred": " Passage 2\nThe Buy American Act of 1933 was enacted to create and preserve jobs for American workers during the Great Depression. The Act establishes a preference for the federal government to buy domestic end products. However, there are exceptions and waivers that allow the government to purchase foreign end products. The Act does not apply to products purchased for use outside the United States or obtained through contracts under the micro-purchase threshold. The federal government obligated approximately $7.8 billion for the acquisition of foreign end products in fiscal year 2017, which accounts for less than 5 percent of total federal contract obligations for end products in that year. The government procured foreign end products through various exceptions and waivers, including the DOD qualifying country exception, trade agreements, and the micro-purchase threshold. The Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) is working to improve the accuracy of data reporting in the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG). The GAO recommends that the OFPP facilitate additional training to improve the understanding of the contracting workforce regarding the Buy American Act requirements and clarify revisions to FPDS-NG to improve the accuracy of the Buy American data. The GAO also recommends that the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services provide guidance and training to help contracting officials implement the Buy American Act requirements. The GAO found that agencies faced various levels of challenge in applying the Trade Agreements Act waivers and Buy American Act exceptions to acquire foreign end products. The GAO recommends that the agencies provide targeted information to address challenging areas and ensure that contracting officers take the steps needed to meet requirements when applying a domestic non-availability exception. The GAO also recommends that the agencies identify sources of information available for determining product origin and the steps they should take to verify information that is inconsistent. The GAO found that the federal agencies have responsibilities to ensure Buy American Act data are accurate and complete, but the lack of good data can hinder congressional oversight of the extent to which foreign end products are procured as authorized by one of the exceptions or waivers of the Buy American Act.

The Act permits agencies to buy foreign end products only under certain exceptions, such as when domestic items are not available at a reasonable cost. Further, U.S. trade agreements waive the Buy American restrictions for certain products. GAO was asked to review implementation of the Buy American Act. This report assesses the extent to which (1) the federal government procures foreign products through Buy American Act exceptions and waivers; and (2) selected agencies provide training and guidance to implement the Act. GAO reviewed laws, regulations, and policies related to the Buy American Act and analyzed data for fiscal year 2017 from FPDS-NG. GAO also analyzed a non-generalizable sample of 38 contracts from DOD, HHS, DHS, and VA—the agencies with the most obligations for products in fiscal year 2017. The 38 awards selected include a mix of foreign and domestic products, as well as dollars obligated. Finally, GAO interviewed cognizant contracting and policy officials from the selected agencies. According to data reported in the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG) in fiscal year 2017, foreign end products accounted for less than 5 percent—about $7.8 billion—of federal obligations for products potentially subject to the Buy American Act. Federal agencies procured foreign products using exceptions to Buy American Act requirements, as well as through waivers or when the Buy American Act did not apply, as shown in the figure. The amount of foreign end products purchased could be greater than reported in FPDS-NG, however, due to reporting errors and system limitations. GAO found that 6 of the 38 contracts reviewed from the Departments of Defense (DOD), Health and Human Services (HHS), Homeland Security (DHS), and Veterans Affairs (VA) inaccurately recorded waiver or exception information. FPDS-NG system limitations compound these errors because it does not fully capture Buy American Act data. Among other things, the database does not always enable agencies to report the use of exceptions or waivers on contracts for both foreign and domestic products, reducing data accuracy. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is considering strategies to improve Buy American Act data. The four agencies GAO reviewed varied in their approaches to Buy American Act training and guidance. DOD reports that it will have trained more than 18,000 personnel by the end of 2018. DHS reports training almost 1,400 people—approximately 94 percent of its contracting staff—as of April 2018. Some VA courses mention the Act, but none is focused specifically on implementing its requirements. HHS does not have agency-level training or guidance on the Act. GAO found that contracting officers for the contracts it reviewed face challenges implementing Buy American Act requirements. Having specific and targeted Buy American Act guidance and training can better ensure that agencies meet the Act's requirements.

{"pred": " Passage 4\nThe Black Lung Disability Trust Fund is used to finance the payment of federal Black Lung Program benefits under Part C of the Black Lung Benefits Act (BLBA) when a responsible coal operator does not meet its obligations under the law to pay benefits. The fund is primarily financed by an excise tax on coal, which has been declining in recent years. The trust fund's cumulative debt at the end of FY2017 was $3.1 billion, and projections suggest that borrowing from the general fund will increase over the next few years. The trust fund's debt is not on a path to be eliminated, and by FY2050, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) projects the trust fund's debt will be $15.4 billion without any changes in current policy. The GAO suggests that increasing the coal excise tax rate by 25% would eliminate the trust fund's debt, leaving the trust fund with a surplus of $0.6 billion in 2050. The trust fund's primary expenditures are for the payment of Part C benefits to miners in cases in which there is no responsible operator. To reduce expenditures and improve the long-term financial health of the trust fund, Congress could consider several options to reduce the generosity and scope of benefits or increase the ability of the federal government to ensure that coal operators, even those who are in the bankruptcy process, pay benefits for their miners. The GAO also suggests that forgiving the trust fund's interest or debt obligations would shift the burden of paying for black lung disability benefits from the coal industry to general taxpayers. However, a one-time appropriation to forgive interest or debt is a transparent option for satisfying the trust fund's obligations to the general fund. The trust fund's fiscal outlook has been improved through interest and debt forgiveness in the past, but the GAO projects that if all current debt were forgiven, the trust fund would accumulate $2.3 billion in new debt by 2050. If all interest were forgiven, the trust fund debt is projected to be $5.8 billion by 2050. The trust fund's primary revenue source is the coal excise tax, which has been declining in recent years. The trust fund also receives revenue from the collection of certain fines, penalties, and interest paid by coal operators and miners and reimbursements from responsible operators. The trust fund's debt is a result of the ongoing situation of trust fund expenditures exceeding trust fund revenues. The trust fund's cumulative debt has trended downward since the restructuring, but coal excise tax revenue has been", "answers": ["The federal government pays benefits to coal miners affected by coal workers' pneumoconiosis (CWP, commonly referred to as black lung disease) and other lung diseases linked to coal mining in cases where responsible mine operators are not able to pay. In 2019, the monthly benefit for a miner with no dependents is $660.10. Benefits can be as much as $1,320.10 per month for miners with three or more dependents. Medical benefits are provided separately from disability benefits. Benefit payments and related administrative expenses in cases in which the responsible operators do not pay are paid out of the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund. The primary source of revenue for the trust fund is an excise tax on coal produced and sold domestically. If excise tax revenue is not sufficient to finance Black Lung Program benefits, the trust fund may borrow from the general fund of the Treasury. For 2018, the tax rates on coal were $1.10 per ton of underground-mined coal or $0.55 per ton of surface-mined coal, limited to 4.4% of the sales price. These rates were established in 1986. Starting in 2019, under current law, these tax rates are $0.50 per ton of underground-mined coal or $0.25 per ton of surface-mined coal, limited to 2% of the sales price. These are the rates that were set when the trust fund was established in 1977. The decline in the excise tax rates will likely put additional financial strain on a trust fund that already borrows from the general fund to meet obligations. The decline in domestic coal production, recent increases in the rate of CWP, and bankruptcies in the coal sector also contribute to the financial strain on the trust fund. The Black Lung Disability Trust Fund and associated excise tax on coal were established so that the coal industry, as opposed to taxpayers in general, would bear the burden associated with providing black lung benefits. Throughout its history, the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund has not raised revenues sufficient to meet obligations. As a result, at various points in time, Congress and the President have acted to increase the excise tax on coal, forgive or refinance trust fund debt, and modify black lung benefits eligibility. With the rate of the excise tax on coal reduced in 2019, the 116th Congress may again evaluate options for improving the fiscal condition of the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund, or other issues related to providing federal benefits to miners with black lung disease."], "length": 25794}

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (VAMC) officials are responsible for reviewing the clinical care delivered by their privileged providers—physicians and dentists who are approved to independently perform specific services—after concerns are raised. The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care.

The plan aims to reduce costs by 20% and close or consolidate 74 of its 112 facilities in the continental United States. DLA Document Services has also implemented a print device procurement service that has resulted in savings of 33-45% compared to customers' prior costs. However, there are still areas where further gains may be possible, including better managing fragmentation in printing and reproduction services, reducing overlap in procuring print devices, meeting goals to reduce the number of print devices, and consolidating locations that provide mission specialty printing. DOD's O&M budget materials for printing and reproduction activities are inaccurate, as they include non-printing activities and omit information on device procurement and electronic content management. To address these issues, DOD should ensure that the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment assesses whether DLA Document Services' single manager role provides the best value to the government and whether any additional efficiencies are possible. DOD should also ensure that the DOD CIO implements controls to monitor actions to reduce the number of print devices and assigns responsibility for implementing the CIO's 2012 memorandum on optimizing the use of employee information technology devices.

Other DOD components, including the military services, also maintain some document services capabilities at various locations. House Report 115-200 accompanying a bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2018 included a provision for GAO to examine DOD's document services. This report evaluates (1) the progress DOD has made in achieving efficiencies in its document services and opportunities, if any, to achieve further efficiencies, and (2) the extent to which DOD reports accurate financial information about its document services to key stakeholders. GAO reviewed documents and interviewed officials regarding DOD's efficiency initiatives, including DLA Document Services' transformation plan; reviewed print device procurement contracts and pricing information; and analyzed DOD budget data for fiscal years 2012 through 2016. The Department of Defense (DOD) has taken steps to achieve efficiencies in its document services, including implementing a transformation plan to consolidate existing Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Document Services facilities. However, GAO identified four areas where further gains may be possible: Managing fragmentation in printing and reproduction services. DOD has designated DLA Document Services as the single manager for printing and reproduction services, but DOD customers, citing concerns with DLA's services, have also obtained these services directly from the Government Publishing Office and via in-house print facilities (see fig.). DOD has not assessed DLA's performance in this role or whether additional efficiencies may be possible in light of DLA's transformation plan. Reducing overlap in procuring print devices. GAO found that DOD components used at least four different contract sources to acquire print devices. DOD has not assessed which acquisition approach represents the best value; doing so might better position DOD to further reduce its costs. Meeting goals to reduce the number of print devices. DOD and the military services have not demonstrated that they achieved established goals for reducing the number of print devices. Additional controls and assignment of oversight responsibilities to monitor progress could better enable DOD to achieve its cost savings goals, estimated to be millions of dollars annually. Consolidating DLA facilities. DLA is closing or consolidating 74 of its 112 facilities in the United States. However, GAO found that for four of seven types of specialty services, DLA plans to retain facilities that are responsible for less than 5 percent of the total revenue for each of those specialties, which suggests that further consolidations are possible. DOD includes the cost of non-printing activities, such as the purchase of advertising time for recruiting, within its budget materials for printing and reproduction. It does not include costs to acquire print devices and for electronic content management. As a result, DOD and the Congress lack the oversight into total document services costs needed to make informed decisions.

Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act) establishes the process for states or tribal entities to request a presidential disaster declaration. FEMA has primary responsibility for coordinating the federal response when a disaster is declared, including providing assistance through the Individual Assistance (IA), Public Assistance, and Hazard Mitigation Assistance programs. The IA program provides financial and direct assistance to disaster victims for expenses and needs that cannot be met through other means, such as insurance. FEMA evaluates IA declaration requests using six regulatory factors, including concentration of damages, trauma, special populations, voluntary agency assistance, insurance coverage, and average amount of individual assistance by state. The President declared 57% of IA declaration requests from 2008 to 2016, with total IA obligations of approximately $8.6 billion. FEMA's regional offices do not consistently obtain and document information on all elements of the IA regulatory factors, and the agency has not collected all information on all factors because one factor may have more weight than another based on the specific incident. The lack of transparency in the decision-making process and difficulty gathering information on IA regulatory factors are also challenges in the IA declaration process. The Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 proposed revising the six current IA regulatory factors, but the proposed rule has not been finalized.

When a state, U.S. territory, or tribe requests IA assistance through a federal disaster declaration, FEMA evaluates the request against regulatory factors, such as concentration of damages, and provides a recommendation to the President, who makes a final declaration decision. GAO was asked to review FEMA's IA declaration process. This report examines (1) the number of IA declaration requests received, declared, and denied, and IA actual obligations from calendar years 2008 through 2016, (2) the extent to which FEMA accounts for the regulatory factors when evaluating IA requests, and (3) any challenges FEMA regions and select states reported on the declaration process and factors and any FEMA actions to revise them. GAO reviewed FEMA's policies, IA declaration requests and obligation data, and FEMA's RVARs from July 2012 through December 2016, the most recent years for which data were available. GAO also reviewed proposed rulemaking comments and interviewed FEMA officials from all 10 regions and 11 state emergency management offices selected based on declaration requests and other factors. From calendar years 2008 through 2016, the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Federal Emergency and Management Agency (FEMA) received 294 Individual Assistance (IA) declaration requests from states, U.S. territories, and tribes to help individuals meet their immediate needs after a disaster. Of these, the President declared 168 and denied 126 requests. Across the various types of IA declaration requests, severe storms (190) were the most common disaster type and drought (1) was among the least common. FEMA obligated about $8.6 billion in IA for disaster declarations during this period. GAO found that FEMA regions did not consistently obtain and document information on all elements of established IA regulatory factors when making IA recommendations to headquarters. Following a declaration request, a FEMA region is to prepare a Regional Administrator's Validation and Recommendation (RVAR)—a document designed to include data on each of the six IA regulatory factors for each declaration request as well as the regional administrator's recommendation. GAO reviewed all 81 RVARs from July 2012—the date FEMA began using the new RVAR template—through December 2016. GAO found that regions did not consistently obtain and document information for the elements required under the six regulatory factors (see table). For example, only 44 of the 81 RVARs documented all elements under the concentration of damage factor. By evaluating why regions are not completing all elements of each current IA regulatory factor, FEMA could identify whether any corrective steps are needed. Officials from the 10 FEMA regions and 11 states GAO interviewed, reported positive relationships with each other, but also cited various challenges with the IA declaration process and regulatory factors. For example, these officials told GAO that there are no established minimum thresholds for IA, making final determinations more subjective and the rationale behind denials unclear. However, as required by the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013, FEMA has taken steps to revise the IA factors by issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking. According to FEMA, the proposed rule aims to provide more objective criteria, clarify the threshold for eligibility, and speed up the IA declaration process. As of April 2018, the proposed rule was still under consideration. According to FEMA officials, they plan to finalize the rule in late 2018; therefore, it is too early to know the extent to which it will address these challenges. GAO recommends that FEMA evaluate why regions are not completing the RVARs for each element of the current IA regulatory factors and take corrective steps, if necessary.

The VA has a large inventory of vacant or underutilized buildings, with 430 vacant or mostly vacant buildings over 60 years old. The historic status of some facilities adds to the complexity of converting or disposing of them. The VA has not consistently followed best practices for engaging stakeholders, leading to adversarial relationships that reduce its ability to align facilities with the needs of the veteran population. The VA's Strategic Capital Investment Planning (SCIP) process has limitations, including subjective narratives, long timeframes, and restricted access to information, which undermine its ability to achieve its goals. The VA has also encountered challenges in its facility alignment efforts due to the shift from inpatient to outpatient care, which will result in underutilized space. The VA has not addressed these limitations, and without doing so, it will not have reasonable assurance that SCIP can be used to accurately identify the capital necessary to address VA's service and infrastructure gaps. The VA's Integrated Planning (VAIP) process has also been criticized for assuming all future growth in services will be provided directly through VA facilities, which is not accurate. The VA has discontinued its VAIP facility master plans while pursuing a national realignment strategy. The VA should consider the seven elements used by the Department of Defense (DOD) in its BRAC process, including establishing goals, developing criteria, estimating costs and savings, establishing an organizational structure, developing a common analytical framework, developing BRAC oversight mechanisms, and involving the audit community. These elements could help the VA improve its facility alignment efforts and ensure that its services and real property portfolio are aligned with the needs of veterans. The VA's efforts to address vacancies are not guided by a corrective action plan that identifies the root causes of persistent vacancies and suggests corrective measures to reduce such vacancies. Without such a plan, overseas vacancies may persist and continue to adversely affect the VA's ability to achieve its mission. The VA should develop an integrated action plan that defines the root causes of persistent vacancies and provides suggested corrective measures to reduce such vacancies.

This statement is based on GAO's April 2017 report related to VA facility alignment ( GAO-17-349 ) and numerous GAO reports related to the BRAC process as summarized in a June 2011 testimony ( GAO-11-704T ) and a March 2012 testimony ( GAO-12-513T ). This statement addresses (1) the factors that affect VA's facility alignment and the extent to which VA's capital-planning process facilitates the alignment of facilities with the veterans' population, and (2) the key elements and challenges affecting DOD and the Commission in BRAC 2005. Detailed information on our scope and methodologies for this work can be found in these published products, cited throughout this testimony. Geographic shifts in the veterans' population, changes in health care delivery, aging infrastructure, and limited stakeholder involvement affect the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) efforts to align its services and real property portfolio to meet the needs of veterans. For example, a shift over time from inpatient to outpatient care will likely result in underutilized space once used for inpatient care. Further, the historic status of some VA facilities adds to the complexity of converting or disposing of them. In such instances, it is often difficult and costly for VA to modernize, renovate, and retrofit these older facilities. GAO reported that two of the planning processes VA uses to align its facilities—VA's Strategic Capital Investment Planning (SCIP) and the VA Integrated Planning (VAIP)—have limitations that undermine VA's efforts to achieve its goals. Specifically: VA relies on the SCIP process to plan and prioritize capital projects, but VA routinely asks its facility planners to submit their next year's planned project narratives before knowing if their previous submissions have been funded. The overlapping budget cycle, which is outside of VA's control, combined with other SCIP limitations—including subjective narratives, long time frames, and restricted access to information—make it difficult for VA to rely on SCIP to accurately identify the capital necessary to address its service and infrastructure gaps. VA concurred that it needs to address SCIP limitations that are within its control, as GAO recommended; VA has made some progress in implementing the recommendation has made some progress in implementing the recommendation.\\ The VAIP process is estimated to cost $108 million and to produce market-level service delivery plans and facility master plans. However, the VAIP master plans incorrectly assume that all future growth in services will be provided directly through VA facilities without considering alternatives, such as purchasing care from the community. GAO recommended that VA consider discontinuing the VAIP facility master plans pending an assessment of their value as a facility-planning tool. VA agreed with the recommendation and is implementing it while pursuing a national realignment strategy.. Key elements of the Department of Defense's (DOD) 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process could benefit VA's asset and infrastructure review. The key elements included: (1) establishing goals for the process, (2) developing criteria for evaluating closures and realignments, and (3) establishing an organizational structure to develop closure and realignment options. GAO identified key challenges that affected DOD's implementation of BRAC 2005 and the results achieved; these challenges would need to be addressed if VA is to successfully apply the process. These challenges included: (1) large, complex recommendations required sustained senior leadership's attention and a high level of coordination among many stakeholders, and (2) the large number of actions that depend on each other for successful implementation. In the April 2017 report, GAO made recommendations related to capital planning and stakeholder involvement.

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (VAMC) officials are responsible for reviewing the clinical care delivered by their privileged providers—physicians and dentists who are approved to independently perform specific services—after concerns are raised. The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care. For example, GAO found that after one VAMC failed to report to the NPDB or SLBs a provider who resigned to avoid an adverse privileging action, a non-VA hospital in the same city took an adverse privileging action against that same provider for the same reason 2 years later."], "length": 27285}

{"pred": " Passage 1\nThe passage discusses the concept of price differentiation in consumer markets, where firms charge different prices for the same or similar goods and services based on various factors such as gender, age, or income. The authors analyze data from the Nielsen Company on retail prices paid for 10 personal care product categories, finding that women's versions of personal care products sold at a statistically significant higher average price than men's versions in 5 out of 10 categories. The authors also manually collected prices for 16 pairs of selected personal care products from four online retailers, finding similar price differences. The study suggests that firms may use price differentiation as a strategy to maximize profits by targeting specific consumer segments with higher willingness to pay. The authors also discuss the potential reasons for these price differences, including differences in costs, consumer preferences, and market power. The study highlights the importance of understanding price differentiation in consumer markets and its implications for consumer protection laws.\n\nThe authors also examine the extent to which men and women may face different prices or access in markets for credit and goods and services that are not differentiated based on gender. They review academic literature and find that women may face higher interest rates on mortgage loans and may have less access to small business credit. However, the authors note that these findings are not generalizable and that more research is needed to understand the extent of price differences in these markets.\n\nThe authors also discuss the role of federal agencies in overseeing gender-related price differences, including the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (BCFP), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).

If you want a shorter summary, please", "answers": ["Gender-related price differences occur when consumers are charged different prices for the same or similar goods and services because of factors related to gender. While variation in costs and consumer demand may give rise to such price differences, some policymakers have raised concerns that gender bias may also be a factor. While the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Fair Housing Act prohibit discrimination based on sex in credit and housing transactions, no federal law prohibits businesses from charging consumers different prices for the same or similar goods targeted to different genders. GAO was asked to review gender-related price differences for consumer goods and services sold in the United States. This report examines, among other things, (1) how prices compared for selected goods and services marketed to men and women, and potential reasons for any price differences; (2) what is known about price differences for men and women for products not differentiated by gender, such as mortgages; and (3) the extent to which federal agencies have identified and addressed any concerns about gender-related price differences. To examine these issues, GAO analyzed retail price data, reviewed relevant academic studies, analyzed federal consumer complaint data, and interviewed federal agency officials, industry experts, and academics. Firms differentiate many consumer products to appeal separately to men and women by slightly altering product attributes like color or scent. Products differentiated by gender may sell for different prices if men and women have different demands or willingness to pay for these product attributes. Of 10 personal care product categories (e.g., deodorants and shaving products) that GAO analyzed, average retail prices paid were significantly higher for women's products than for men's in 5 categories. In 2 categories—shaving gel and nondisposable razors—men's versions sold at a significantly higher price. One category—razor blades--had mixed results based on two price measures analyzed, and two others—disposable razors and mass-market perfumes—showed no significant gender price differences. GAO found that the target gender for a product is a significant factor contributing to price differences identified, but GAO did not have sufficient information to determine the extent to which these gender-related price differences were due to gender bias as opposed to other factors, such as different advertising costs. Though the analysis controlled for several observable product attributes, such as product size and packaging type, all underlying differences in costs and demand for products targeted to different genders could not be fully observed. Studies GAO reviewed found limited evidence of gender price differences for four products or services not differentiated by gender—mortgages, small business credit, auto purchases, and auto repairs. For example, with regard to mortgages, women as a group paid higher average mortgage rates than men, in part due to weaker credit characteristics, such as lower average income. However, after controlling for borrower credit characteristics and other factors, three studies did not find statistically significant differences in borrowing costs between men and women, while one found women paid higher rates for certain subprime loans. In addition, one study found that female borrowers defaulted less frequently than male borrowers with similar credit characteristics, and the study suggested that women may pay higher mortgage rates than men relative to their default risk. While these studies controlled for factors other than gender that could affect borrowing costs, several lacked important data on certain borrower risk characteristics, such as credit scores, which could affect analysis of gender disparities. Also, several studies analyzed small samples of subprime loans that were originated in 2005 or earlier, which limits the generalizability of the results. In their oversight of federal antidiscrimination statutes, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, Federal Trade Commission, and Department of Housing and Urban Development have identified limited consumer concerns based on gender-related pricing differences. GAO's analysis of complaint data received by the three agencies from 2012–2017 found that they had received limited consumer complaints about gender-related price differences. The agencies provide general consumer education resources on discrimination and consumer awareness. However, given the limited consumer concern, they have not identified a need to incorporate additional materials specific to gender-related price differences into their existing consumer education resources."], "length": 26637}

The VA's MSPV-NG program office lacked a documented program strategy, leadership stability, and workforce capacity, which hindered the program's success. The program's initial formulary did not meet the needs of medical centers, and the VA delayed the launch of the program to establish non-competitive agreements.

Specifically, it addresses the extent to which VA's implementation of MSPV-NG has been effective in meeting program goals. GAO analyzed VA's requirements development and contracting processes, and identified key supply chain practices cited by four leading hospital networks. GAO also met with contracting and clinical officials at six medical centers, selected based on high dollar contract obligations in fiscal years 2014-2016 and geographic representation. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) established the Medical Surgical Prime Vendor-Next Generation (MSPV-NG) program to provide an efficient, cost-effective way for its facilities to order supplies, but its initial implementation did not have an overarching strategy, stable leadership, and workforce capacity that could have facilitated medical center buy-in for the change.

Further, starting in June 2015, VA planned to award competitive contracts, but instead, 79 percent of the items available for purchase under MSPV-NG were added through non-competitive agreements.

FMAG assistance is similar to other FEMA assistance, with eligible expenses including costs for equipment and supplies, mobilization and demobilization, emergency work, and personal comfort and safety items for firefighter health and safety. The FMAG system has undergone changes, including the amendment of the Stafford Act to make hazard mitigation available for FMAG declarations. The FMAG system is used to provide direct assistance to states to help fight fires on state lands, and it is employed so that a disaster declaration may not be necessary. The FMAG system is not generally available in conjunction with emergency suppression assistance from the Forest Service or other federal agencies engaged in suppression operations. However, FMAGs may be provided in conjunction with other Forest Service assistance programs, such as technical and financial assistance provided through the agency's state and volunteer fire assistance programs or state and private forestry office. The FMAG system has the potential to be used in conjunction with other federal assistance when there is a cooperative agreement between federal, state, and other governmental or tribal partners to coordinate emergency wildfire protection and response activities. Overall, the FMAG system provides critical assistance to states and local governments in fighting wildfires and mitigating their impacts.

The Fed's control over monetary policy stems from its exclusive ability to alter the money supply and credit conditions more broadly. Normally, the Fed conducts monetary policy by setting a target for the federal funds rate, the rate at which banks borrow and lend reserves on an overnight basis. It meets its target through open market operations, financial transactions traditionally involving U.S. Treasury securities. Beginning in 2007, the federal funds target was reduced from 5.25% to a range of 0% to 0.25% in December 2008, which economists call the zero lower bound. By historical standards, rates were kept unusually low for an unusually long time to mitigate the effects of the financial crisis and its aftermath. Starting in December 2015, the Fed has been raising interest rates and expects to gradually raise rates further. The Fed raised rates once in 2016, three times in 2017, and four times in 2018, by 0.25 percentage points each time. In light of increased economic uncertainty and financial volatility, the Fed announced in January 2019 that it would be \"patient\" before raising rates again. The Fed influences interest rates to affect interest-sensitive spending, such as business capital spending on plant and equipment, household spending on consumer durables, and residential investment. In addition, when interest rates diverge between countries, it causes capital flows that affect the exchange rate between foreign currencies and the dollar, which in turn affects spending on exports and imports. Through these channels, monetary policy can be used to stimulate or slow aggregate spending in the short run. In the long run, monetary policy mainly affects inflation. A low and stable rate of inflation promotes price transparency and, thereby, sounder economic decisions. The Fed's relative independence from Congress and the Administration has been justified by many economists on the grounds that it reduces political pressure to make monetary policy decisions that are inconsistent with a long-term focus on stable inflation. But independence reduces accountability to Congress and the Administration, and recent legislation and criticism of the Fed by the President has raised the question about the proper balance between the two. While the federal funds target was at the zero lower bound, the Fed attempted to provide additional stimulus through unsterilized purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities (MBS), a practice popularly referred to as quantitative easing (QE). Between 2009 and 2014, the Fed undertook three rounds of QE. The third round was completed in October 2014, at which point the Fed's balance sheet was $4.5 trillion—five times its precrisis size. After QE ended, the Fed maintained the balance sheet at the same level until September 2017, when it began to very gradually reduce it to a more normal size. The Fed has raised interest rates in the presence of a large balance sheet through the use of two new tools—by paying banks interest on reserves held at the Fed and by engaging in reverse repurchase agreements (reverse repos) through a new overnight facility. In January 2019, the Fed announced that it would continue using these tools to set interest rates permanently, in which case the balance sheet may not get much smaller than its current size of $4 trillion. With regard to its mandate, the Fed believes that unemployment is currently lower than the rate that it considers consistent with maximum employment, and inflation is close to the Fed's 2% goal by the Fed's preferred measure. Even after recent rate increases, monetary policy is still considered expansionary. This monetary policy stance is unusually stimulative compared with policy in this stage of previous expansions, and is being coupled with a stimulative fiscal policy (larger structural budget deficit). Debate is currently focused on how quickly the Fed should raise rates. Some contend the greater risk is that raising rates too slowly at full employment will cause inflation to become too high or cause financial instability, whereas others contend that raising rates too quickly will cause inflation to remain too low and choke off the expansion."], "length": 27283}

The country has experienced economic growth, but the benefits have not been evenly distributed, with many Egyptians facing high inflation and poverty. The government has implemented austerity measures and received IMF support, but the economy remains vulnerable to external shocks. Egypt's military plays a significant role in the economy, with military-owned companies dominating key sectors. The country's foreign policy is focused on regional security and cooperation, with Egypt playing a key role in the Middle East peace process. However, Egypt's human rights record remains a concern, with the government facing criticism for its treatment of minority groups, including Coptic Christians. The US has provided significant economic and military aid to Egypt, but the relationship has been strained due to human rights concerns.

Egypt controls the Suez Canal, which is one of the world's most well-known maritime chokepoints, linking the Mediterranean and Red Seas. Egypt, with its population of more than 100 million people, is by far the most populous Arabic-speaking country. Although it may not play the same type of leading political or military role in the Arab world as it has in the past, Egypt may retain some \"soft power\" by virtue of its history, media, and culture. Cairo plays host both to the 22-member Arab League and Al Azhar University, which claims to be the oldest continuously operating university in the world and has symbolic importance as a leading source of Islamic scholarship. Additionally, Egypt's 1979 peace treaty with Israel remains one of the most significant diplomatic achievements for the promotion of Arab-Israeli peace. While people-to-people relations remain cold, the Israeli and Egyptian governments have increased their cooperation against Islamist militants and instability in the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza Strip. Personnel moves and possible amendments to the Egyptian constitution highlight apparent efforts by President Sisi to consolidate power with the help of political allies, including colleagues from Egypt's security establishment. President Sisi has come under repeated international criticism for an ongoing government crackdown against various forms of political dissent and freedom of expression. The Egyptian government has defended its human rights record, asserting that the country is under pressure from terrorist groups seeking to destabilize Arab nation-states. The Trump Administration has tried to normalize ties with the Sisi government that were generally perceived as strained under President Obama. In January 2019, U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo delivered a major policy speech at the American University in Cairo, where he stated, \"And as we seek an even stronger partnership with Egypt, we encourage President Sisi to unleash the creative energy of Egypt's people, unfetter the economy, and promote a free and open exchange of ideas.\" The United States has provided significant military and economic assistance to Egypt since the late 1970s. Successive U.S. Administrations have justified aid to Egypt as an investment in regional stability, built primarily on long-running cooperation with the Egyptian military and on sustaining the 1979 Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty. All U.S. foreign aid to Egypt (or any recipient) is appropriated and authorized by Congress. Since 1946, the United States has provided Egypt with over $83 billion in bilateral foreign aid (calculated in historical dollars—not adjusted for inflation). Annual appropriations legislation includes several conditions governing the release of these funds. All U.S. military aid to Egypt finances the procurement of weapons systems and services from U.S. defense contractors. For FY2019, Congress has appropriated $1.4 billion in total bilateral assistance for Egypt, the same amount it provided in FY2018. For FY2020, the President is requesting a total of $1.382 billion in bilateral assistance for Egypt. Nearly all of the U.S. funds for Egypt come from the FMF account (military aid). In November 2018, the U.S. Defense Department notified Congress of a major $1 billion sale of defense equipment to Egypt, consisting of 10 AH-64E Apache Attack Helicopters, among other things. Beyond the United States, President Sisi has broadened Egypt's international base of support to include several key partners, including the Arab Gulf states, Israel, Russia, and France.

{"pred": " Passage 1\nCommunity banks and credit unions face significant regulatory burdens, particularly in areas such as mortgage lending, anti-money laundering, and consumer protection. The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) is a major source of burden, with institutions required to collect and report detailed data on mortgage lending activity. The CFPB has taken steps to reduce the burden associated with HMDA, including introducing a new online system for submitting data and exempting small institutions from certain requirements. However, some institutions still find the regulations to be overly complex and time-consuming. The Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering (BSA/AML) regulations also pose significant burdens, particularly in terms of staff time and costs associated with compliance. The CFPB's TRID regulation, which integrates mortgage loan disclosures, has also been criticized for increasing the time and cost of mortgage lending. Federal regulators have taken steps to reduce regulatory burdens, including the EGRPRA review process, which requires regulators to review and revise regulations every 10 years. However, the process has limitations, including the exclusion of CFPB from the review process. The GAO recommends that CFPB assess the effectiveness of its TRID guidance and issue public information on its plans for reviewing regulations. The GAO also recommends that federal regulators conduct and report on quantitative analysis whenever feasible to strengthen the rigor and transparency of the EGRPRA process.

The LWCF Act outlines uses of the fund for federal and state purposes, with at least 40% allocated for federal purposes and 40% for state purposes. Over the years, appropriations for other purposes have varied widely, with some years seeing significant increases in funding. The Forest Legacy Program and Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund have received the largest shares of appropriations for other purposes, with a total of $1.7 billion allocated since FY1998. Other purposes funded by the LWCF include facility maintenance, ecosystem restoration, and the Historic Preservation Fund.

Smaller community banks and credit unions must comply with some of the regulations, but compliance can be more challenging and costly for these institutions. GAO examined (1) the regulations community banks and credit unions viewed as most burdensome and why, and (2) efforts by depository institution regulators to reduce any regulatory burden. GAO analyzed regulations and interviewed more than 60 community banks and credit unions (selected based on asset size and financial activities), regulators, and industry associations and consumer groups. GAO also analyzed letters and transcripts commenting on regulatory burden that regulators prepared responding to the comments. Interviews and focus groups GAO conducted with representatives of over 60 community banks and credit unions indicated regulations for reporting mortgage characteristics, reviewing transactions for potentially illicit activity, and disclosing mortgage terms and costs to consumers were the most burdensome. Institution representatives said these regulations were time-consuming and costly to comply with, in part because the requirements were complex, required individual reports that had to be reviewed for accuracy, or mandated actions within specific timeframes. However, regulators and others noted that the regulations were essential to preventing lending discrimination and use of the banking system for illicit activity, and they were acting to reduce compliance burdens. Institution representatives also said that the new mortgage disclosure regulations increased compliance costs, added significant time to loan closings, and resulted in institutions absorbing costs when others, such as appraisers and inspectors, changed disclosed fees. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) issued guidance and conducted other outreach to educate institutions after issuing these regulations in 2013. But GAO found that some compliance burdens arose from misunderstanding the disclosure regulations—which in turn may have led institutions to take actions not actually required. Assessing the effectiveness of the guidance for the disclosure regulations could help mitigate the misunderstandings and thus also reduce compliance burdens. Regulators of community banks and credit unions—the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the National Credit Union Administration—conduct decennial reviews to obtain industry comments on regulatory burden. But the reviews, conducted under the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996 (EGRPRA), had the following limitations: CFPB and the consumer financial regulations for which it is responsible were not included. Unlike executive branch agencies, the depository institution regulators are not required to analyze and report quantitative-based rationales for their responses to comments. Regulators do not assess the cumulative burden of the regulations they administer. CFPB has formed an internal group that will be tasked with reviewing regulations it administers, but the agency has not publicly announced the scope of regulations included, the timing and frequency of the reviews, and the extent to which they will be coordinated with the other federal banking and credit union regulators as part of their periodic EGRPRA reviews. Congressional intent in mandating that these regulators review their regulations was that the cumulative effect of all federal financial regulations be considered. In addition, sound practices required of other federal agencies require them to analyze and report their assessments when reviewing regulations. Documenting in plans how the depository institution regulators would address these EGRPRA limitations would better ensure that all regulations relevant to community banks and credit unions were reviewed, likely improve the analyses the regulators perform, and potentially result in additional burden reduction. GAO makes a total of 10 recommendations to CFPB and the depository institution regulators. CFPB should assess the effectiveness of guidance on mortgage disclosure regulations and publicly issue its plans for the scope and timing of its regulation reviews and coordinate these with the other regulators' review process. As part of their burden reviews, the depository institution regulators should develop plans to report quantitative rationales for their actions and addressing the cumulative burden of regulations. In written comments, CFPB and the four depository institution regulators generally agreed with the recommendations."], "length": 26862}

The award was originally created by George Washington in 1782 as the Badge of Military Merit, but it fell into disuse. In 1932, General Douglas MacArthur revived the award and renamed it the Purple Heart. The eligibility requirements for the Purple Heart have been expanded several times, including in 1942, 1952, 1962, and 1997. The award is currently authorized for any member of the U.S. Armed Forces who has been wounded or died from wounds sustained under certain conditions, including in combat against an opposing armed force or as a result of an international terrorist attack. The Department of Defense does not maintain a record of the number of Purple Heart recipients, but estimates suggest that over 1 million Purple Hearts have been awarded since 1932. There is ongoing debate about the eligibility criteria for the Purple Heart, particularly with regards to traumatic brain injuries and post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nSummary of Passage 2:\nThe use of opioid medications for pain treatment has led to concerns about addiction and diversion.

{"pred": " Passage 3\nThe Holman rule is a congressional rule that separates questions of policy from questions of funding. It prohibits legislation in appropriation measures, except for retrenchments that reduce expenditures. The rule has been in place since the 19th century, with its language evolving over time. In 1983, the rule was restructured to narrow the exception to the general prohibition against legislation. The rule currently states that a provision changing existing law may not be reported in a general appropriation bill, except for germane provisions that retrench expenditures by reducing amounts of money covered by the bill. The House has interpreted the rule through precedents, incrementally narrowing its application. The rule is intended to apply only when an obvious reduction of funds in a general appropriations bill is achieved by the provision in question. The separate order for the 115th Congress reinstated language that had been stricken from the rule in 1983, opening the door to the consideration of retrenchments resulting from a reduction of the number and salary of the officers of the United States or the reduction of the compensation of any person paid out of the Treasury of the United States. However, the rule does not allow for retrenchments that would be applicable to funds other than those appropriated in the pending general appropriations bill. The Holman rule is not intended to open the door for legislative provisions that would expand the scope of the bill. The House Parliamentarian is the sole definitive authority on questions relating to the chamber's precedents and procedures. The rule has been used to allow for amendments that reduce the number of officers, consolidate or eliminate offices, and cap the salaries of certain employees. However, it has also been used to disallow amendments that would simply confer discretionary authority to terminate employment of federal employees or provide for a reduction of expenditures contingent on an event. The rule is intended to provide a limited exception to the general prohibition in House rules against legislation in appropriation measures. The separate order for the 115th Congress has been used to consider amendments that would reduce the number and salary of officers, reduce the compensation of any person paid out of the Treasury of the United States, or consolidate or eliminate offices. However, the rule does not allow for broad legislative provisions that would apply to the salary or number of federal employees funded through appropriations in other measures. The House has held that a provision that stated no part of an appropriation could be expended for a specific, designated purpose qualified as a retrenchment, but a proposal that effectively repealed the law under which appropriations for that purpose were authorized was held", "answers": ["Although congressional rules establish a general division of responsibility under which questions of policy are kept separate from questions of funding, House rules provide for exceptions in certain circumstances. One such circumstance allows for the inclusion of legislative language in general appropriations bills or amendments thereto for \"germane provisions that retrench expenditures by the reduction of amounts of money covered by the bill.\" This exception appears in clause 2(b) of House Rule XXI and is known as the Holman rule, after Representative William Holman of Indiana, who first proposed the exception in 1876. Since the period immediately after its initial adoption, the House has interpreted the Holman rule through precedents that have tended to incrementally narrow its application. Under current precedents, for a legislative provision or amendment to be in order, the legislative language in question must be both germane to other provisions in the measure and must produce a clear reduction of appropriations in that bill. In addition, the House adopted a separate order during the 115th Congress that provided for retrenchments of expenditures by a reduction of amounts of money covered by the bill to be construed as applying to: any provision or amendment that retrenches expenditures by— (1) the reduction of amounts of money in the bill; (2) the reduction of the number and salary of the officers of the United States; or (3) the reduction of the compensation of any person paid out of the Treasury of the United States.

DOJ's components, including the USAOs, are responsible for overseeing criminal matters, including identifying and notifying victims, determining their losses, and prosecuting cases. The judiciary, including the federal district courts, orders restitution, receives restitution payments, and disburses restitution to victims. The courts use the presentence investigation report (PSR) to determine whether to order restitution. If an offender is released to the community, probation officers are responsible for ensuring the offender abides by the terms of release, including paying any restitution owed to victims. The DOJ's Asset Forfeiture Program allows for the use of forfeited assets to collect restitution debts. However, the process of collecting restitution is often complex and time-consuming, and many offenders lack the ability to pay restitution. The DOJ has identified several practices for prosecutors and FLU staff to use throughout the restitution process, including coordination between prosecutors and case investigators, gathering detailed information on an offender's financial resources, and using the Treasury Offset Program to collect restitution. Despite these efforts, a significant portion of outstanding restitution debt remains uncollectible, and the DOJ has not established performance measures or goals to assess its performance in collecting restitution. The judiciary has also not consistently collected and recorded information on the reasons why restitution was not ordered, which is necessary for USSC to analyze and report on sentencing data.\n\nSummary: Passage 3\nThe rise of e-commerce has led to a shift in the market for counterfeit goods, with counterfeiters now selling goods through primary markets, including e-commerce websites, corporate and government supply chains, and traditional retail stores.

{"pred": " Passage 1\nNeonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) is a condition that affects infants born to mothers who used opioids during pregnancy. The condition can result in a range of symptoms, including respiratory distress, and requires treatment to manage withdrawal symptoms. The passage discusses the current state of NAS treatment, including the use of non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment approaches. Non-pharmacologic treatment, such as rooming-in and breastfeeding, is recommended as the initial approach, while pharmacologic treatment may be necessary for moderate to severe symptoms. The passage also highlights the importance of education and training for healthcare providers on NAS treatment and the need for a national standard of care for screening and treating NAS. The passage concludes by noting that the lack of a comprehensive list of facilities that treat infants with NAS outside of the hospital is a challenge in addressing the condition.\n\nThe passage also discusses the challenges faced by healthcare providers in addressing NAS, including the stigma faced by women who use opioids during pregnancy, the use of multiple substances by pregnant women, and the limited coordination of care for mothers and infants with NAS. The passage notes that the Protecting Our Infants Act: Final Strategy, published by HHS, includes 39 recommendations related to the prevention, treatment, and related services for NAS and prenatal opioid use. However, the passage concludes that HHS lacks a sound plan for implementing these recommendations, which raises questions about whether and when HHS will be able to implement these recommendations in a timely manner and assess its progress.\n\nThe passage also discusses the Medicaid payment for NAS treatment services, noting that most infants with NAS are treated in a hospital setting, often in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), which has a relatively high daily cost of care. The passage concludes that the costs of treating infants with NAS in non-hospital settings were lower than treating them in hospital settings, but supporting data and research on the costs in different settings are limited.\n\nOverall, the passage highlights the need for a comprehensive approach to addressing NAS, including education and training for healthcare providers, a national standard of care for screening and treating NAS, and a sound plan for implementing the recommendations of the Protecting Our Infants Act: Final Strategy. The passage also emphasizes the importance of addressing the challenges faced by healthcare providers in addressing NAS, including the stigma faced by women who use opioids during pregnancy and the limited coordination of care for mothers and infants with NAS. Summary: Passage 2\nThis passage is a transcript of a meeting between a project manager and several team members, including an industrial designer, a", "answers": ["As the opioid crisis has increased in recent years, so has the number of pregnant women who use opioids, which can result in NAS. A recent peer-reviewed study found that cases of NAS have grown nearly five-fold between 2000 and 2012 and that most infants with NAS are covered under Medicaid. The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016 includes a provision for GAO to examine NAS in the United States and related treatment services covered under Medicaid. This report 1) describes the hospital and non-hospital settings for treating infants with NAS and how Medicaid pays for services, 2) describes recommended practices and challenges for addressing NAS, and 3) examines HHS's strategy for addressing NAS. GAO reviewed HHS documentation and interviewed HHS officials. GAO also conducted site visits to four states—Kentucky, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin—selected based on several factors, including incidence rates of NAS and geographic variation. GAO interviewed stakeholders from 32 organizations, including health care providers and state officials in the selected states. The prenatal use of opioids or other drugs can produce a withdrawal condition in newborns known as neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). Health care providers, state officials, and other stakeholders told GAO that most infants with NAS are treated in the hospital—such as in a neonatal intensive care unit—though some may be referred to a non-hospital setting—such as a neonatal withdrawal center with nursery rooms—to complete their treatment. The table below provides more information on settings for treating infants with NAS and on how Medicaid pays for services in these settings. According to stakeholders GAO interviewed and literature reviewed, there are several recommended practices and challenges associated with addressing NAS. The most frequently recommended practices included prioritizing non-pharmacologic treatment to infants—treatment that does not involve medications—such as allowing the mother to reside with the infant during treatment; educating mothers and health care providers on treatment of NAS, among other things; and using a protocol in the hospital or non-hospital setting for screening and treating infants with NAS. The most frequently cited challenges included the maternal use of multiple drugs—or polysubstance use—as it can exacerbate NAS symptoms; stigma faced by pregnant women who use opioids; hospital staff burden and limited physical capacity to care for infants with NAS; limited coordination of care for mothers and infants with NAS; and gaps in research and data on NAS, such as research on the long-term effects of the condition. In May 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published a strategy document that makes key recommendations to address NAS. The Strategy recommends, for example, that health care providers receive continuing education on managing and treating infants with NAS and promote non-pharmacologic treatment. According to HHS officials, these recommendations will inform planning and policy across the department. However, HHS has yet to determine how and when the recommendations will be implemented, including establishing priorities; the roles and responsibilities of other federal, state, and public stakeholders; implementation timeframes; and methods for assessing progress. HHS officials told GAO that they expect to develop an implementation plan sometime in 2017 but had no timeline for doing so. Without a plan that clearly specifies how HHS will implement the Strategy and assess its progress, the department increases the risk that its recommendations for addressing NAS will not be implemented. HHS should expeditiously develop a plan for implementing the recommendations included in its strategy related to addressing NAS. HHS concurred that it should expeditiously address NAS, but noted implementation of the strategy is contingent on funding."], "length": 24678}
{"pred": " Passage 1\nThe Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended by WIOA, authorizes several grant programs to support employment and independent living for individuals with disabilities. The State Vocational Rehabilitation Services program is the primary federal effort to help individuals with disabilities prepare for and obtain employment. State VR agencies work with individuals to develop an individualized plan for employment, which describes the employment goal and the specific services needed to achieve that goal. Education's Rehabilitation Services Administration awards funds to state VR agencies to help individuals with disabilities engage in gainful employment. States must provide a 21.3 percent nonfederal match of these funds. In fiscal year 2016, total program funds for VR, including state match funds, were $3.81 billion. Most state VR agencies reported expanding services for students with disabilities since WIOA's enactment in July 2014 by either serving more students through pre-employment transition services or by initiating new or additional services. Most state VR agencies reported that they provided the five required activities to more students with disabilities since WIOA's enactment. State VR agencies reported developing additional programming as a result of WIOA's enactment, including expanding programs for more students, adding new opportunities and experiences, and creating new partnerships. However, some state VR agencies reported challenges in identifying all potentially eligible students, and agencies for the blind reported fewer students served due to limited resources and age restrictions. State VR agencies reported taking a range of actions to build their administrative capacity to implement pre-employment transition services, including building staff capacity and expanding contracts with service providers. Most state VR agencies reported using less than half of the funds reserved for pre-employment transition services, citing difficulties in using the funds for allowable expenditures. Education officials acknowledged that states would experience challenges in using the funds and provided technical assistance to help states address these challenges. Education officials also stated that they plan to clarify guidance on allowable expenditures as they learn about the issues from states during their monitoring. Overall, the implementation of pre-employment transition services under WIOA has presented challenges for state VR agencies, but many have reported expanding services and developing new programming to support students with disabilities. The Department of Education has provided technical assistance to help states address these challenges, but additional action may be needed to ensure that states efficiently and effectively coordinate services to students with disabilities.

GAO reviewed documents and funding data from Education, and federal laws and regulations; surveyed all 79 state VR agencies (74 responded); held discussion groups with representatives of 29 state VR agencies; and interviewed officials from Education and three states (Idaho, Illinois, and Maryland) GAO selected for variety in size and type of agencies, among other factors. Of the 74 state vocational rehabilitation (VR) agencies that responded to GAO's survey, most reported expanding services to help students with disabilities transition from school to work as required under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), enacted in July 2014. Most state agencies reported serving more students and providing work-based learning experiences and other activities, referred to as pre-employment transition services (see figure). State VR agencies reported two key challenges with implementing pre-employment transition services for students as required by WIOA. Spending reserved funds : States reported spending about $357 million out of the $465 million reserved for these services in fiscal year 2016. Education officials said that states had difficulty determining what expenditures were allowable, and some state officials said they would like more detailed information from Education. Education officials said they plan to clarify guidance but have no timeframe for providing further information, which would help states to better plan their use of reserved funds. Finalizing interagency agreements : Fewer than half the state VR agencies that responded to GAO's survey (34 of 74) reported updating their interagency agreement with their state's educational agency. Interagency agreements can help promote collaboration by, for example, establishing roles and responsibilities of each agency. Although Education offers technical assistance on interagency agreements, without increased efforts to raise awareness about the importance of these agreements and provide assistance to states where needed, Education may miss opportunities to help state VR and educational agencies efficiently and effectively coordinate services. In addition, WIOA requires Education to highlight best state practices, and most VR agencies responding to GAO's survey (63 of 74) reported this would be useful. Education does not have a written plan or timeframe for identifying and disseminating best practices. As a result, Education may miss opportunities to help more students with disabilities successfully transition from school to work. GAO is recommending that Education (1) establish timeframes for providing additional information on allowable expenditures, (2) take additional steps to assist states that have not updated and finalized their interagency agreements, and (3) develop a written plan with specific timeframes and activities for identifying and disseminating best practices. Education agreed with the first recommendation and disagreed with the other two.

The fund also receives mandatory appropriations under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (GOMESA). The level of annual appropriations for the LWCF has varied since the origin of the fund in FY1965. The LWCF Act outlines uses of the fund for federal and state purposes. Of the total made available through appropriations or deposits under GOMESA, not less than 40% is to be used for \"federal purposes\" and not less than 40% is to be used to provide \"financial assistance to states.\" The act lists the federal purposes for which the President is to allot LWCF funds \"unless otherwise allotted in the appropriation Act making them available.\" These purposes primarily relate to acquisition of lands and waters (and interests therein) by the federal government. With regard to state purposes, the act authorizes a matching grant program to states for outdoor recreation purposes. Throughout the LWCF's history, appropriations acts typically have provided funds for land acquisition and outdoor recreational grants to states. Beginning in FY1998, appropriations also have been provided each year (except FY1999) to fund other purposes related to natural resources. The extent to which the LWCF should be used for purposes other than federal land acquisition and outdoor recreation grants to states, and which other purposes should be funded from the LWCF, continue to be the subject of legislation and debate in Congress. In the past few decades, Presidents have sought LWCF funds for a variety of other purposes. Congress chooses which if any of these requests to fund, and has chosen programs not sought by the President for a particular year. Among other programs, appropriations have been provided for facility maintenance of the land management agencies, ecosystem restoration, the Historic Preservation Fund, the Payments in Lieu of Taxes program, the Forest Legacy Program, State and Tribal Wildlife Grants (under the Fish and Wildlife Service), the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund, U.S. Geological Survey science and cooperative programs, and Bureau of Indian Affairs Indian Land and Water Claim Settlements. Since FY1998, a total of $2.7 billion has been appropriated for other purposes, of a total LWCF appropriation of $18.9 billion over the history of the fund. The Fish and Wildlife Service and the Forest Service have received the largest shares of the total appropriations for other purposes, about $1.4 billion (53%) and $1.0.billion (38%), respectively, from FY1998 to FY2019. Several agencies shared the remaining $0.2 billion (9%) of the appropriations. Both the dollar amounts and the percentages of annual LWCF appropriations for other purposes have varied widely since FY1998. The dollar amounts have ranged from $0 in FY1999 to $456.0 million in FY2001. The percentage of annual funds provided for other purposes ranged from 0% in FY1999 to a high of 59% in both FY2006 and FY2007. In some years, the appropriation for other purposes was significantly less than the Administration requested. For instance, for FY2008, the George W.

It also directs the reader to other reports providing context for specific component appropriations. As part of an overall DHS budget that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) estimated to be $74.88 billion, the Trump Administration requested $47.43 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority through the appropriations process for DHS for FY2018. The request amounted to a $0.29 billion (0.6%) decrease from the $47.72 billion in annual appropriations enacted for FY2018 through the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141, Division F). The Administration also requested discretionary funding for DHS components that does not count against discretionary spending limits and is not reflected in the adjusted net discretionary budget authority total. The Administration requested an additional $6.65 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in disaster relief funding, as defined by the Budget Control Act (P.L. 112-25; BCA), and in the budget request for the Department of Defense (DOD), $165 million in Overseas Contingency Operations designated funding (OCO) from the Operations and Maintenance budget of the U.S. Navy. On June 21, 2018, the Senate Committee on Appropriations reported out S. 3109, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2019, accompanied by S.Rept. 115-283. Committee-reported S. 3109 included $48.33 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for FY2019. This was $901 million (1.9%) above the level requested by the Administration, and $611 million (1.3%) above the enacted level for FY2018. The Senate committee-reported bill included the Administration-requested levels for disaster relief funding, and included the OCO funding in an appropriation to the Coast Guard, rather than as a transfer from the U.S. Navy. On July 26, 2018, the House Appropriations Committee marked up H.R. 6776, its version of the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2019. H.Rept. 115-948 was filed September 12, 2018. Committee-reported H.R. 6776 included $51.44 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority. The House committee-reported bill included the Administration-requested levels for disaster relief funding, but unlike S. 3109, did not include the OCO funding for the Coast Guard.

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (VAMC) officials are responsible for reviewing the clinical care delivered by their privileged providers—physicians and dentists who are approved to independently perform specific services—after concerns are raised. The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care.

{"pred": " Passage 1\nThe Buy American Act of 1933 requires the federal government to prefer domestic end products in its procurements. The Act does not apply to products purchased for use outside the United States or obtained through contracts under the micro-purchase threshold. To be considered domestic, end products must be manufactured in the United States, provided that the product is a commercially available off-the-shelf item or the cost of the components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States exceeds 50 percent of the total cost of all components. The Act has several exceptions, including situations where a domestic end product is not produced in sufficient quantities or cases where the cost would be unreasonable to buy a domestic end product. The FAR sets forth several exceptions that permit federal agencies to buy foreign end products. The federal government obligated approximately $7.8 billion for the acquisition of foreign end products in fiscal year 2017, which accounts for less than 5 percent of total federal contract obligations for end products in that year. The data from the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG) shows that the foreign end products in fiscal year 2017 primarily came from South Korea, the United Kingdom, Afghanistan, Canada, Mexico, and the United Arab Emirates. The procurement of foreign end products is permitted by the flexibilities available under the Buy American Act's exceptions and waivers. Agencies also procured foreign end products through means separate from the exceptions allowed under the Buy American Act, primarily in cases where the Act would not apply. The GAO found that agencies may not always input reliable information on the extent to which exceptions or waivers authorized the acquisition of foreign end products in FPDS-NG. The GAO also found that FPDS-NG has system limitations that could hinder complete and accurate reporting of Buy American Act information. The GAO recommends that the Office of Management and Budget instruct the Office of Federal Procurement Policy to facilitate additional training to improve the understanding of the contracting workforce regarding the Buy American Act requirements and to facilitate clarifying revisions to FPDS-NG. The GAO also recommends that the Secretary of Homeland Security clarify existing guidance in the Homeland Security Acquisition Manual or update training to help contracting officials identify the factors that should be considered in order to determine the applicability of the Trade Agreements Act and waiver of the Buy American Act.

The Act permits agencies to buy foreign end products only under certain exceptions, such as when domestic items are not available at a reasonable cost. Further, U.S. trade agreements waive the Buy American restrictions for certain products. GAO was asked to review implementation of the Buy American Act. This report assesses the extent to which (1) the federal government procures foreign products through Buy American Act exceptions and waivers; and (2) selected agencies provide training and guidance to implement the Act. GAO reviewed laws, regulations, and policies related to the Buy American Act and analyzed data for fiscal year 2017 from FPDS-NG. GAO also analyzed a non-generalizable sample of 38 contracts from DOD, HHS, DHS, and VA—the agencies with the most obligations for products in fiscal year 2017. The 38 awards selected include a mix of foreign and domestic products, as well as dollars obligated. Finally, GAO interviewed cognizant contracting and policy officials from the selected agencies. According to data reported in the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG) in fiscal year 2017, foreign end products accounted for less than 5 percent—about $7.8 billion—of federal obligations for products potentially subject to the Buy American Act. Federal agencies procured foreign products using exceptions to Buy American Act requirements, as well as through waivers or when the Buy American Act did not apply, as shown in the figure. The amount of foreign end products purchased could be greater than reported in FPDS-NG, however, due to reporting errors and system limitations. GAO found that 6 of the 38 contracts reviewed from the Departments of Defense (DOD), Health and Human Services (HHS), Homeland Security (DHS), and Veterans Affairs (VA) inaccurately recorded waiver or exception information. FPDS-NG system limitations compound these errors because it does not fully capture Buy American Act data. Among other things, the database does not always enable agencies to report the use of exceptions or waivers on contracts for both foreign and domestic products, reducing data accuracy. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is considering strategies to improve Buy American Act data. The four agencies GAO reviewed varied in their approaches to Buy American Act training and guidance. DOD reports that it will have trained more than 18,000 personnel by the end of 2018. DHS reports training almost 1,400 people—approximately 94 percent of its contracting staff—as of April 2018. Some VA courses mention the Act, but none is focused specifically on implementing its requirements. HHS does not have agency-level training or guidance on the Act. GAO found that contracting officers for the contracts it reviewed face challenges implementing Buy American Act requirements. Having specific and targeted Buy American Act guidance and training can better ensure that agencies meet the Act's requirements. GAO is recommending that OMB take steps to improve Buy American Act data and that HHS, DHS, and VA improve agency guidance and training on implementing the Act.

The issue for Congress is whether to approve, reject, or modify the Navy's proposed FY2020 shipbuilding program and the Navy's longer-term shipbuilding plans. The Navy's 355-ship force-level goal is the largest force-level goal that the Navy has released since a 375-ship force-level goal that was in place in 2002-2004.

By law, each agency is required to follow GSA's disposal process so that an agency's unneeded property can be used by other agencies or certain non-federal entities. Since 2012, agencies have reduced their office and warehouse space due to government-wide initiatives, a reduction that in turn has required agencies to dispose of some affected personal property. GAO was asked to review how federal agencies identify and dispose of unneeded personal property. This report examines (1) how selected agencies assess whether personal property is needed and (2) how these agencies dispose of unneeded property and how, if at all, space reduction efforts have affected disposals. GAO reviewed federal statutes and regulations, and selected five agencies—EPA, Forest Service, GSA, HUD, and IRS—mainly based on space reduction results and goals. GAO reviewed these agencies' property disposal data for 2012 through 2016 and interviewed headquarters and field staff about their property management and disposal processes. The five agencies GAO reviewed—the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Forest Service, General Services Administration (GSA), Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and Internal Revenue Service (IRS)—generally do not have policies or processes for identifying unneeded personal property, such as office furniture, on a proactive basis. Instead, officials from these agencies said they typically identified unneeded property as a result of a “triggering event,” such as an office space reduction. Executive agencies are required by law to continuously review property under their control to identify unneeded personal property and then dispose of it promptly. Without such policies or processes, agencies may not be routinely identifying unneeded property that could be used elsewhere, and efforts to maximize federal personal property use and minimize unnecessary storage costs may not be effective. GSA has issued regulations establishing a government-wide disposal process for unneeded personal property. However, according to GSA officials, the agency lacks the authority to promulgate regulations or formal guidance on management of in-use agency property, and there is no government-wide guidance to agencies on identifying unneeded personal property. Agencies are required to have internal control activities—such as policies and procedures—for reasonable assurance of efficient operations and minimal resource waste, and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provides guidance to agencies on implementing such activities. Guidance from OMB that emphasizes agencies' internal control responsibilities could help ensure that agencies are proactively and regularly identifying property that is no longer needed. The selected agencies reported little difficulty in following GSA's personal property disposal process, reporting over 37,000 items as unneeded property in fiscal years 2012 through 2016. This property was disposed of through transfers to other agencies, donations to authorized recipients, sales, or discarding. When disposing of personal property from space reduction projects at locations GAO visited, agencies also reported using GSA's process (see figure). Overall, agencies said they have not experienced major challenges with disposing of personal property from space reduction efforts. This lack of challenges could be because projects are geographically dispersed and spread over several years.

However, he expressed confidence in the scheme's ability to be rolled out across Wales by 2020. The Minister also discussed the administrative burden on local authorities and the need for a more centralized system, similar to the HM Revenue and Customs model. He stated that the £4.50 single national rate has been welcomed, but acknowledged that it may not be suitable for more expensive areas such as Cardiff and Newport. The Minister emphasized the importance of communicating with parents and providers to ensure the scheme's success.\n\nRegarding the affordability of the service for lowest-income working families, Huw Irranca-Davies acknowledged that the £4.50 rate may not be sufficient for families with higher costs of living, such as those in Cardiff and Newport. He mentioned that the scheme's design allows for add-ons, such as food and transport, which may be charged separately, potentially affecting lower-income families. However, he argued that the scheme is designed to be affordable and that parents are used to making decisions about childcare costs, including add-ons. He also mentioned that the scheme's focus is on providing a universal offer, rather than targeting specific income groups.

Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act) and are available to individuals, states, and nongovernmental entities. The report highlights the Individuals and Households Program (IHP), which provides financial and direct assistance to eligible individuals and households affected by disasters. The IHP has a wide range of eligible uses, including temporary housing assistance, housing repairs, and permanent housing construction. The report also discusses other programs, such as Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA), which provides benefits to individuals rendered jobless as a direct result of a major disaster, and the Disaster Case Management (DCM) program, which partners case managers and disaster survivors to develop and implement Disaster Recovery Plans. Additionally, the report mentions the Public Assistance (PA) Grant Program, which provides grant assistance for state and local governments, and the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP), which provides grants to states for implementing mitigation measures after a disaster. The report concludes that these programs are essential in supporting individuals and communities affected by disasters.\n\nSummary: Passage 2\nThe Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is a federal program that provides food assistance to low-income individuals and families. The program has various work requirements, including registering for work, reporting to an employer, and participating in a SNAP Employment and Training (E&T) program. However, many SNAP recipients are exempt from these requirements, including children, the elderly, and individuals with disabilities. The program also has a time limit for able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWDs), who must work or participate in a work program for 20 hours or more per week to receive benefits. The report highlights the challenges faced by states in implementing the SNAP E&T program, including limited funding and inadequate staffing. The report also notes that the program has seen a decline in participation in recent years, with the percentage of total SNAP recipients participating in SNAP E&T programs decreasing from 0.9% to 0.5% from fiscal year 2008 to 2016.

A number of federal agencies provide financial assistance through grants, loans, and loan guarantees to assist in the provision of critical services, such as temporary housing, counseling, and infrastructure repair. The programs summarized in this report fall into two broad categories. First, there are programs specifically authorized for use during situations occurring because of a disaster. Most of these programs are administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Second are general assistance programs that in some instances may be used either in disaster situations or to meet other needs unrelated to a disaster.

The program is using an Agile software development approach, which involves rapid delivery of software in small, short increments. However, the program has experienced significant delays and complexities, including issues with data migration and the Agile development contract. The GAO found that FEMA's initial cost estimate was reliable, but key assumptions about the program had changed since the initial estimate, making it no longer reflective of the current approach. The GAO also found that FEMA's schedule to fully deliver GMM by September 2020 is aggressive and unrealistic. The program's unreliable schedule and lack of a robust schedule to forecast its development activities limit its ability to make informed decisions on what additional increases in cost or reductions in scope might be needed to achieve its goals. The GAO made eight recommendations to FEMA to address these issues.\n\nPassage 2 discusses the Interagency Security Committee's (ISC) risk management standard for identifying necessary countermeasures for federal facilities. The ISC standard requires agencies to assess all undesirable events, consider all three factors of risk (threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences), and document deviations from the standard. However, the GAO found that four selected agencies (CBP, FAA, ARS, and the Forest Service) did not fully align with the ISC standard. The agencies had not updated their policies and procedures to require a methodology that adheres to the ISC standard, and they lacked the means to collect, store, and analyze risk assessment information to monitor the status of a facility's security. The GAO recommended that the agencies take actions to address these issues, including updating their policies and procedures, implementing a long-term assessment schedule, and collecting and analyzing risk assessment information. The agencies agreed with the GAO's recommendations and provided plans for implementation. The GAO also found that agencies faced challenges in conducting timely assessments, including backlogs and insufficient resources. The GAO recommended that the agencies address these challenges and develop a feasible time frame for completing the assessment backlog. The agencies agreed with the GAO's recommendations and provided plans for implementation. The GAO's report highlights the importance of agencies following the ISC standard to ensure the security of their facilities and the need for agencies to address the challenges they face in conducting physical security assessments and monitoring results. The GAO's recommendations aim to improve the agencies' physical security programs and ensure that they are aligned with the ISC standard.", "answers": ["Protecting federal employees and facilities from security threats is of critical importance. Most federal agencies are generally responsible for their facilities and have physical security programs to do so. GAO was asked to examine how federal agencies assess facilities' security risks. This report examines: (1) how selected agencies' assessment methodologies align with the ISC's risk management standard for identifying necessary countermeasures and (2) what management challenges, if any, selected agencies reported facing in conducting physical security assessments and monitoring the results. GAO selected four agencies—CBP, FAA, ARS, and the Forest Service—based on their large number of facilities and compared each agency's assessment methodology to the ISC Standard; analyzed facility assessment schedules and results from 2010 through 2016; and interviewed security officials. GAO also visited 13 facilities from these four agencies, selected based on geographical dispersion and their high risk level. None of the four agencies GAO reviewed—U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), and the Forest Service—used security assessment methodologies that fully aligned with the Interagency Security Committee's Risk Management Process for Federal Facilities standard (the ISC Standard). This standard requires that methodologies used to identify necessary facility countermeasures—such as fences and closed-circuit televisions—must: 1. Consider all of the undesirable events (i.e., arson and vandalism) identified by the ISC Standard as possible risks to facilities. 2. Assess three factors—threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences—for each of these events and use these three factors to measure risk. All four agencies used methodologies that included some ISC requirements when conducting assessments. CBP and FAA assessed vulnerabilities but not threats and consequences. ARS and the Forest Service assessed threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences, but did not use these factors to measure risk. In addition, the agencies considered many, but not all 33 undesirable events related to physical security as possible risks to their facilities. Agencies are taking steps to improve their methodologies. For example, ARS and the Forest Service now use a methodology that measures risk and plan to incorporate the methodology into policy. Although CBP and FAA have updated their methodologies, their policies do not require methodologies that fully align with the ISC standard. As a result, these agencies miss the opportunity for a more informed assessment of the risk to their facilities. All four agencies reported facing management challenges in conducting physical security assessments or monitoring assessment results. Specifically, CBP, ARS, and the Forest Service have not met the ISC's required time frame of every 3 years for conducting assessments. For example, security specialists have not conducted required reassessments of two ARS and one Forest Service higher-level facilities. While these three agencies have plans to address backlogs, CBP's plan does not balance conducting risk assessments with other competing security priorities, such as updating its policy manual, and ARS and the Forest Service lack a means to monitor completion of future assessments. Furthermore, CBP, ARS, and the Forest Service did not have the data or information systems to monitor assessment schedules or the status of countermeasures at facilities, and their policies did not specify such data requirements. For example, ARS and the Forest Service do not collect and analyze security-related data, such as countermeasures' implementation. FAA does not routinely monitor the performance of its physical security program. Without improved monitoring, agencies are not well equipped to prioritize their highest security needs, may leave facilities' vulnerabilities unaddressed, and may not take corrective actions to meet physical security program objectives. This is a public version of a sensitive report that GAO issued in August 2017. Information that the agencies under review deemed sensitive has been omitted. GAO recommends: (1) that CBP and FAA update policies to require the use of methodologies fully aligned with the ISC Standard; (2) that CBP revise its plan to eliminate the assessments backlog; and (3) that all four agencies improve monitoring of their physical security programs.

The General Services Administration (GSA) assists agencies in disposing of personal property and has established a government-wide personal-property disposal process. Agencies are required to maintain adequate inventory controls and accountability systems for property under their control, and to continually survey property to identify excess. The GSA's disposal process involves four potential property disposal methods: transfer to another federal agency or certain non-federal entities, donation, sale, and abandonment or destruction. Agencies are also required to use existing agency property or obtain excess property from other federal agencies before purchasing new property. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is responsible for establishing government-wide management policies and requirements for personal property. The OMB has issued guidance for specific types of personal property, such as government aircraft and information technology systems.

By law, each agency is required to follow GSA's disposal process so that an agency's unneeded property can be used by other agencies or certain non-federal entities. Since 2012, agencies have reduced their office and warehouse space due to government-wide initiatives, a reduction that in turn has required agencies to dispose of some affected personal property. GAO was asked to review how federal agencies identify and dispose of unneeded personal property. This report examines (1) how selected agencies assess whether personal property is needed and (2) how these agencies dispose of unneeded property and how, if at all, space reduction efforts have affected disposals. GAO reviewed federal statutes and regulations, and selected five agencies—EPA, Forest Service, GSA, HUD, and IRS—mainly based on space reduction results and goals. GAO reviewed these agencies' property disposal data for 2012 through 2016 and interviewed headquarters and field staff about their property management and disposal processes. The five agencies GAO reviewed—the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Forest Service, General Services Administration (GSA), Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and Internal Revenue Service (IRS)—generally do not have policies or processes for identifying unneeded personal property, such as office furniture, on a proactive basis. Instead, officials from these agencies said they typically identified unneeded property as a result of a “triggering event,” such as an office space reduction. Executive agencies are required by law to continuously review property under their control to identify unneeded personal property and then dispose of it promptly. Without such policies or processes, agencies may not be routinely identifying unneeded property that could be used elsewhere, and efforts to maximize federal personal property use and minimize unnecessary storage costs may not be effective. GSA has issued regulations establishing a government-wide disposal process for unneeded personal property. However, according to GSA officials, the agency lacks the authority to promulgate regulations or formal guidance on management of in-use agency property, and there is no government-wide guidance to agencies on identifying unneeded personal property. Agencies are required to have internal control activities—such as policies and procedures—for reasonable assurance of efficient operations and minimal resource waste, and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provides guidance to agencies on implementing such activities. Guidance from OMB that emphasizes agencies' internal control responsibilities could help ensure that agencies are proactively and regularly identifying property that is no longer needed. The selected agencies reported little difficulty in following GSA's personal property disposal process, reporting over 37,000 items as unneeded property in fiscal years 2012 through 2016. This property was disposed of through transfers to other agencies, donations to authorized recipients, sales, or discarding. When disposing of personal property from space reduction projects at locations GAO visited, agencies also reported using GSA's process (see figure). Overall, agencies said they have not experienced major challenges with disposing of personal property from space reduction efforts. This lack of challenges could be because projects are geographically dispersed and spread over several years.

The NRC has set dose limits for radiation exposure, which are below the level considered low dose by the National Academies. The agencies have also applied the principle that doses should be kept as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA). However, the effects of low-dose radiation are more difficult to detect, and data do not definitively establish the dose-response relationship between cancer and radiation exposure below 100 millisieverts (mSv). The agencies have funded research on the health effects of low-dose radiation, but funding has decreased over the past five years. The GAO recommends that the Secretary of Energy lead the development of a mechanism for interagency collaboration to determine roles and responsibilities for addressing priorities related to research on the health effects of low-dose radiation.

The Department of Energy (DOE), Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Food and Drug Administration generally used the advice of scientific advisory bodies to develop and apply radiation protection requirements and guidance for workers and the public in the radiation exposure settings that GAO reviewed. These settings were: (1) the operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants; (2) the cleanup of sites with radiological contamination; (3) the use of medical equipment that produces radiation; and (4) accidental or terrorism-related exposure to radiation. Specifically, the agencies relied on the advice of three scientific advisory bodies that supported the use of a model that assumes the risk of cancer increases with every incremental radiation exposure. Accordingly, the agencies have set regulatory dose limits and issued guidance to confine exposure to levels that reduce the risk of cancer, while recognizing that scientific uncertainties occur in estimating cancer risks from low-dose radiation. For example, NRC requires nuclear power plants to consider measures for limiting workers' exposure below NRC's regulatory dose limit, such as by using robots for maintenance work in radiation areas. GAO identified seven federal agencies that funded research on low-dose radiation's health effects. In fiscal years 2012 to 2016, DOE, NRC, EPA, and four other federal agencies obligated about $210 million for such research . Although the agencies have collaborated on individual projects on radiation's health effects, they have not established a collaborative mechanism to set research priorities. GAO's previous work has shown that federal agencies can use such mechanisms to implement interagency collaboration to develop and coordinate sound science policies. In the past, DOE took a leading role in this area because DOE provided stable funding and advocated for greater coordination on research on low-dose radiation's health effects. However, since fiscal year 2012, DOE has phased out funding for one of its main research programs in this area. This has created a void in coordination efforts among federal agencies, and no other agency has stepped forward to fill this void. Because of DOE's prior experience as a leader in this area of research and its research responsibility under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, it could play an important role in helping federal agencies establish a coordinating mechanism for low-dose radiation research.

The use of OCO/GWOT funding has become a contentious issue, with some arguing it enables a flexible and timely response to emergencies and provides a fiscal safety valve to the Budget Control Act (BCA) caps, while others see it as a \"slush fund\" for military and foreign affairs spending unrelated to contingency operations. The OCO account has been used for a wide range of activities, including base-budget requirements, and the criteria for determining which activities are eligible for OCO funding are often debated. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that OCO funding for DOD enduring activities, those that would continue in the absence of overseas conflicts, totals more than $50 billion a year, and the National Defense Strategy Commission recommends gradually integrating OCO spending back into the base Pentagon budget. The Trump Administration has proposed returning to OCO's original purpose by shifting certain costs funded in OCO to the base budget, but the future of OCO funding remains uncertain. The BCA caps on discretionary spending have been raised several times, and the Administration's FY2019 budget request projected increasing defense spending in FY2020 and FY2021 beyond the statutory limits of the BCA. The use of OCO funding has created uncertainty in defense planning and has been criticized for undermining budget controls and contributing to larger deficits. The alternative, transitioning longer-term OCO expenses to the base budget, could be achieved through a combination of increased budget caps, targeted cuts in inefficient Defense programs, and increased revenues. The National Defense Strategy Commission has recommended that Congress increase the defense budget between 3% and 5% a year above inflation to meet U.S. strategic goals. The future of OCO funding will depend on the outcome of the 116th Congress's decisions on the BCA caps and the defense budget. The use of OCO funding has become a contentious issue, with some arguing it enables a flexible and timely response to emergencies and provides a fiscal safety valve to the BCA caps,", "answers": ["Congressional interest in Overseas Contingency Operation (OCO) funding has continued as Members debate ways of funding priorities without breaching discretionary spending limits set in law. Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Congress has appropriated approximately $2 trillion in discretionary budget authority designated as emergency requirements or for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism (OCO/GWOT) in support of the broad U.S. government response to the 9/11 attacks and for other related international affairs activities. This figure amounts to approximately 9.4% of total discretionary spending during this period. Congress has used supplemental appropriation acts or designated funding for emergency requirements or OCO/GWOT—or both—in statute. These funds are not subject to limits on discretionary spending in congressional budget resolutions or to the statutory discretionary spending limits established by the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-125). The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (BBEDCA; P.L. 99-177) allows emergency funding to be excluded from budget control limits. The BCA added the OCO/GWOT designation to the BBEDCA exemption, thereby providing Congress and the President with an alternate way to exclude funding from the BCA spending limits. While there is no overall statutory limit on the amount of emergency or OCO/GWOT spending, both Congress and the President have fundamental roles in determining how much of the spending to provide each fiscal year. Congress must designate any such funding in statute on an account-by-account basis. The President is also required to designate it as such after it is appropriated to be available for expenditure. Debate over what should constitute OCO/GWOT or emergency activities and expenses has shifted over time, reflecting differing viewpoints about the extent, nature, and duration of U.S. military operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere. Funding designated for OCO/GWOT has also been used to fund base-budget requirements of the DOD and State Department and to prevent or respond to crises abroad, including armed conflict, as well as human-caused and natural disasters. Some defense officials and policymakers argue OCO funding allows for flexible response to contingencies, and provides a \"safety valve\" to the spending caps and threat of sequestration—the automatic cancellation of budget authority largely through across-the-board reductions of nonexempt programs and activities—under the BCA. Critics, however, have described OCO/GWOT as a loophole or \"gimmick\"—morphing from an account for replacing combat losses of equipment, resupplying expended munitions, and transporting troops through war zones, to a \"slush fund\" for activities unrelated to contingency operations. Congress appropriated approximately $103 billion for OCO in FY2017 (8.5% of all discretionary appropriations), $78 billion for OCO in FY2018 (5.5% of all discretionary appropriations), and $68.8 billion for OCO so far in FY2019. Discretionary appropriations for FY2019 are not yet final; a continuing resolution expired December 21, 2018. Following passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-123), which raised discretionary budget caps for defense and foreign affairs agencies in FY2018 and FY2019, the Administration proposed shifting some OCO funding into the base, or regular, budget. Although Congress has generally not followed Administration requests for reduced funding for foreign affairs and domestic activities and has increased funding for defense, the President has asked cabinet secretaries to propose spending cuts of 5% in FY2020. Such proposals, if requested in a budget submission, may create difficult choices for Congress in FY2020 and FY2021—the final two years of the BCA discretionary spending limits. Congress's decisions on OCO/GWOT designations will affect how much agency funding is available for military operations and foreign affairs activities overseas, how much is subject to the BCA caps, and how much is incorporated into regular budgets and long-term budget projections."], "length": 25563}
{"pred": " Passage 2\nThe U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) has been working to enhance its global defense posture in Europe through the European Reassurance Initiative (ERI). ERI aims to deter Russian aggression and develop the capacity to field a credible combined force in the event of deterrence failure. DOD has requested increased funding for ERI, with a total of approximately $4.5 billion requested for posture enhancements through the end of fiscal year 2017. However, DOD's planning for ERI's posture initiatives does not establish priorities for ERI initiatives relative to those funded in the base budget, estimate long-term sustainment costs for some posture initiatives funded under ERI, or communicate future ERI costs to Congress. This lack of planning and transparency poses risks for DOD, including making decisions without a strategic vision and funding initiatives that cannot be sustained over the long term. To address these risks, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense prioritize posture initiatives under ERI relative to those funded in the base budget, direct EUCOM and the military services to develop estimates for the sustainment costs of prepositioned equipment and other infrastructure projects under ERI, and provide Congress with estimates of the future costs for posture initiatives funded under ERI and other enduring costs. DOD partially concurred with our recommendations, but we believe that DOD could improve its planning for posture initiatives funded under ERI by using DOD's established posture-planning processes. The Army and Air Force identified approximately $224 million in unspecified minor military construction and facilities maintenance and repair projects that were programmed or obligated for the European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) in fiscal years 2015 through 2017. DOD has not provided Congress with projections of future costs for posture initiatives funded under ERI and information on its assumptions pertaining to host nation support and burden sharing, which limits congressional visibility into the resources needed to achieve ERI's objectives. Russia's annexation of Crimea and the subsequent threat of further aggression led DOD to establish and expand ERI's objectives and enhance posture in Europe to support a new U.S. strategy toward Russia. DOD has requested funding for these enhancements using its OCO budget, but the processes DOD uses to develop its OCO budget were not designed to plan for and fund long-term, enduring initiatives such as ERI. By following a separate planning process when funding ERI with OCO, DOD is taking on risk by not reviewing and prioritizing ERI posture plans against other posture initiatives, estimating the costs for", "answers": ["In response to Russia's annexation of Crimea in March 2014, the President announced the ERI, to reassure allies in Europe of U.S. commitment to their security. This initiative has been funded using OCO appropriations, which Congress provides in addition to DOD's base budget appropriations. The Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying the Continuing Appropriations and Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017, included a provision for GAO to review matters related to ERI. In this report, we (1) describe changes in ERI's objectives, funding under ERI, and DOD's posture in Europe since 2014 and (2) evaluate the extent to which DOD's planning processes for posture initiatives funded under ERI prioritize those initiatives, estimate their long-term costs, and communicate their estimated costs to Congress. GAO analyzed DOD strategy documentation, budget and cost analysis guidance, budget justification materials, and cost and obligations data. GAO also interviewed knowledgeable officials within the Office of the Secretary of Defense, U.S. European Command, the military services, and the State Department. Since 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) has expanded the European Reassurance Initiative's (ERI) objectives, increased its funding, and planned enhancements to European posture. DOD expanded ERI's objectives from the short-term reassurance of allies and partners to include deterring Russian aggression in the long term and developing the capacity to field a credible combined force should deterrence fail. With respect to funding, DOD will have requested approximately $4.5 billion for ERI's posture enhancements through the end of fiscal year 2017 (about $3.2 billion for fiscal year 2017 alone), and in July 2016 EUCOM identified funding needs for future posture initiatives. The expansion of ERI's objectives has contributed to DOD's enhancing its posture in Europe. Specifically, DOD has increased the size and duration of Army combat unit deployments, planned to preposition Army equipment in Eastern Europe, added new enduring locations (e.g., locations that DOD expects to access and use to support U.S. security interests for the foreseeable future), improved infrastructure, and negotiated new agreements with European nations. As of April 2017, DOD was considering further force enhancements under ERI as part of the department's ERI budget request. DOD also was reviewing whether new enduring locations to support ERI were needed and was considering other improvements to existing infrastructure. DOD's process for planning ERI has not established priorities among posture initiatives funded under ERI relative to those in its base budget, nor estimated long-term sustainment costs for some posture initiatives funded under ERI, nor communicated future costs to Congress. ERI is being planned using a separate process from DOD's established processes and is funded from DOD's overseas contingency operations (OCO) appropriations. GAO found several weaknesses: Lack of prioritization : DOD establishes priorities among ERI posture initiatives but has not evaluated them against base budget initiatives using its posture management process. As a result, DOD lacks an understanding of the relative importance of ERI initiatives and may be investing in projects that it will not continue should OCO funding become unavailable. Lack of sustainment costs : EUCOM and the military services have not fully estimated the long-term costs to sustain equipment and construction funded under ERI. Based on DOD's approach for calculating rough order sustainment costs, GAO determined that these costs could be substantial. DOD officials said that GAO correctly applied DOD's approach for estimating sustainment costs, but noted that actual costs may be lower, because the military services may not fully fund sustainment. In the absence of comprehensive estimates, DOD has been limited in its ability to assess affordability and plan for future costs. Not communicating future costs : DOD limits Congress's visibility into the resources needed to implement ERI and achieve its objectives because it does not include future costs in its ERI budget request. This is a public version of a classified report issued in August 2017. Information on specific posture planning, guidance, and budget estimates that DOD deemed to be classified have been omitted from this report. GAO recommends that DOD prioritize ERI posture initiatives against initiatives in its base budget, develop cost estimates for sustaining initiatives, and communicate future costs to Congress.

{"pred": " Passage 2\nThe Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant is a federal program that provides funding to states for various social services, including cash assistance, child care, and work-related activities. The program has undergone several changes since its inception in 1996, including a reduction in the block grant amount and the introduction of a contingency fund. In FY2017, TANF expenditures totaled $31.1 billion, with the majority going towards basic assistance, child care, and work-related activities. The program also helps low-wage parents through state refundable tax credits and contributes to the child welfare system. However, the program's funding has been reduced over time, with the real value of the block grant declining by one-third since its inception. The TANF work participation standard requires states to have 50% of their caseload meet work or activity standards, but this standard can be lowered by a caseload reduction credit. In FY2017, 16 states did not meet the all-families work participation standard, but this number declined to two in FY2017. The program's effectiveness is measured by its ability to reduce poverty and promote self-sufficiency, but its impact is limited by its funding constraints and the complexity of the program's rules and regulations. Overall, the TANF block grant is a critical component of the social safety net, but its limitations and challenges must be addressed to ensure its effectiveness in supporting low-income families. The program's funding and rules have been subject to various changes and updates, including the 2019 proposed rule, which would increase the salary level threshold for the EAP exemptions and expand overtime coverage to EAP employees. The proposed rule would affect approximately 4.9 million workers, with 1.3 million becoming newly entitled to overtime pay and 3.6 million receiving strengthened overtime protections. The rule would also establish a new salary level for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and for the motion picture industry. The future salary level updates would be based on the same data source and methodology as the 2019 proposed rule. The proposed rule would expand overtime coverage to EAP employees through a higher salary level threshold rather than through additional classes of employees. The estimated numbers of affected workers under the 2019 proposed rule and the 2016 final rule are provided in Table 2. The proposed rule would implement a commitment by DOL to update the EAP salary level thresholds every four years", "answers": ["The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant funds a wide range of benefits and services for low-income families with children. TANF was created in the 1996 welfare reform law (P.L. 104-193). This report responds to some frequently asked questions about TANF; it does not describe TANF rules (see, instead, CRS Report RL32748, The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Block Grant: A Primer on TANF Financing and Federal Requirements, by Gene Falk). TANF Funding and Expenditures. TANF provides fixed funding for the 50 states, the District of Columbia, the territories, and American Indian tribes. The basic block grant totals $16.5 billion per year. States are also required in total to contribute, from their own funds, at least $10.3 billion annually under a maintenance-of-effort (MOE) requirement. Though TANF is best known for funding cash assistance payments for needy families with children, the block grant and MOE funds are used for a wide variety of benefits and activities. In FY2017, expenditures on basic assistance totaled $7.1 billion—23% of total federal TANF and MOE dollars. Basic assistance is often—but not exclusively—paid as cash. In addition to funding basic assistance, TANF also contributes funds for child care and services for children who have been, or are at risk of being, abused and neglected. Some states also count expenditures in prekindergarten programs toward the MOE requirement. The TANF Assistance Caseload. A total of 1.2 million families, composed of 3.1 million recipients, received TANF- or MOE-funded assistance in September 2018. The bulk of the \"recipients\" were children—2.3 million in that month. The assistance caseload is heterogeneous. The type of family once thought of as the \"typical\" assistance family—one with an unemployed adult recipient—accounted for 32% of all families on the rolls in FY2016. Additionally, 31% of cash assistance families had an employed adult, while 38% of all TANF families were \"child-only\" and had no adult recipient. Child-only families include those with disabled adults receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI), adults who are nonparents (e.g., grandparents, aunts, uncles) caring for children, and families consisting of citizen children and ineligible noncitizen parents. Cash Assistance Benefits. TANF cash benefit amounts are set by states. In July 2017, the maximum monthly benefit for a family of three ranged from $1,021 in New Hampshire to $170 in Mississippi. Only New Hampshire (at 60% of the federal poverty guidelines) had a maximum TANF cash assistance amount for this sized family in excess of 50% of poverty-level income. Work Requirements. TANF's main federal work requirement is actually a performance measure that applies to the states. States determine the work rules that apply to individual recipients. TANF law requires states to engage 50% of all families and 90% of two-parent families with work-eligible individuals in work activities, though these standards can be reduced by \"credits.\" Therefore, the effective standards states face are often less than the 50% or 90% targets, and vary by state. In FY2017, states achieved, on average, an all-family participation rate of 53.0% and a two-parent rate of 69.5%. In FY2017, two jurisdictions did not meet the all-family participation standard: Nevada and Guam. This is a reduction from FY2012, when 16 states did not meet that standard. In FY2017, nine jurisdictions did not meet the two-parent standard. States that do not meet work standards are at risk of being penalized by a reduction in their block grant."], "length": 26985}

The Minister for Children and Social Care, Huw Irranca-Davies, notes that the bureaucracy around the current approach is a significant issue, particularly in dealing with parents and families with complex backgrounds. The administrative burden on local authorities is also a concern, with parents needing to provide wage slips, birth certificates, and other documents to prove eligibility. The Minister suggests that a centralized system, similar to HM Revenue and Customs, would be more efficient and effective. The early implementer areas have shown that the intensity of demand for the services is not spread evenly across, with some areas experiencing higher demand than others. The Minister attributes this to economic and cultural issues, such as family traditions of providing childcare within families. The discussion also touches on the issue of grandparents providing childcare, with the Minister stating that the childcare offer is not intended to provide a subsidy to unregistered grandparents. The Minister is confident that the childcare offer will be delivered by 2020, with a phased roll-out and lessons learned from the early implementer areas. The discussion highlights the complexities and challenges of implementing the childcare offer, but also the potential benefits and positive outcomes for families and children.  The Minister also notes that the childcare offer is not a pure market-driven rate, but rather an open dialogue with the sector to determine what is affordable for the Welsh Government. The Minister is open to revising the rate in the future if necessary, and is confident that the funding available will be sufficient to deliver the childcare offer.

{"pred": " Passage 1\nThe Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is a government agency that insures private mortgage lenders against borrower default. To be eligible for FHA insurance, the mortgage must be originated by a lender approved by FHA, and the mortgage and borrower must meet certain criteria. The FHA plays a countercyclical role in the mortgage market, insuring more mortgages when the market is weak and fewer when it is strong. FHA-insured loans have lower down payment requirements and less stringent credit history requirements than conventional loans. The agency has a long history, dating back to 1934, and has been instrumental in making homeownership more accessible to low- and moderate-income households. The FHA's market share has fluctuated over the years, peaking at over 30% of home-purchase mortgages in 2009 and 2010, and decreasing somewhat since then. The agency's financial status is closely tied to the health of the mortgage market, and it has taken steps to strengthen the insurance fund, including increasing mortgage insurance premiums and strengthening underwriting requirements.\n\nSummary: Passage 2\nCross-border data flows are essential to international trade and commerce, enabling companies to transmit information, track global supply chains, and provide cross-border services. However, they also raise concerns around security and privacy. The United States has traditionally supported open data flows, but other countries are developing data privacy policies that affect international trade. The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a comprehensive privacy regime that grants new rights to individuals and creates specific data protection requirements. The GDPR applies to businesses and organizations that process personal data of individuals in the EU, regardless of where the actual processing takes place. The EU is actively promoting the GDPR, and some countries, such as Argentina, are imitating its rules. The United States has traditionally sought a balanced approach between trade, privacy, and security, but there is no single U.S. data privacy policy. The Trump Administration is seeking to define an overarching U.S. policy on data privacy, and Congress may consider comprehensive legislation. The OECD guidelines, G-20 principles, APEC CBPR, CPTPP, and USMCA provisions demonstrate an evolving understanding on how to balance cross-border data flows, security, and privacy.\n\nSummary: Passage 3\nThe Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund (RHB Fund) is facing a financial shortfall, with a projected depletion date of 2030.

FHA insures private lenders against the possibility of borrowers defaulting on mortgages that meet certain criteria, thereby expanding the availability of mortgage credit beyond what may be available otherwise. If the borrower defaults on the mortgage, FHA is to repay the lender the remaining amount owed. A household that obtains an FHA-insured mortgage must meet FHA's eligibility and underwriting standards, including showing that it has sufficient income to repay a mortgage. FHA requires a minimum down payment of 3.5% from most borrowers, which is lower than the down payment required for many other types of mortgages. FHA-insured mortgages cannot exceed a statutory maximum mortgage amount, which varies by area and is based on area median house prices but cannot exceed a specified ceiling in high-cost areas. (The ceiling is set at $726,525 in high-cost areas in calendar year 2019.) Borrowers are charged fees, called mortgage insurance premiums, in exchange for the insurance. In FY2018, FHA insured over 1 million new mortgages (including both home purchase and refinance mortgages) with a combined principal balance of $209 billion. FHA's share of the mortgage market tends to vary with economic conditions and other factors. In the aftermath of the housing market turmoil that began around 2007 and a related contraction of mortgage lending, FHA insured a larger share of mortgages than it had in the preceding years. Its overall share of the mortgage market increased from about 3% in calendar year 2005 to a peak of 21% in 2009. Since that time, FHA's share of the mortgage market has decreased somewhat, though it remains higher than it was in the early 2000s. In calendar year 2017, FHA's overall share of the mortgage market was about 17%. FHA-insured mortgages, like all mortgages, experienced increased default rates during the housing downturn that began around 2007, leading to concerns about the stability of the FHA insurance fund for single-family mortgages, the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMI Fund). In response to these concerns, FHA adopted a number of policy changes in an attempt to limit risk to the MMI Fund.

{"pred": " Passage 2\nThe Commercial Space Launch Act Amendments of 1988 established the foundation for the U.S. policy to provide federal payment for a portion of claims by third parties for injury, damage, or loss resulting from a commercial launch or reentry accident. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) calculates the maximum probable loss (MPL) value, which is the greatest dollar amount of loss to third parties and the federal government that can be reasonably expected from a launch or reentry accident. The FAA's MPL methodology has undergone revisions, including the adoption of the risk profile method in 2016, which estimates the number of potential casualties and property damage. However, the agency has not fully addressed the requirements of the Commercial Space Launch Act, including ensuring a balance of risk between launch companies and the federal government, considering the cost impact of implementing an updated MPL methodology, and consulting with the commercial space sector and insurance providers. The FAA's MPL methodology has weaknesses, including an understated cost-of-casualty amount, which can lead to inaccurate loss calculations and increased potential exposure to the federal government. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommends that the FAA Administrator fulfill the requirements of the Commercial Space Launch Act and address the weaknesses in the MPL methodology. The GAO also recommends that the FAA establish an estimated completion date for developing and implementing a plan to establish guidance on the most appropriate MPL methodologies and tools to use for each launch. The FAA has not updated the cost-of-casualty amount since 1988, and the agency has not consulted with launch providers and insurance companies to evaluate the effects on key potential costs to launch companies and the federal government. The GAO's recommendations aim to improve the FAA's MPL methodology and ensure that the federal government is not exposed to greater liability costs than intended. The FAA has begun improving other aspects of its MPL process, but important actions remain incomplete, including updating the cost-of-casualty amount and developing internal guidance on the most appropriate tool to use for future launches. The GAO's report highlights the importance of addressing these weaknesses to ensure the validity of the MPL methodology and the results obtained for each launch. The FAA's MPL methodology is critical in balancing the encouragement of the U.S. commercial space industry with the need to manage the federal government's risk exposure. The GAO's recommendations aim to improve the FAA's MPL methodology and ensure that the federal government is not exposed to greater liability costs than intended. The FAA has not updated the cost-of-casualty amount since 1988,", "answers": ["The federal government shares liability risks with the commercial space launch industry for accidents that result in damages to third parties or federal property. This arrangement requires space launch companies to have a specific amount of insurance to cover these damages. The government is potentially liable for damages above that amount, up to a cap GAO estimated to be $3.1 billion in 2017, subject to appropriations in advance. CSLCA, enacted in 2015, directed the Department of Transportation, of which FAA is a part, to evaluate its MPL methodology and, if necessary, develop a plan to update that methodology. The act also included a provision requiring GAO to assess FAA's evaluation and any actions needed to update the methodology. This report discusses the extent to which (1) FAA's evaluation report addresses the requirements in CSLCA and (2) FAA has addressed previously identified weaknesses in the MPL methodology. GAO reviewed documents and interviewed FAA on its loss methodology evaluation and actions to address weaknesses. The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) report evaluating its maximum probable loss (MPL) methodology did not fully address the evaluation and consultation requirements specified by the U.S. Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act (CSLCA). Balance of Risk. CSLCA required FAA to include ensuring that the federal government is not exposed to greater indemnification costs and that launch companies are not required to purchase more insurance coverage than necessary as a result of FAA's MPL methodology. FAA said that it ensured this balance by improving its methodology, but it did not reevaluate its probability thresholds after revising its methodology. These thresholds are used to divide the risk of loss between launch companies and the government. Impact on Costs. The act required FAA to consider the costs to both the industry and the federal government of implementing an updated methodology. FAA's report discussed the impact on indirect costs, such as data collection, but did not discuss direct costs: insurance premiums for launch companies and indemnification liability for the federal government. Consultation. The act also required FAA to consult with the commercial space sector and insurance providers in evaluating its MPL methodology in accordance with the preceding requirements. While the agency consulted with some stakeholders, these consultations were limited in scope. FAA officials said they have not been able to take the actions needed to fully satisfy the mandated elements because of issues such as resource limitations and the lack of available data. However, by not resolving these issues, FAA lacks assurance that launch companies are not purchasing more insurance than needed or that the federal government is not being exposed to greater indemnification costs than expected. FAA has addressed two of three previously identified weaknesses in its MPL methodology but has not yet dealt with the remaining weakness. Specifically, the agency has revised its methodology for estimating the number of potential casualties for a launch and changed the factor it uses to derive estimated property damage from estimated casualties. However, FAA has not updated the amount used for the cost of an individual casualty. GAO recommended in a March 2017 report (GAO-17-366) that FAA update this amount. Not doing so could understate the amount of insurance launch companies are required to purchase, exposing the federal government to excess risk. GAO also determined that while FAA has two tools and methods it can use in making its MPL estimates, it does not have guidance on determining which are most appropriate for a given launch scenario. For example, one tool is more comprehensive but also labor intensive to use, while the other is inappropriate for certain launch scenarios and could result in misleading MPL amounts. Officials said they have begun to create such guidance but do not have an estimated completion date. Without such guidance, FAA cannot ensure that the most appropriate MPL methodology is used for each launch. FAA should fully address mandated requirements in evaluating its MPL—probability thresholds, direct costs, and stakeholder consultations— and establish an estimated completion date for developing guidance on tools and methods to use for specific launch scenarios. The Department of Transportation concurred with the recommendations, and provided technical comments."], "length": 26972}

{"pred": " Passage 3\nThe Runaway and Homeless Youth Act of 1974 was enacted to address the vulnerabilities of runaway youth, and since then, the law has been updated to provide support for runaway and homeless youth outside of the juvenile justice, mental health, and child welfare systems. The Act authorizes federal funding for three programs: the Basic Center Program (BCP), Transitional Living Program (TLP), and Street Outreach Program (SOP). The BCP provides short-term shelter and services for youth and their families, while the TLP provides longer-term shelter and assistance for youth ages 16-22. The SOP provides services for runaway and homeless youth living on the streets or in areas that increase their risk of using drugs or being subjected to sexual abuse. The programs have served over 31,000 youth in FY2016, with the BCP serving 23,288 youth and the TLP serving 3,517 youth. The Street Outreach Program has made contact with over 36,000 youth in FY2016. The Act also requires grantees to report data on the number and characteristics of the youth they serve, and the data strategy outlined in the framework involves coordinating the former data collection system with HUD's Homeless Management Information Systems (HMIS). The Runaway and Homeless Youth Program is administered by the Family and Youth Services Bureau (FYSB) within HHS's Administration for Children and Families (ACF). The program has received increased funding over the years, with the authorization of appropriations for the BCP and TLP being $127.4 million for each of FY2019 and FY2020. The program has also been evaluated through the Runaway and Homeless Youth Monitoring System, which evaluates the performance of grantees and identifies areas for improvement. The program has also been supported by other federal initiatives, including the Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program (YHDP) and the 100-Day Challenges to End Youth Homelessness. The program has also been recognized for its efforts to prevent and end youth homelessness, with the USICH issuing a brief outlining the continued gaps in data on the homeless youth population. Overall, the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act of 1974 has provided critical support for runaway and homeless youth, and the program continues to evolve to address the changing needs of this population. The program has served thousands of youth and has been recognized for its efforts to prevent and end youth homelessness. The program has also been supported by other federal initiatives, and the data strategy outlined in the framework involves", "answers": ["This report discusses runaway and homeless youth, and the federal response to support this population. There is no single definition of the terms \"runaway youth\" or \"homeless youth.\" However, both groups of youth share the risk of not having adequate shelter and other provisions, and may engage in harmful behaviors while away from a permanent home. Youth most often cite family conflict as the major reason for their homelessness or episodes of running away. A youth's sexual orientation, sexual activity, school problems, and substance abuse are associated with family discord. The precise number of homeless and runaway youth is unknown due to their residential mobility and overlap among the populations. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is supporting data collection efforts, known as Voices of Youth Count, to better determine the number of homeless youth. The 2017 study found that approximately 700,000 youth ages 13 to 17 and 3.5 million young adults ages 18 to 25 experienced homelessness within a 12-month period because they were sleeping in places not meant for habitation, in shelters, or with others while lacking alternative living arrangements. From the early 20th century through the 1960s, the needs of runaway and homeless youth were handled locally through the child welfare agency, juvenile justice courts, or both. The 1970s marked a shift toward federal oversight of programs that help youth who had run afoul of the law, including those who committed status offenses (i.e., a noncriminal act that is considered a violation of the law because of the youth's age). The Runaway Youth Act of 1974 was enacted as Title III of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (P.L. 93-415) to assist runaways through services specifically for this population. The act was amended over time to include homeless youth. It authorizes funding for services carried out under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Program (RHYP), which is administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The program was most recently authorized through FY2020 by the Juvenile Justice Reform Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-385). This law did not make other changes to the RHYP statute. Funding is discretionary, meaning provided through the appropriations process. FY2019 appropriations are $127.4 million. The RHYP program is made up of three components: the Basic Center Program (BCP), Transitional Living Program (TLP), and Street Outreach Program (SOP). The BCP provides temporary shelter, counseling, and after care services to runaway and homeless youth under age 18 and their families. In FY2017, the program served 23,288 youth, and in FY2018 it funded 280 BCP shelters (most recent figures available). The TLP is targeted to older youth ages 16 through 22 (and sometimes an older age). In FY2017, the TLP program served 3,517 youth, and in FY2018 it funded 299 grantees (most recent figures available). Youth who use the TLP receive longer-term housing with supportive services. The SOP provides education, treatment, counseling, and referrals for runaway, homeless, and street youth who have been subjected to, or are at risk of being subjected to, sexual abuse, sex exploitation, and trafficking. In FY2017, the SOP grantees made contact with 24,366 youth. The RHYP is a part of larger federal efforts to end youth homelessness through the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH). The USICH is a coordinating body made up of multiple federal agencies committed to addressing homelessness. The USICH's Opening Doors plan to end homelessness includes strategies for ending youth homelessness by 2020, including through collecting better data and supporting evidence-based practices to improve youth outcomes. Voices of Youth Count is continuing to report on characteristics of homeless youth. In addition to the RHYP, there are other federal supports to address youth homelessness. HUD's Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program is funding a range of housing options for youth, in selected urban and rural communities. Other federal programs have enabled homeless youth to access services, including those related to education and family violence."], "length": 26408}

The program is administered by the states, with the federal government providing funding and oversight. The program has several requirements, including work requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWDs). ABAWDs must work or participate in a work program for 20 hours or more per week, or participate in workfare, in which they perform work to earn the value of their SNAP benefits. The program also has a time limit for ABAWDs, limiting them to 3 months of SNAP benefits in a 36-month period. States have flexibility in designing their SNAP Employment and Training (E&T) programs, which provide services to help participants find and keep jobs. The programs can be voluntary or mandatory, and states can choose which services to offer. The federal government provides funding for the programs, and states are responsible for implementing and overseeing them. The program has faced challenges, including improper payments and fraud. The federal government has taken steps to address these issues, including increasing oversight and providing technical assistance to states. The program has also seen a decline in participation in SNAP E&T programs, which may be due to changes in state policies and funding. Overall, the program aims to help low-income individuals and families access food assistance and achieve self-sufficiency.\n\nSummary: Passage 3\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has a policy requiring reviews of providers' clinical care after concerns are raised about their care.

The VA medical centers also failed to report nine providers to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) and state licensing boards as required by VHA policy. The GAO concluded that VHA lacks reasonable assurance that all providers who should be reported are reported, and that this failure facilitates providers who provide substandard care at one facility obtaining privileges at another VA medical center or at hospitals outside of VA's healthcare system. The GAO recommended that VHA require documentation of all reviews of providers' clinical care, establish a timeliness requirement for initiating such reviews, and strengthen its oversight by requiring networks to oversee VA medical centers to ensure that such reviews are documented and initiated in a timely manner. VA concurred with these recommendations and plans to revise existing policy and update the standardized audit tool used by the networks to include more comprehensive oversight of VA medical centers' reviews of providers' clinical care.  The GAO also found that VA medical center officials were generally not familiar with or misinterpreted VHA policies related to NPDB and state licensing board reporting, and that VHA policy does not require the networks to oversee whether VA medical centers are reporting providers to the NPDB or state licensing boards when warranted.

The rule was first introduced in 1835 and has undergone several changes since then. The current version of the rule, adopted in the 115th Congress, allows for retrenchments that reduce expenditures by a reduction of amounts of money in the bill, the reduction of the number and salary of officers of the United States, or the reduction of the compensation of any person paid out of the Treasury of the United States. The rule does not apply to funds other than those appropriated in the pending general appropriations bill, and the application of the broader exceptions in the separate order are still subject to the general requirement for germaneness. The Holman rule is not intended to open the door for legislative provisions that would expand the scope of the bill.

The program was authorized by the CHIP-IN Act, which was enacted in 2017. The VA has been working with an Omaha donor group to construct an ambulatory care center in Omaha, Nebraska, using a donation of $30 million from the donor group and $56 million in federal funds. The program has several requirements, including that the property must have already received appropriations for a VA facility project or be identified as a need as part of the VA's long-range capital planning process. The VA has also established a steering committee to oversee the pilot program and has begun to implement leading practices for pilot design, including stakeholder communication and the development of an assessment methodology and evaluation plan.

Since the period immediately after its initial adoption, the House has interpreted the Holman rule through precedents that have tended to incrementally narrow its application. Under current precedents, for a legislative provision or amendment to be in order, the legislative language in question must be both germane to other provisions in the measure and must produce a clear reduction of appropriations in that bill. In addition, the House adopted a separate order during the 115th Congress that provided for retrenchments of expenditures by a reduction of amounts of money covered by the bill to be construed as applying to: any provision or amendment that retrenches expenditures by— (1) the reduction of amounts of money in the bill; (2) the reduction of the number and salary of the officers of the United States; or (3) the reduction of the compensation of any person paid out of the Treasury of the United States.

These capabilities make attack submarines some of the most–requested assets by the global combatant commanders. GAO was asked to review the readiness of the Navy's attack submarine force. This report discusses the extent to which the Navy (1) has experienced maintenance delays in its attack submarine fleet and costs associated with any delays; and (2) has addressed any challenges and developed mitigation plans for any maintenance delays. GAO analyzed readiness information from fiscal years 2008-2018, operating and support costs, maintenance performance, and other data; visited attack submarines and squadrons; and interviewed public and private shipyard and fleet officials. This is a public version of a classified report issued in October 2018. Information the Department of Defense deemed classified or sensitive, such as attack submarine force structure requirements and detailed data on attack submarine maintenance delays, has been omitted. The Navy has been unable to begin or complete the vast majority of its attack submarine maintenance periods on time resulting in significant maintenance delays and operating and support cost expenditures. GAO's analysis of Navy maintenance data shows that between fiscal year 2008 and 2018, attack submarines have incurred 10,363 days of idle time and maintenance delays as a result of delays in getting into and out of the shipyards. For example, the Navy originally scheduled the USS Boise to enter a shipyard for an extended maintenance period in 2013 but, due to heavy shipyard workload, the Navy delayed the start of the maintenance period. In June 2016, the USS Boise could no longer conduct normal operations and the boat has remained idle, pierside for over two years since then waiting to enter a shipyard (see figure). GAO estimated that since fiscal year 2008 the Navy has spent more than $1.5 billion in fiscal year 2018 constant dollars to support attack submarines that provide no operational capability—those sitting idle while waiting to enter the shipyards, and those delayed in completing their maintenance at the shipyards. The Navy has started to address challenges related to workforce shortages and facilities needs at the public shipyards. However, it has not effectively allocated maintenance periods among public shipyards and private shipyards that may also be available to help minimize attack submarine idle time. GAO's analysis found that while the public shipyards have operated above capacity for the past several years, attack submarine maintenance delays are getting longer and idle time is increasing. The Navy may have options to mitigate this idle time and maintenance delays by leveraging private shipyard capacity for repair work. But the Navy has not completed a comprehensive business case analysis as recommended by Department of Defense guidelines to inform maintenance workload allocation across public and private shipyards. Navy leadership has acknowledged that they need to be more proactive in leveraging potential private shipyard repair capacity. Without addressing this challenge, the Navy risks continued expenditure of operating and support funding to crew, maintain, and support attack submarines that provide no operational capability because they are delayed in getting into and out of maintenance. GAO recommends that the Navy conduct a business case analysis to inform maintenance workload allocation across public and private shipyards.

{"pred": " Passage 2\nThe Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is a government agency that insures private mortgage lenders against the possibility of borrowers defaulting on certain mortgage loans. FHA-insured mortgages have lower down payment requirements and less stringent credit history requirements than conventional mortgages, making them attractive to first-time homebuyers, low- and moderate-income households, and minorities. The FHA-insured mortgage program plays a countercyclical role in the mortgage market, insuring more mortgages when the mortgage market is tight and fewer mortgages when the market is strong. The program is funded through insurance premiums and proceeds from the sale of foreclosed homes, and it has a Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMI Fund) that is required to maintain a capital ratio of at least 2%. The MMI Fund has historically generated negative credit subsidy, meaning it has not required appropriations to cover the expected costs of loans to be insured. However, the fund's capital ratio has been below the 2% threshold in the past, raising concerns that FHA may need assistance to continue to hold enough funds to cover expected future losses. To strengthen the insurance fund, FHA has taken steps such as increasing mortgage insurance premiums, strengthening underwriting requirements, and increasing oversight of FHA-approved lenders. The number of new mortgages insured by FHA has fluctuated over the years, peaking at 1.8 million in FY2009 and decreasing to 1.25 million in FY2017. As of FY2018, FHA insured over 1 million new single-family purchase and refinance mortgages, with an initial loan balance of $209 billion. The overall number of mortgages insured by FHA in FY2018 represented a decrease from FY2017, but FHA's market share remains higher than it was in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The FHA-insured mortgage program has been a subject of ongoing debate among policymakers, with some arguing that it has played a crucial role in providing affordable housing options for certain borrowers, while others have raised concerns about the program's financial sustainability and the potential risks associated with its countercyclical role in the mortgage market. The program's market share has fluctuated over the years, peaking at over 30% of home-purchase mortgages in 2009 and 2010, and decreasing to 19.5% in 2017. The FHA-insured mortgage program has been a key player in the U.S. housing finance system, providing a vital source of financing for many homebuyers. However, the program's financial sustainability", "answers": ["The Federal Housing Administration (FHA), an agency of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), was created by the National Housing Act of 1934. FHA insures private lenders against the possibility of borrowers defaulting on mortgages that meet certain criteria, thereby expanding the availability of mortgage credit beyond what may be available otherwise. If the borrower defaults on the mortgage, FHA is to repay the lender the remaining amount owed. A household that obtains an FHA-insured mortgage must meet FHA's eligibility and underwriting standards, including showing that it has sufficient income to repay a mortgage. FHA requires a minimum down payment of 3.5% from most borrowers, which is lower than the down payment required for many other types of mortgages. FHA-insured mortgages cannot exceed a statutory maximum mortgage amount, which varies by area and is based on area median house prices but cannot exceed a specified ceiling in high-cost areas. (The ceiling is set at $726,525 in high-cost areas in calendar year 2019.) Borrowers are charged fees, called mortgage insurance premiums, in exchange for the insurance. In FY2018, FHA insured over 1 million new mortgages (including both home purchase and refinance mortgages) with a combined principal balance of $209 billion. FHA's share of the mortgage market tends to vary with economic conditions and other factors. In the aftermath of the housing market turmoil that began around 2007 and a related contraction of mortgage lending, FHA insured a larger share of mortgages than it had in the preceding years. Its overall share of the mortgage market increased from about 3% in calendar year 2005 to a peak of 21% in 2009. Since that time, FHA's share of the mortgage market has decreased somewhat, though it remains higher than it was in the early 2000s. In calendar year 2017, FHA's overall share of the mortgage market was about 17%. FHA-insured mortgages, like all mortgages, experienced increased default rates during the housing downturn that began around 2007, leading to concerns about the stability of the FHA insurance fund for single-family mortgages, the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMI Fund). In response to these concerns, FHA adopted a number of policy changes in an attempt to limit risk to the MMI Fund. These changes have included raising the fees that it charges and making changes to certain eligibility criteria for FHA-insured loans."], "length": 26302}

The country has also been improving its energy security in recent years, with the rehabilitation of hydropower plants and the construction of new ones. Georgia aspires to be a key transit hub for the growing East-West overland trade route between China and Europe. The country has close relations with NATO and the EU, with the EU being a major provider of foreign aid to Georgia. However, Georgia's relations with Russia have been difficult, with Russia supporting Abkhazia and South Ossetia to prevent Georgia from joining NATO.

U.S. policy expressly supports Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders, and Georgia is a leading recipient of U.S. aid to Europe and Eurasia. Many observers consider Georgia to be one of the most democratic states in the post-Soviet region, even as the country faces ongoing governance challenges. The center-left Georgian Dream-Democratic Georgia party (GD) has close to a three-fourths supermajority in parliament and governs with limited checks and balances. Although Georgia faces high rates of poverty and underemployment, its economy in 2017 and 2018 appeared to show stronger growth than it had in the previous four years. The GD led a coalition to victory in parliamentary elections in 2012 amid growing dissatisfaction with the former ruling party, Mikheil Saakashvili's center-right United National Movement, which came to power as a result of Georgia's 2003 Rose Revolution. In August 2008, Russia went to war with Georgia to prevent Saakashvili's government from reestablishing control over the regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which broke away from Georgia in the early 1990s and became informal Russian protectorates. Congress has expressed firm support for Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Countering Russian Influence in Europe and Eurasia Act of 2017 (P.L. 115-44, Title II, §253) states that the United States \"does not recognize territorial changes effected by force, including the illegal invasions and occupations\" of Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and other territories occupied by Russia.

Since 1776, this award, which initially was bestowed on military leaders, has also been given to such diverse individuals as Sir Winston Churchill and Bob Hope, George Washington and Robert Frost, Joe Louis and Mother Teresa of Calcutta. Congressional gold medal legislation generally has a specific format. Once a gold medal is authorized, it follows a specific process for design, minting, and awarding. This process includes consultation and recommendations by the Citizens Coinage Advisory Commission (CCAC) and the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts (CFA), pursuant to any statutory instructions, before the Secretary of the Treasury makes the final decision on a gold medal's design. Once the medal has been struck, a ceremony will often be scheduled to formally award the medal to the recipient. In recent years, the number of gold medals awarded has increased, and some have expressed interest in examining the gold medal awarding process. Should Congress want to make such changes, several individual and institutional options might be available. The individual options include decisions made by Members of Congress as to what individual or groups might be honored; potential specification of gold medal design elements; and where gold medals for groups might be housed once the award is made.

The State Vocational Rehabilitation Services program is the primary federal effort to help individuals with disabilities prepare for and obtain employment. State VR agencies must provide a 21.3% nonfederal match of funds and reserve at least 15% of their VR allotment for pre-employment transition services for students with disabilities. Most state VR agencies reported expanding services for students with disabilities since WIOA's enactment, providing the five required activities to more students, and developing additional programming. However, some agencies for the blind reported not providing the five required activities to more students, and officials in these agencies said they can serve a much smaller population. State VR agencies reported taking a range of actions to build their administrative capacity to implement pre-employment transition services, including building staff capacity and expanding contracts with service providers. Despite these efforts, most state VR agencies reported not using all the funds reserved for pre-employment transition services, and some reported challenges in identifying eligible students and providing authorized activities. The Department of Education (Education) has provided guidance and technical assistance to state VR agencies, but some state VR agencies reported that they would like more detailed information directly from Education on allowable expenditures. Education officials said they plan to clarify guidance as they learn about the issues from states during their monitoring.

Of the 74 state vocational rehabilitation (VR) agencies that responded to GAO's survey, most reported expanding services to help students with disabilities transition from school to work as required under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), enacted in July 2014. Most state agencies reported serving more students and providing work-based learning experiences and other activities, referred to as pre-employment transition services (see figure). State VR agencies reported two key challenges with implementing pre-employment transition services for students as required by WIOA. Spending reserved funds : States reported spending about $357 million out of the $465 million reserved for these services in fiscal year 2016. Education officials said that states had difficulty determining what expenditures were allowable, and some state officials said they would like more detailed information from Education. Education officials said they plan to clarify guidance but have no timeframe for providing further information, which would help states to better plan their use of reserved funds. Finalizing interagency agreements : Fewer than half the state VR agencies that responded to GAO's survey (34 of 74) reported updating their interagency agreement with their state's educational agency. Interagency agreements can help promote collaboration by, for example, establishing roles and responsibilities of each agency. Although Education offers technical assistance on interagency agreements, without increased efforts to raise awareness about the importance of these agreements and provide assistance to states where needed, Education may miss opportunities to help state VR and educational agencies efficiently and effectively coordinate services. In addition, WIOA requires Education to highlight best state practices, and most VR agencies responding to GAO's survey (63 of 74) reported this would be useful. Education does not have a written plan or timeframe for identifying and disseminating best practices. As a result, Education may miss opportunities to help more students with disabilities successfully transition from school to work.

According to the Department of State, this assistance to the Palestinians promotes U.S. economic and political foreign policy interests by supporting Middle East peace negotiations and financing economic stabilization programs. USAID is primarily responsible for administering ESF assistance to the West Bank and Gaza. Appropriations acts for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 included provisions for GAO to review the treatment, handling, and uses of funds provided through the ESF for assistance to the West Bank and Gaza. This report examines (1) the status of ESF assistance and projects provided to the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016, including project assistance and payments to PA creditors, and (2) the extent to which USAID conducted required vetting of PA creditors to ensure that this assistance would not support entities or individuals associated with terrorism and assessed PA ministries' capacity to use ESF assistance as intended. GAO reviewed relevant laws and regulations and USAID financial data, policies, procedures, and documents. GAO also interviewed USAID and State Department officials. As of March 2018, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) had allocated about $545 million of funding appropriated to the Economic Support Fund (ESF) for assistance in the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016. USAID obligated about $544 million (over 99 percent) and expended about $351 million (over 64 percent) of the total allocations. Project assistance accounted for approximately $399 million of the obligated funds, while payments to Palestinian Authority (PA) creditors accounted for $145 million (see figure). USAID's obligations for project assistance in the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 supported three development objectives—Economic Growth and Infrastructure ($239 million), Investing in the Next Generation ($107 million), and Governance and Civic Engagement (about $25 million). In fiscal years 2015 and 2016, USAID made payments directly to PA creditors—two Israeli fuel companies, to cover debts for petroleum purchases, and a local Palestinian bank, to pay off a line of credit used for PA medical referrals to six hospitals in the East Jerusalem Hospital network. USAID vetted PA creditors to ensure that the program assistance would not provide support to entities or individuals associated with terrorism and also conducted external assessments and financial audits of PA ministries of Health and Finance and Planning. USAID documentation showed that, as required, officials checked the vetting status of each PA creditor within 12 months before USAID signed its debt relief grant agreements with the PA. In addition, although USAID determined that it was not legally required to assess the PA Ministry of Health's medical referral services and the Ministry of Finance and Planning's petroleum procurement system, the agency commissioned external assessments of both ministries. These assessments found some weaknesses in both ministries' systems; however, USAID mission officials stated that these weaknesses did not affect USAID debt relief payments to the PA creditors. Nevertheless, USAID took additional steps to mitigate the identified weaknesses. For example, a USAID contractor worked with the Ministry of Health to update, revise, and approve guidelines for medical referrals. In addition, USAID commissioned financial audits of the debt relief grant agreements between USAID and the PA for direct payments to PA creditors in fiscal year 2015 and 2016. The audits did not identify any ineligible costs, reportable material weaknesses in internal control, or material instances of noncompliance with the terms of the agreements.

The method involves obtaining a 3D image dataset of an examination region including the vascular segment, generating a 3D vascular model from the dataset, capturing a contrast agent propagation in the examination region, inputting blood flow parameters, and starting a CFD simulation of the blood flow in the 3D vascular model. The method also involves generating virtual 2D angiography recordings from the results of the CFD simulation, determining a degree of correspondence between the real and virtual 2D angiography recordings, and comparing the degree of correspondence with predefinable tolerance values. The method enables the CFD simulation results to be validated for the individual patient, or any deviations to be quantitatively determined and used iteratively to improve the CFD simulation.\n\nSummary: Passage 2\nThe passage discusses the changes to payment rates for laboratory tests under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (CLFS) after the implementation of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act (PAMA) in 2018. Prior to 2018, payment rates for individual laboratory tests were based on rates charged in 1984-1985 adjusted for inflation, and 57 geographic jurisdictions had their own fee schedules. After PAMA's implementation, a single national fee schedule was established, and payment rates were based on private-payer rates for laboratory tests paid from January 1, 2016, through June 30, 2016.

The FCC uses the Form 477 to collect data on broadband availability, but the data is not accurate or complete, particularly for tribal lands. The FCC's method of collecting data leads to overstatements of broadband access on tribal lands because it captures nationwide broadband availability data, but does not account for factors such as affordability, service quality, and denials of service. The FCC has acknowledged the limitations of its data collection method and has proposed changes to modernize the Form 477 data collection. However, the FCC has not yet implemented these changes, and the issue of inaccurate data on tribal lands remains a concern. The FCC's data collection method has been criticized by tribal stakeholders, who argue that the data does not accurately reflect the reality of broadband access on their lands. The FCC has also been criticized for not having a formal process to obtain input from tribes on the accuracy of provider-submitted broadband data. The FCC has acknowledged the need to improve its data collection method and has proposed changes to address the issue, but more needs to be done to ensure that the data accurately reflects the reality of broadband access on tribal lands. The GAO recommends that the FCC develop and implement methods to collect and report accurate and complete data on broadband access specific to tribal lands, develop a formal process to obtain tribal input on the accuracy of provider-submitted broadband data, and obtain feedback from tribal stakeholders and providers on the effectiveness of FCC's tribal engagement guidance.

Congress has prioritized identifying and targeting funds to unserved areas. FCC uses data from broadband providers to develop maps and reports depicting broadband availability in the United States, with specific information on tribal lands. GAO was asked to review FCC's efforts to collect broadband data for tribal lands. This report examines the extent to which: (1) FCC's approach to collecting broadband data accurately captures broadband access on tribal lands and (2) FCC obtains tribal input on the data. GAO interviewed stakeholders from 25 tribal governments or tribally owned providers, and visited nine tribal lands. The selected tribes varied geographically and in levels of broadband availability, among other characteristics. GAO also reviewed FCC's rulemakings on broadband data and interviewed other tribal stakeholders, FCC officials, and 13 non-tribal broadband providers selected to include a diversity of technologies. Provider and tribal interviews were based on non-generalizable samples. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) collects data on broadband availability from providers, but these data do not accurately or completely capture broadband access on tribal lands. Specifically, FCC collects data on broadband availability; these data capture where providers may have broadband infrastructure. However, FCC considers broadband to be “available” for an entire census block if the provider could serve at least one location in the census block. This leads to overstatements of service for specific locations like tribal lands (see figure). FCC, tribal stakeholders, and providers have noted that this approach leads to overstatements of broadband availability. Because FCC uses these data to measure broadband access, it also overstates broadband access—the ability to obtain service—on tribal lands. Additionally, FCC does not collect information on several factors—such as affordability, quality, and denials of service—that FCC and tribal stakeholders stated can affect the extent to which Americans living on tribal lands can access broadband services. FCC provides broadband funding for unserved areas based on its broadband data. Overstatements of access limit FCC's and tribal stakeholders' abilities to target broadband funding to such areas. For example, some tribal officials stated that inaccurate data have affected their ability to plan their own broadband networks and obtain funding to address broadband gaps on their lands. By developing and implementing methods for collecting and reporting accurate and complete data on broadband access specific to tribal lands, FCC would be better able to target federal broadband funding to tribal areas that need it the most and to more accurately assess FCC's progress toward its goal of increasing all Americans' access to affordable broadband. FCC does not have a formal process to obtain tribal input on the accuracy of provider-submitted broadband data. In the National Broadband Plan , FCC highlighted the need for a targeted approach to improve broadband availability data for tribal lands. As outlined in the plan, such an approach would include working with tribes to ensure that information is accurate and useful. About half of the tribal stakeholders GAO interviewed raised concerns that FCC relies solely on data from providers, and most stated FCC should work with tribes to improve the accuracy of FCC's data. Establishing a formal process to obtain input from tribal governments on the accuracy of provider-submitted broadband data could help improve the accuracy of FCC's broadband data for tribal lands.

Within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) has a plan to establish 18 new national cemeteries to increase reasonable access to burial options for veterans. NCA defines reasonable access as a national or state veterans' cemetery being located within 75 miles of veterans' homes. Key parts of NCA's plan include establishing 13 urban and rural initiative national cemeteries and awarding grant funds to state applicants for establishing new state veterans' cemeteries. NCA has made limited progress in implementing its plan to increase burial access and is years behind its original schedule for opening new cemeteries. For example, NCA has opened only two of its planned urban and rural initiative sites and is behind its original schedule for the other 11 (see fig. below). The primary factor delaying NCA's completion of these cemeteries has been challenges in acquiring suitable land. NCA has also been challenged in producing accurate estimates of construction costs for most of its rural initiative sites. Cost estimates have increased more than 200 percent (from about $7 million to $24 million) for these sites, and NCA's guidance for developing cost estimates for the cemeteries does not fully incorporate the 12 steps identified in cost-estimating leading practices—such as conducting a risk and uncertainty analysis or a sensitivity analysis. As a result, NCA is not well positioned to provide reliable and valid cost estimates to better inform decisions to enhance veterans' cemetery access.

The report also notes that the House has a number of procedures for limiting debate and preventing minorities from filibustering. The report discusses the use of special rules to expedite the consideration of bills, and notes that these rules can be used to limit the number and form of amendments that can be offered. The report also discusses the use of conference committees to resolve differences between the House and Senate.

On a day-to-day basis, however, the House can also decide to grant individual bills privileged access to the floor, using one of several parliamentary mechanisms. The standing rules of the House include several different parliamentary mechanisms that the body may use to act on bills and resolutions. Which of these will be employed in a given instance usually depends on the extent to which Members want to debate and amend the legislation. In general, all of the procedures of the House permit a majority of Members to work their will without excessive delay. The House considers most legislation by motions to suspend the rules, with limited debate and no floor amendments, with the support of at least two-thirds of the Members voting. Occasionally, the House will choose to consider a measure on the floor by the unanimous consent of Members. The Rules Committee is instrumental in recommending procedures for considering major bills and may propose restrictions on the floor amendments that Members can offer or bar them altogether. Many major bills are first considered in Committee of the Whole before being passed by a simple majority vote of the House. The Committee of the Whole is governed by more flexible procedures than the basic rules of the House, under which a majority can vote to pass a bill after only one hour of debate and with no floor amendments. Although a quorum is supposed to be present on the floor when the House is conducting business, the House assumes a quorum is present unless a quorum call or electronically recorded vote demonstrates that it is not. However, the standing rules preclude quorum calls at most times other than when the House is voting. Questions are first decided by voice vote, although any Member may then demand a division vote. Before the final result of a voice or division vote is announced, Members can secure an electronically recorded vote instead if enough Members desire it or if a quorum is not present in the House. The constitutional requirements for making law mean that each chamber must pass the same measure with the identical text before transmitting it to the President for his consideration. When the second chamber of Congress amends a measure sent to it by the first chamber, the two chambers must resolve legislative differences to meet this requirement. This can be accomplished by shuttling the bill back and forth between the House and Senate, with each chamber proposing amendments to the position of the other, or by establishing a conference committee to try to negotiate a compromise version of the legislation."], "length": 26918}

The investigation found that the medical centers lacked adequate documentation of reviews of providers' clinical care, and in some cases, the required reviews were not conducted at all. The GAO identified two factors contributing to these shortcomings: VHA policy does not require documentation of all types of reviews, and VHA's oversight of these reviews is inadequate. The investigation also found that providers were not reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) and state licensing boards as required, which facilitated providers who provide substandard care at one facility obtaining privileges at another VA medical center or at hospitals outside of VA's healthcare system. The GAO recommended that VHA require documentation of all reviews of providers' clinical care, establish a timeliness requirement for initiating such reviews, and strengthen its oversight by requiring networks to oversee VA medical centers to ensure that such reviews are documented and initiated in a timely manner. VA concurred with these recommendations and described plans for revising existing policy and updating the standardized audit tool used by the networks.

The review found that the medical centers lacked documentation for almost half of the reviews conducted, and in some cases, the required reviews were not conducted at all. The review also found that the VA medical centers did not always conduct reviews in a timely manner, with some reviews taking multiple years to initiate. The main factors contributing to these issues were inadequate VHA policy and oversight. The review recommended that VHA require documentation of all reviews, establish a timeliness requirement, and strengthen its oversight. VA concurred with these recommendations and plans to revise existing policy and update the audit tool. The review also found that VA medical centers failed to report providers to the NPDB and state licensing boards as required, which facilitated providers who provided substandard care at one facility obtaining privileges at another VA medical center or outside of VA's healthcare system. The review recommended that VHA require its networks to establish a process for overseeing VA medical centers to ensure timely reporting to the NPDB and state licensing boards. VA concurred with this recommendation and plans to include oversight of timely reporting in the standard audit tool. The review highlighted the importance of adequate oversight and documentation to ensure that providers who provide substandard care are held accountable. The key evidence presented includes the lack of documentation for almost half of the reviews conducted, the untimely initiation of reviews, and the failure to report providers to the NPDB and state licensing boards. The unique point made in the passage is the importance of adequate oversight and documentation to ensure that providers who provide substandard care are held accountable. The innovative point made is the recommendation to require networks to establish a process for overseeing VA medical centers to ensure timely reporting to the NPDB and state licensing boards.

{"pred": " Passage 2\nThe Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) requires states to have policies and procedures in place to address the needs of infants affected by prenatal substance abuse or withdrawal symptoms at birth. States have experienced challenges implementing new CAPTA requirements, citing a lack of specificity in guidance from the Administration for Children and Families (ACF). Many states reported that they are not completely adhering to the law, and some have been placed on Program Improvement Plans. States have requested additional guidance and assistance from ACF, including trainings and teleconferences with other states, to help overcome their challenges. ACF has provided some guidance and technical assistance to states, but states have expressed confusion about certain terms, including \"affected\" and \"legal vs. illegal\" substances. The opioid epidemic has generated a significant increase in the number of substance-affected infants born and diagnosed with NAS, and states have reported challenges in providing adequate supports and services to these vulnerable infants. The GAO recommends that the Secretary of HHS direct ACF to provide additional guidance and technical assistance to states to address known challenges and enhance their understanding of CAPTA requirements. HHS has responded that it will continue to provide technical assistance to states, but the GAO believes that additional guidance is also needed to help states better implement protections for children. The GAO's findings demonstrate that additional guidance is necessary to help states address the needs of substance-affected infants and their families. The report highlights the importance of providing adequate supports and services to these vulnerable infants and the need for states to have clear guidance on implementing CAPTA requirements. The GAO's recommendation is intended to help states better implement protections for children and ensure that they have the necessary resources and support to address the needs of substance-affected infants and their families. The report emphasizes the need for states to have clear guidance on implementing CAPTA requirements and the importance of providing adequate supports and services to substance-affected infants and their families.

The report emphasizes the importance of providing clear guidance to states on implementing CAPTA requirements and the need for states to have the necessary resources and support to address the needs", "answers": ["Under CAPTA, states perform a range of prevention activities, including addressing the needs of infants born with prenatal drug exposure. The number of children under the age of 1 entering foster care increased by about 15 percent from fiscal years 2012 through 2015. Child welfare professionals attribute the increase to the opioid epidemic. GAO was asked to examine the steps states are taking to implement CAPTA requirements on substance-affected infants and related amendments enacted in 2016. This report examines (1) the extent to which states have adopted policies and procedures to notify CPS of substance-affected infants; (2) state efforts to develop plans of safe care, and associated challenges; and (3) steps HHS has taken to help states implement the provisions. To obtain this information, GAO surveyed state CPS directors in all 50 states and the District of Columbia and reached a 100 percent response rate. GAO also visited 3 states (Kentucky, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania); reviewed relevant documents such as federal laws and regulations, and HHS guidance; and interviewed HHS officials. GAO did not assess states' compliance with CAPTA requirements. All states reported adopting, to varying degrees, policies and procedures regarding health care providers notifying child protective services (CPS) about infants affected by opioids or other substances. Under the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA), as amended, governors are required to provide assurances that the states have laws or programs that include policies and procedures to address the needs of infants affected by prenatal substance use. This is to include health care providers notifying CPS of substance-affected infants. In response to GAO's survey, 42 states reported having policies and procedures that require health care providers to notify CPS about substance-affected infants and 8 states reported having policies that encourage notification. The remaining 1 state has a policy requiring health care providers to assess the needs of mothers and infants and if they conclude that infants are at risk for abuse or neglect, CPS is notified. In response to GAO's survey, 49 states reported that their CPS agency has policies to develop a plan of safe care; 2 reported not having such a requirement. Under CAPTA, states are required to develop a plan of safe care for substance-affected infants. Although not defined in law, a plan of safe care generally entails an assessment of the family's situation and a plan for connecting families to appropriate services to stabilize the family and ensure the child's safety and well-being. States reported that plans typically address the infant's safety needs, immediate medical needs, and the caregiver's substance use treatment needs. However, officials in the 3 states GAO visited noted challenges, including uncertainty about what to include in plans and the level of intervention needed for infants at low risk of abuse or neglect. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has provided technical assistance and guidance to states to implement these CAPTA requirements. Most states reported in GAO's survey that additional guidance and assistance would be very or extremely helpful for addressing their challenges. Nevertheless, HHS officials told GAO that the agency does not anticipate issuing additional written guidance, but that states can access technical assistance through their regional offices and the National Center on Substance Abuse and Child Welfare—a resource center funded by HHS. However, of the 37 states that reported on the helpfulness of the assistance they have received, 19 said it was only moderately helpful to not helpful. States offered suggestions for improving the assistance, such as developing substance abuse training materials for staff and holding video conferences with other states to share information. In October 2017, HHS officials explained that some states have submitted plans that include details on how they are addressing the CAPTA requirements. HHS officials reported that some of the plans submitted to date indicated that states are not meeting the requirements and those states have been asked to develop program improvement plans. Without more specific guidance and assistance to enhance states' understanding of CAPTA requirements and better address known challenges such as the ones described in this report, states may miss an opportunity to provide more effective protections and services for the children and families most in need. GAO recommends that HHS provide additional guidance and technical assistance to states to address known challenges and enhance their understanding of requirements. HHS did not concur with the recommendation. As discussed in the report, GAO continues to believe that added guidance would benefit states."], "length": 26845}

Israel relies on its military and homeland security capabilities, as well as close cooperation with the United States, to manage potential threats to its security and existence. The country maintains conventional military superiority relative to its neighbors and the Palestinians, and has updated its efforts to project military strength, deter attack, and defend its population and borders. Israel has also reduced some unconventional threats via missile defense systems, reported cyber defense and warfare capabilities, and other heightened security measures. The country's leaders and supporters argue that Israel's security and the broader stability of the region remain critically important for U.S. interests, and that Israel is a valuable U.S. ally. However, the relationship is also marked by tensions, particularly with regard to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which has been exacerbated by recent U.S. actions, including the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital and the move of the U.S. embassy there. The conflict has led to a breakdown in U.S.-Palestinian relations, with the Palestinian Authority rejecting U.S. aid and the U.S. decision to cut off funding for the Palestinians. The U.S. has also expressed interest in brokering a final-status Israeli-Palestinian agreement, but the Administration has repeatedly postponed releasing a proposal. The situation is further complicated by the growing influence of Iran in the region, which has led to increased tensions between Israel and Iran, as well as between Israel and Hezbollah. The U.S. recognition of Israel's claims to sovereignty in the Golan Heights has also been met with opposition from the international community, and has raised concerns about the potential for wider conflict in the region.

Israeli domestic political issues, including elections scheduled for 2019. Israel relies on a number of strengths to manage potential threats to its security and existence. It maintains conventional military superiority relative to neighboring states and the Palestinians. It also takes measures to deter attack and defend its population and borders from evolving asymmetric threats such as rockets and missiles, cross-border tunneling, drones, and cyberattacks. Additionally, Israel has an undeclared but presumed nuclear weapons capability. Against a backdrop of strong bilateral cooperation, Israel's leaders and supporters routinely make the case that Israel's security and the broader stability of the region remain critically important for U.S. interests. A 10-year bilateral military aid memorandum of understanding (MOU)—signed in 2016—commits the United States to provide Israel $3.3 billion in Foreign Military Financing annually from FY2019 to FY2028, along with additional amounts from Defense Department accounts for missile defense. All of these amounts remain subject to congressional appropriations. Israeli officials seek to counter Iranian regional influence and prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu released new Israeli intelligence on Iran's nuclear program in April 2018, days before President Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 international agreement that constrains Iran's nuclear activities. It is unclear whether Israel might take future military action in Iran if Iranian nuclear activities resume. Since 2018, Israel has conducted a number of military operations in Syria against Iran and its allies, including Lebanese Hezbollah. Israel and Iran also appear to be competing for military advantage over each other at the Israel-Lebanon border. Amid uncertainty in the area, in March 2019 President Trump recognized Israel's claim to sovereignty over the Golan Heights, changing long-standing U.S. policy that held—in line with U.N. Security Council Resolution 497 from 1981—the Golan was occupied Syrian territory whose final status was subject to Israel-Syria negotiation. The prospects for an Israeli-Palestinian peace process are complicated by many factors. Palestinian leaders cut off high-level political contacts with the Trump Administration after it recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital in December 2017. U.S.-Palestinian tensions have since worsened amid U.S. cutoffs of funding to the Palestinians and diplomatic moves—including the May 2018 opening of the U.S. embassy to Israel in Jerusalem. Palestinian leaders interpreted these actions as prejudicing their claims to a capital in Jerusalem and to a just resolution of Palestinian refugee claims. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has welcomed these U.S. actions. The Trump Administration has suggested that it will release a proposed peace plan after Israeli elections, which are scheduled for April 9, 2019. Speculation continues about how warming ties between Israel and Arab Gulf states may affect Israeli-Palestinian diplomacy, though Saudi Arabia said that the U.S. policy change on the Golan Heights would negatively affect the peace process. Bouts of tension and violence between Israel and Hamas in Gaza have continued—reportedly accompanied by indirect talks between the two parties that are being brokered by Egypt and aim for a long-term cease-fire. Domestically, Israel is preparing for the April 9 elections, which are closely contested. Former top general Benny Gantz is combining with former Finance Minister Yair Lapid to challenge Netanyahu, whom the attorney general has recommended be indicted for corruption in three separate cases.

{"pred": " Passage 1\nThe patent describes a method for preparing dough or dough-based edible products with a high sucrose content using a sucrose-tolerant anti-staling amylase. The inventors have found that a high sucrose content dough tends to inhibit the activity of anti-staling amylases, making them less effective in preventing staling. They have identified sucrose-tolerant variants of a maltogenic alpha-amylase, which can be used to achieve a good anti-staling effect in cakes. The variants are designed by analyzing the 3D structure of the enzyme and identifying amino acid residues that are involved in sucrose binding. The inventors have also identified specific amino acid substitutions that can be made to increase the sucrose tolerance of the enzyme. The patent describes the properties of the sucrose-tolerant amylases, including their ability to hydrolyze amylose and their sugar tolerance. The inventors have tested several variants of the enzyme and found that they have improved anti-staling properties compared to the original enzyme. The patent also describes the use of the sucrose-tolerant amylases in preparing dough-based edible products, such as cakes, and the benefits of using these enzymes in terms of improved texture and moisture content. The inventors have tested the variants in various baking procedures and found that they can improve the texture and moisture content of cakes, making them more fresh and soft for a longer period.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) plays a significant role in addressing consumer concerns about internet privacy, using its authority to protect consumers from unfair and deceptive trade practices. However, the FTC's approach has limitations, and some stakeholders argue that a comprehensive federal privacy statute is needed to establish general requirements governing internet privacy practices. The passage also notes that the FTC's enforcement approach focuses on enforcing a statute rather than implementing regulations, which can limit the agency's ability to affect companies' behavior. Key evidence presented includes the FTC's 101 internet privacy enforcement actions between 2008 and 2018, which involved a variety of products and services collecting and using personal information from the internet. The passage concludes that a comprehensive federal privacy statute could enhance the federal government's ability to protect consumer privacy, provide more certainty in the marketplace, and provide better assurance to consumers that their privacy will be protected. Unique points made include the FTC's use of settlement agreements to establish precedents for companies and the importance of transparency and choice mechanisms for consumers. Overall, the passage highlights the need for a more comprehensive approach to internet privacy in the United States. \n\nSummary: Passage 2\nThe passage discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children and young people in Wales, focusing on their mental health and well-being. The Minister for Health and Social Services, Vaughan Gething, acknowledges that the pandemic has had a significant impact on children's mental health, but notes that the full picture is not yet understood due to limited contact with families. The Minister emphasizes the importance of addressing the mental health and well-being of children and young people, citing the education Minister's key principle of prioritizing their emotional health and well-being. Key evidence presented includes the Minister's statement that the health visiting service has not been stopped or stepped back, and that health visitors are maintaining contact with vulnerable families. The passage also notes that the Welsh Government is working with the third sector to provide support for children and young people, including the Childline service, which has seen a 50% increase in calls related to COVID-19. Unique points made include the Minister's commitment to addressing the mental health and well-being of children and young people, and the importance of maintaining contact with vulnerable families during the pandemic.

This disclosure followed other recent incidents involving the misuse of consumers' personal information from the Internet, which is used by about three-quarters of Americans. GAO was asked to review federal oversight of Internet privacy. This report addresses, among other objectives: (1) how FTC and FCC have overseen consumers' Internet privacy and (2) selected stakeholders' views on the strengths and limitations of how Internet privacy currently is overseen and how, if it all, this approach could be enhanced. GAO evaluated FTC and FCC Internet privacy enforcement actions and authorities and interviewed representatives from industry, consumer advocacy groups, and academia; FTC and FCC staff; former FTC and FCC commissioners; and officials from other federal oversight agencies. Industry stakeholders were selected to represent different sectors, and academics were selected because of their expertise in privacy, consumer protection, and regulatory issues. The United States does not have a comprehensive Internet privacy law governing the collection, use, and sale or other disclosure of consumers' personal information. At the federal level, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) currently has the lead in overseeing Internet privacy, using its statutory authority under the FTC Act to protect consumers from unfair and deceptive trade practices. However, to date FTC has not issued regulations for Internet privacy other than those protecting financial privacy and the Internet privacy of children, which were required by law. For FTC Act violations, FTC may promulgate regulations but is required to use procedures that differ from traditional notice-and-comment processes and that FTC staff said add time and complexity. In the last decade, FTC has filed 101 enforcement actions regarding Internet privacy; nearly all actions resulted in settlement agreements requiring action by the companies. In most of these cases, FTC did not levy civil penalties because it lacked such authority for those particular violations. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has had a limited role in overseeing Internet privacy. From 2015 to 2017, FCC asserted jurisdiction over the privacy practices of Internet service providers. In 2016, FCC promulgated privacy rules for Internet service providers that Congress later repealed. FTC resumed privacy oversight of Internet service providers in June 2018. Stakeholders GAO interviewed had varied views on the current Internet privacy enforcement approach and how it could be enhanced. Most Internet industry stakeholders said they favored FTC's current approach—direct enforcement of its unfair and deceptive practices statutory authority, rather than promulgating and enforcing regulations implementing that authority. These stakeholders said that the current approach allows for flexibility and that regulations could hinder innovation. Other stakeholders, including consumer advocates and most former FTC and FCC commissioners GAO interviewed, favored having FTC issue and enforce regulations. Some stakeholders said a new data-protection agency was needed to oversee consumer privacy. Stakeholders identified three main areas in which Internet privacy oversight could be enhanced: Statute . Some stakeholders told GAO that an overarching Internet privacy statute could enhance consumer protection by clearly articulating to consumers, industry, and agencies what behaviors are prohibited. Rulemaking . Some stakeholders said that regulations can provide clarity, enforcement fairness, and flexibility. Officials from two other consumer protection agencies said their rulemaking authority assists in their oversight efforts and works together with enforcement actions. Civil penalty authority. Some stakeholders said FTC's Internet privacy enforcement could be more effective with authority to levy civil penalties for first-time violations of the FTC Act. Comprehensive Internet privacy legislation that establishes specific standards and includes traditional notice-and-comment rulemaking and broader civil penalty authority could enhance the federal government's ability to protect consumer privacy. Congress should consider developing comprehensive legislation on Internet privacy that would enhance consumer protections and provide flexibility to address a rapidly evolving Internet environment. Issues that should be considered include what authorities agencies should have in order to oversee Internet privacy, including appropriate rulemaking authority."], "length": 27214}

The review found that the medical centers lacked documentation for almost half of the reviews conducted, and in some cases, the required reviews were not conducted at all. The main argument is that the VA medical centers are not adequately documenting and conducting reviews of providers' clinical care, which can lead to inadequate oversight and potentially harm patients. The key evidence presented includes the lack of documentation for 26 providers who were supposed to undergo focused professional practice evaluations (FPPEs) for cause, and the failure to conduct reviews for 16 providers for 3 months or more after concerns were raised about their care. The unique point made in the passage is that VHA policy does not require documentation of all types of reviews, and VHA's oversight of the reviews is inadequate. The passage concludes that the VA medical centers need to improve their documentation and oversight of clinical care reviews to ensure that providers are held accountable for their care. The recommended solutions include requiring documentation of all reviews, establishing a timeliness requirement for initiating reviews, and strengthening VHA's oversight of the reviews. The VA concurred with these recommendations and plans to revise existing policy and update the standardized audit tool used by the networks. Passage 4 discusses the history and application of the Holman rule in the House of Representatives. The main argument is that the Holman rule is a complex and nuanced rule that has been interpreted and applied in various ways over the years. The key evidence presented includes the history of the rule, including its adoption in 1835 and its modification in 1876, 1880, and 1983. The unique point made in the passage is that the rule has been incrementally narrowed in its application over time, and its current form allows for retrenchments that reduce expenditures by reducing the number and salary of officers or the compensation of any person paid out of the Treasury.

{"pred": " Passage 4\nThe National Academies' 2006 report on radiation and human health concluded that the balance of evidence favors a simple proportionate relationship between radiation at low doses and cancer risk. However, accurately estimating cancer risks from very low doses of radiation exposure is challenging due to uncertainties in extrapolating data from non-U.S. populations to a U.S. population. Despite these challenges, federal agencies, including NRC and EPA, continue to follow the linear no-threshold model, which assumes that the risk of cancer increases with every incremental increase in radiation exposure. The model is used to set dose limits for radiation exposure, which are below the level considered low dose by the National Academies. The agencies also apply the principle that doses should be kept as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) to minimize radiation exposure. However, funding for research on the health effects of low-dose radiation has decreased over the past five years, with a 48% decrease in annual funding obligations from $57.9 million in fiscal year 2012 to $30.4 million in fiscal year 2016. The GAO recommends that the Secretary of Energy lead the development of a mechanism for interagency collaboration to determine roles and responsibilities for addressing priorities related to research on the health effects of low-dose radiation. This recommendation aims to improve coordination and communication among federal agencies to address shared research priorities and reduce uncertainty in predicting cancer risk from low-dose radiation. The GAO believes that DOE is well-positioned to lead this effort due to its past experience as a leader in this area of research and its primary responsibility under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 for research related to the protection of health during activities that can result in exposure to radiation. However, DOE did not agree with the recommendation, citing its legal mandates and budget authorities, but the GAO believes that this mechanism would help agencies address shared research priorities without replacing their existing authorities.  The GAO continues to believe that an interagency coordination mechanism for low-dose research is needed and that DOE is in the best position to lead agencies in developing the most appropriate mechanism.

The Department of Energy (DOE), Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Food and Drug Administration generally used the advice of scientific advisory bodies to develop and apply radiation protection requirements and guidance for workers and the public in the radiation exposure settings that GAO reviewed. These settings were: (1) the operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants; (2) the cleanup of sites with radiological contamination; (3) the use of medical equipment that produces radiation; and (4) accidental or terrorism-related exposure to radiation. Specifically, the agencies relied on the advice of three scientific advisory bodies that supported the use of a model that assumes the risk of cancer increases with every incremental radiation exposure. Accordingly, the agencies have set regulatory dose limits and issued guidance to confine exposure to levels that reduce the risk of cancer, while recognizing that scientific uncertainties occur in estimating cancer risks from low-dose radiation. For example, NRC requires nuclear power plants to consider measures for limiting workers' exposure below NRC's regulatory dose limit, such as by using robots for maintenance work in radiation areas. GAO identified seven federal agencies that funded research on low-dose radiation's health effects. In fiscal years 2012 to 2016, DOE, NRC, EPA, and four other federal agencies obligated about $210 million for such research . Although the agencies have collaborated on individual projects on radiation's health effects, they have not established a collaborative mechanism to set research priorities. GAO's previous work has shown that federal agencies can use such mechanisms to implement interagency collaboration to develop and coordinate sound science policies. In the past, DOE took a leading role in this area because DOE provided stable funding and advocated for greater coordination on research on low-dose radiation's health effects. However, since fiscal year 2012, DOE has phased out funding for one of its main research programs in this area. This has created a void in coordination efforts among federal agencies, and no other agency has stepped forward to fill this void. Because of DOE's prior experience as a leader in this area of research and its research responsibility under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, it could play an important role in helping federal agencies establish a coordinating mechanism for low-dose radiation research.

The main objective of these transactions was tax savings, and they involved little to no shift in actual economic activity. Bermuda and the Cayman Islands (countries with no corporate income tax) were the locations of many of the newly created parent corporations. These types of inversions largely ended with the enactment of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (JOBS Act; P.L. 108-357), which denied the tax benefits of an inversion if the original U.S. stockholders owned 80% or more of the new firm. The act effectively ended shifts to tax havens where no real business activity took place. However, two avenues for inverting remained. The act allowed a firm to invert if it has substantial business operations in the country where the new parent was to be located; the regulations at one point set a 10% level of these business operations. Several inversions using the business activity test resulted in Treasury regulations in 2012 that increased the activity requirement to 25%, effectively closing off this method. Firms could also invert by merging with a foreign company if the original U.S. stockholders owned less than 80% of the new firm. If the original U.S. shareholders owned less than 60%, the firm was not considered as inverting. Two features made a country an attractive destination: a low corporate tax rate and a territorial tax system that did not tax foreign source income. The U.K. joined countries such as Ireland, Switzerland, and Canada as targets for inverting when it adopted a territorial tax in 2009. At the same time, the U.K. also lowered its rate (from 25% to 20% by 2015). Inverted firms could reduce worldwide taxes by stripping taxable earnings out of the new U.S. subsidiary, largely through allocating debt to that subsidiary. Soon after, several high-profile companies indicated an interest in merging with a non-U.S. headquartered company, including Pfizer, Chiquita, AbbVie, and Burger King. This \"second wave\" of inversions again raised concerns about an erosion of the U.S. tax base. Chiquita and AbbVie canceled their plans in the wake of 2014 Treasury regulations, but Burger King and other firms completed merger plans. Pfizer subsequently terminated its planned merger with Allergan after Treasury regulations issued in 2016. Evidence suggests that these Treasury regulations have been an important factor in subsequently decreasing these merger-related inversions. Two policy options had been discussed in response: a general reform of the U.S. corporate tax and specific provisions to deal with tax-motivated international mergers. In December 2017, P.L. 115-97 (popularly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) lowered the corporate tax rate as part of broader tax reform which some argued would slow the rate of inversions. Other tax reform proposals suggested that if the United States moved to a territorial tax, the incentive to invert would be eliminated. There were concerns that a territorial tax could worsen the profit-shifting that already exists among multinational firms. P.L. 115-97, while moving in some ways to a territorial tax, also instituted a number of measures aimed at combatting profit shifting, including a global minimum tax on intangible income that limited the tax benefits of a territorial tax. The second option is to directly target inversions. The 2017 act included several provisions that discouraged inversions. In addition, further anti-inversion provisions have been introduced, most recently H.R. 5108 and S. 2459 in the 115th Congress, to treat all firms in which former U.S. shareholders have more than 50% ownership (or in which management and control is in the United States) as U.S. firms.

The inventors have identified that high sucrose content inhibits the activity of anti-staling amylases, such as Novamyl, making them less effective in preventing staling of dough-based products. They have designed sucrose-tolerant variants of maltogenic alpha-amylase by analyzing the 3D structure of Novamyl and identifying specific binding configurations of sucrose in the active site. The variants have been tested for their ability to hydrolyze amylose and retain activity in the presence of sucrose. The patent application also describes the properties of the sucrose-tolerant amylases, including their ability to hydrolyze amylose, retain activity in the presence of sucrose, and have optimal activity in a pH range of 4.5-8.5.

GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care. For example, GAO found that after one VAMC failed to report to the NPDB or SLBs a provider who resigned to avoid an adverse privileging action, a non-VA hospital in the same city took an adverse privileging action against that same provider for the same reason 2 years later."], "length": 26603}

The TAO-205 class design will have capabilities similar to those of the Kaiser-class ships and will rely on existing technologies. The Navy's FY2020 budget submission estimates the total procurement cost of the 20 planned TAO-205s at $12,196.1 million, or an average of $609.8 million each. The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget requests $1,057.9 million in procurement funding for the TAO-205 program, including $981.2 million for the fifth and sixth ships and $73.0 million in advance procurement funding for future fiscal years. The Navy's new operational concept, Distributed Maritime Operations (DMO), could lead to the development of a fleet with larger numbers of individually smaller ships and to more-widely dispersed Navy operations, affecting requirements for Navy logistics, including oilers. The Navy has not assessed the effects of DMO on logistics force requirements and modifying its force structure plans accordingly, risking being unprepared to provide required fuel and other supplies.

{"pred": " Passage 2\nThe U.S. corporate income tax system has been subject to corporate inversions, where a U.S. corporation changes its country of residence to a foreign country with a lower tax rate. This has led to concerns about the erosion of the U.S. tax base and the perceived fairness of the tax system. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA) was enacted to address these concerns, but it did not completely eliminate inversions. The AJCA denied tax benefits to inversions where the owners of the new company were not substantially different from the owners of the original company. However, some companies have successfully inverted by using the substantial business operations mechanism or merging. The Treasury Department has released regulations to restrict inversions and their benefits, but these regulations have been subject to changes and revisions. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 made major changes to the corporate tax and international tax rules, including the adoption of the Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse tax (BEAT) and the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) regime. The TCJA also made changes to the rules governing inversions, including the requirement that a firm must have substantial business operations in the country where the new headquarters is located. The Treasury Department has continued to regulate inversions, and some companies have announced plans to merge or invert, but the pace of inversions has slowed significantly since the TCJA was enacted. The TCJA has also made it more difficult for companies to invert by reducing the tax benefits of inversions and increasing the tax rate on foreign earnings. Overall, the U.S. corporate income tax system remains vulnerable to inversions, and further changes may be needed to address this issue. Key evidence presented includes data on the number of inversions and the tax benefits of inversions, as well as the impact of the TCJA on the corporate tax system. Unique points made include the use of the substantial business operations mechanism and the adoption of the BEAT and GILTI regimes. Innovative points include the use of the multiple-entity rule and the serial inversion rule to restrict inversions. The summary focuses on the main arguments and conclusions of the passage, highlighting the key evidence and unique points made. It provides a concise overview of the issue of corporate inversions and the changes made to the U.S. corporate income tax system. The summary also highlights the ongoing efforts of the Treasury Department to regulate inversions and the impact of the TCJA on the corporate tax system. The summary is", "answers": ["News reports in the late 1990s and early 2000s drew attention to a phenomenon sometimes called corporate \"inversions\" or \"expatriations\": instances where U.S. firms reorganize their structure so that the \"parent\" element of the group is a foreign corporation rather than a corporation chartered in the United States. The main objective of these transactions was tax savings, and they involved little to no shift in actual economic activity. Bermuda and the Cayman Islands (countries with no corporate income tax) were the locations of many of the newly created parent corporations. These types of inversions largely ended with the enactment of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (JOBS Act; P.L. 108-357), which denied the tax benefits of an inversion if the original U.S. stockholders owned 80% or more of the new firm. The act effectively ended shifts to tax havens where no real business activity took place. However, two avenues for inverting remained. The act allowed a firm to invert if it has substantial business operations in the country where the new parent was to be located; the regulations at one point set a 10% level of these business operations. Several inversions using the business activity test resulted in Treasury regulations in 2012 that increased the activity requirement to 25%, effectively closing off this method. Firms could also invert by merging with a foreign company if the original U.S. stockholders owned less than 80% of the new firm. If the original U.S. shareholders owned less than 60%, the firm was not considered as inverting. Two features made a country an attractive destination: a low corporate tax rate and a territorial tax system that did not tax foreign source income. The U.K. joined countries such as Ireland, Switzerland, and Canada as targets for inverting when it adopted a territorial tax in 2009. At the same time, the U.K. also lowered its rate (from 25% to 20% by 2015). Inverted firms could reduce worldwide taxes by stripping taxable earnings out of the new U.S. subsidiary, largely through allocating debt to that subsidiary. Soon after, several high-profile companies indicated an interest in merging with a non-U.S. headquartered company, including Pfizer, Chiquita, AbbVie, and Burger King. This \"second wave\" of inversions again raised concerns about an erosion of the U.S. tax base. Chiquita and AbbVie canceled their plans in the wake of 2014 Treasury regulations, but Burger King and other firms completed merger plans. Pfizer subsequently terminated its planned merger with Allergan after Treasury regulations issued in 2016. Evidence suggests that these Treasury regulations have been an important factor in subsequently decreasing these merger-related inversions. Two policy options had been discussed in response: a general reform of the U.S. corporate tax and specific provisions to deal with tax-motivated international mergers. In December 2017, P.L. 115-97 (popularly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) lowered the corporate tax rate as part of broader tax reform which some argued would slow the rate of inversions. Other tax reform proposals suggested that if the United States moved to a territorial tax, the incentive to invert would be eliminated. There were concerns that a territorial tax could worsen the profit-shifting that already exists among multinational firms. P.L. 115-97, while moving in some ways to a territorial tax, also instituted a number of measures aimed at combatting profit shifting, including a global minimum tax on intangible income that limited the tax benefits of a territorial tax. The second option is to directly target inversions. The 2017 act included several provisions that discouraged inversions. In addition, further anti-inversion provisions have been introduced, most recently H.R. 5108 and S. 2459 in the 115th Congress, to treat all firms in which former U.S. shareholders have more than 50% ownership (or in which management and control is in the United States) as U.S. firms. These bills also provided that debt could also be allocated to the U.S. member of a worldwide operation in proportion to the U.S. ownership of assets."], "length": 26279}
{"pred": " \nPassage 3 discusses the Fire Management Assistance Grant (FMAG) system, which provides federal assistance for fire suppression activities. The system was established by regulation in October 2001, and the President has the authority to declare a FMAG under Section 420 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. The FMAG declaration authorizes various forms of federal assistance, including the provision of equipment, personnel, and grants to state, local, and tribal governments for the control, management, and mitigation of fires on public or private forest land or grassland. The decision to issue a FMAG declaration is not contingent on the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) balance, and FMAGs do not reduce the amount of funding available for major disasters. The cost-share for FMAGs is based on a federal share of 75% of eligible expenses, with the remaining 25% assumed by the state and subgrantees. The FMAG process involves a request for assistance, evaluation using thresholds, and the provision of various forms of federal assistance. The system has undergone changes, including the amendment of the Stafford Act to make hazard mitigation available for FMAG declarations. The FMAG system is a direct relationship between the federal government and states to assist in fighting fires on state lands, and it is employed to avoid the need for a disaster declaration. The system provides financial and technical assistance to state partners, and it is not generally available in conjunction with emergency suppression assistance from the Forest Service or other federal agencies. However, FMAGs may be provided in conjunction with other Forest Service assistance programs, such as technical and financial assistance provided through the agency's state and volunteer fire assistance programs. The FMAG system has unique features, including the use of thresholds to determine eligibility for assistance and the provision of hazard mitigation grants to states and tribes on a sliding scale based on the percentage of funds spent for FMAG assistance.

As of April 2017, about 2.5% of eligible entities had registered to use disposal bins, with pharmacies making up about 81% of authorized collectors. The participation rate varied by state, with North Dakota having the highest rate at 32%. The DEA's regulations require that controlled substances collected in the disposal bins be destroyed in compliance with federal, state, and local laws, and that the inner liners be rendered non-retrievable. However, stakeholders reported that the costs associated with participating in the program, uncertainty over proper implementation, and participation in other disposal efforts were factors that contributed to the low participation rate. The DEA has provided guidance on the program, but stakeholders noted that some DEA requirements may conflict with other state and federal requirements.

About half of the people who reported misusing prescription drugs in 2015 received them from a friend or relative. One way to help prevent this kind of diversion and potential misuse is by providing secure and convenient ways to dispose of unused, unneeded, or expired prescription medications. The Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010 authorizes pharmacies and other entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances to also collect unused prescription drugs for disposal. In 2014, DEA finalized regulations for the implementation of the Act, establishing a voluntary process for eligible entities to become authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs using disposal bins. GAO was asked to review participation among authorized collectors that maintain disposal bins. In this report GAO describes (1) participation rates among entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs and (2) factors that affect participation. GAO analyzed the most currently available DEA data from April 2017 on entities eligible to participate and those participating as authorized collectors. GAO also conducted interviews with DEA officials and a nongeneralizable sample of 11 stakeholder organizations selected to illustrate different types of authorized collectors and long-term care facilities. GAO is not making any recommendations. DEA provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. GAO found that about 3 percent of pharmacies and other entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs for disposal have volunteered to do so. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) authorizes these entities to dispose of unused drugs to help reduce their potential misuse. Analysis of DEA data shows that as of April 2017, 2,233 of the 89,550 (2.49 percent) eligible entities—that is, certain entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances—had registered with DEA to use disposal bins to collect unused prescription drugs. Most—about 81 percent—of the authorized collectors were pharmacies, followed by hospitals or clinics. GAO also found that participation rates varied by state, though in 44 states less than 5 percent of the state's pharmacies and other eligible entities had registered to become authorized collectors. Stakeholders cited several factors that may explain why relatively few pharmacies and other eligible entities have registered with DEA as authorized collectors of unused drugs. Most notably, stakeholders representing authorized collectors told GAO that because participation is voluntary, the cost associated with maintaining a disposal bin—which includes purchasing and installing the bin according to DEA requirements and paying for the destruction of its contents—is an important factor to weigh against potential benefits.

DHS inspects high-risk facilities after it approves facility security plans to ensure that the facilities are implementing required security measures and procedures. This statement summarizes progress and challenges related to DHS's CFATS program management. This statement is based on prior products GAO issued from July 2012 through June 2017, along with updates conducted in June 2018 on DHS actions to address prior GAO recommendations. To conduct the prior work, GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and DHS policies for administering the CFATS program, how DHS assesses risk, and data on high-risk chemical facilities. GAO also interviewed DHS officials and reviewed information on DHS actions to implement its prior recommendations. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has made progress addressing challenges that GAO's past work identified to managing the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) program. The following summarizes progress made and challenges remaining in key aspects of the program. Identifying high-risk chemical facilities. In July 2015, GAO reported that DHS used self-reported and unverified data to determine the risk of facilities holding toxic chemicals that could threaten surrounding communities if released. GAO recommended that DHS should better verify the accuracy of facility-reported data. DHS implemented this recommendation by revising its methodology so it now calculates the risk of toxic release, rather than relying on facilities to do so. Assessing risk and prioritizing facilities. In April 2013, GAO reported weaknesses in multiple aspects of DHS's risk assessment and prioritization approach. GAO made two recommendations for DHS to review and improve this process, including that DHS enhance its risk assessment approach to incorporate all of the elements of consequence, threat, and vulnerability associated with a terrorist attack involving certain chemicals. DHS launched a new risk assessment methodology in October 2016 and is currently gathering new or updated data from about 27,000 facilities to (1) determine which facilities should be categorized as high-risk because of the threat of sabotage, theft or diversion, or a toxic release and (2) assign those facilities deemed high risk to one of four risk-based tiers. GAO has ongoing work assessing these efforts and will report later this summer on the extent to which they fully address prior recommendations. Reviewing and approving facilities' site security plans . DHS is to review security plans and visit facilities to ensure their security measures meet DHS standards. In April 2013, GAO reported a 7 to 9 year backlog for these reviews and visits. In July 2015, GAO reported that DHS had made substantial progress in addressing the backlog—estimating that it could take between 9 and 12 months for DHS to review and approve security plans for the approximately 900 remaining facilities. DHS has since taken additional action to expedite these activities and has eliminated this backlog. Inspecting facilities and ensuring compliance. In July 2015, GAO reported that DHS conducted compliance inspections at 83 of the 1,727 facilities with approved security plans. GAO found that nearly half of the inspected facilities were not fully compliant with their approved security plans and that DHS did not have documented procedures for managing facilities' compliance. GAO recommended that DHS document procedures for managing compliance. As a result, DHS has developed an enforcement procedure and a draft compliance inspection procedure and expects to finalize the compliance inspection procedure by the end of fiscal year 2018. GAO has made various recommendations to strengthen DHS's management of the CFATS program, with which DHS has generally agreed.

This is about 20 years sooner than projected under the Navy's FY2019 30-year shipbuilding plan—an acceleration primarily due to a decision announced by the Navy in April 2018, after the FY2019 plan was submitted, to increase the service lives of all DDG-51 destroyers to 45 years. Although the Navy projects that the fleet will reach a total of 355 ships in FY2034, the Navy in that year and subsequent years will not match the composition called for in the FY2016 FSA. One issue for Congress is whether the new FSA that the Navy is conducting will change the 355-ship force-level objective established by the 2016 FSA and, if so, in what ways. Another oversight issue for Congress concerns the prospective affordability of the Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan.

Members of Parliament expressed outrage and horror over the conditions in long-term care homes, citing reports from the Canadian Armed Forces detailing neglect, abuse, and filth. The Minister of Health, Patty Hajdu, acknowledged the severity of the situation and committed to working with provinces and territories to improve care for seniors. However, the NDP's Don Davies pressed for immediate action, calling for a binding national standard for long-term care and for the Minister to refer the matter to the RCMP for investigation. The Minister of Public Safety, Bill Blair, responded that the province of Ontario had initiated an investigation and that the federal government would continue to work with the province to protect seniors in long-term care facilities. The debate highlighted the need for improved care and accountability in long-term care facilities, with many MPs calling for a shift away from the for-profit model and towards a more compassionate and dignified approach to caring for seniors. Key evidence presented included reports from the Canadian Armed Forces detailing the conditions in long-term care homes, as well as data on the high number of COVID-19 deaths in long-term care facilities.

The investigation found that the medical centers had inadequate documentation and untimely reviews of providers' clinical care, which compromised the safety of veterans. The GAO found that the VA medical centers lacked documentation of reviews for 26 providers, and that 16 providers had reviews initiated 3 months or more after concerns were raised about their care. The investigation also found that the VA medical centers failed to report 9 providers to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) and state licensing boards as required, despite documenting significant clinical deficiencies in their care. The GAO concluded that VHA lacks reasonable assurance that all providers who should be reported to these entities are reported, and that this failure facilitates providers who provide substandard care at one facility obtaining privileges at another VA medical center or at hospitals outside of VA's health care system. The GAO recommended that VHA require documentation of all reviews of providers' clinical care", "answers": ["The opposition party questioned about sending military groups to provinces in order to fix long-term care.

{"pred": " Passage 2\nThis patent describes a method for sizing liposomes using an aluminum oxide porous film. The film has a branched-pore structure, with larger pores extending from one face and smaller pores extending from the other face. The smaller pores have a uniform minimum diameter, which is the size rating of the film. The method involves passing a suspension of liposomes through the film under pressure, with the liposomes entering through the smaller pores and exiting through the larger pores. The process can be repeated multiple times to achieve a desired particle size distribution. The patent also describes a preferred apparatus for carrying out the method, which includes a filter assembly, a supply means, and a receiving means. The apparatus can be used to extrude liposomes at high flow rates under relatively low pressure. The patent also discusses the advantages of using aluminum oxide filters over previously known polycarbonate filters, including higher flow rates and lower pressure requirements. The patent includes several examples of the method and apparatus, including a comparison of the performance of aluminum oxide filters and polycarbonate filters. The results show that the aluminum oxide filters require fewer passes and higher flow rates to achieve the same particle size distribution as the polycarbonate filters. The patent concludes that the method and apparatus provide a rapid and efficient way to size liposomes, and that the use of aluminum oxide filters offers several advantages over previously known methods.  The patent also discusses the orientation of the filter, with the liposomes entering through the smaller pores and exiting through the larger pores, and the results show that this orientation is more efficient than the opposite orientation.

{"pred": " Passage 1\nMultiyear procurement (MYP) and block buy contracting (BBC) are special contracting mechanisms used by the Department of Defense (DOD) for a limited number of defense acquisition programs. These mechanisms can reduce weapon procurement costs by a few or several percent compared to annual contracting. The use of MYP and BBC is governed by a permanent statute (10 U.S.C. 2306b) and DOD acquisition regulations. To qualify for MYP, a program must meet several criteria, including significant savings, realistic cost estimates, stable need for the items, and stable design for the items. The statute requires that DOD MYP contracts be fixed-price type contracts. The use of MYP can reduce costs by allowing contractors to optimize their workforce and production facilities and by permitting economic order quantity (EOQ) purchases of selected long-leadtime components. However, using MYP can reduce Congress's and DOD's flexibility for making changes in procurement programs in future years. The Navy has made extensive use of MYP and BBC in its ship and aircraft acquisition programs, reducing costs by billions of dollars. The Coast Guard has not used MYP or BBC in its ship or aircraft acquisition programs, but CRS estimates that using multiyear contracting rather than contracts with options for the entire 25-ship OPC program could reduce the cost of the OPC program by about $1 billion. The National Emergencies Act of 1976 established a procedure for the presidential declaration and congressional regulation of a national emergency.

Compared to the standard or default approach of annual contracting, MYP and BBC have the potential for reducing weapon procurement costs by a few or several percent. Under annual contracting, DOD uses one or more contracts for each year's worth of procurement of a given kind of item. Under MYP, DOD instead uses a single contract for two to five years' worth of procurement of a given kind of item without having to exercise a contract option for each year after the first year. DOD needs congressional approval for each use of MYP. There is a permanent statute governing MYP contracting—10 U.S.C. 2306b. Under this statute, a program must meet several criteria to qualify for MYP. Compared with estimated costs under annual contracting, estimated savings for programs being proposed for MYP have ranged from less than 5% to more than 15%, depending on the particulars of the program in question, with many estimates falling in the range of 5% to 10%. In practice, actual savings from using MYP rather than annual contracting can be difficult to observe or verify because of cost growth during the execution of the contract due to changes in the program independent of the use of MYP rather than annual contracting. BBC is similar to MYP in that it permits DOD to use a single contract for more than one year's worth of procurement of a given kind of item without having to exercise a contract option for each year after the first year. BBC is also similar to MYP in that DOD needs congressional approval for each use of BBC. BBC differs from MYP in the following ways: There is no permanent statute governing the use of BBC. There is no requirement that BBC be approved in both a DOD appropriations act and an act other than a DOD appropriations act. Programs being considered for BBC do not need to meet any legal criteria to qualify for BBC, because there is no permanent statute governing the use of BBC that establishes such criteria. A BBC contract can cover more than five years of planned procurements. Economic order quantity (EOQ) authority—the authority to bring forward selected key components of the items to be procured under the contract and purchase the components in batch form during the first year or two of the contract—does not come automatically as part of BBC authority because there is no permanent statute governing the use of BBC that includes EOQ authority as an automatic feature. BBC contracts are less likely to include cancellation penalties. Potential issues for Congress concerning MYP and BBC include whether to use MYP and BBC in the future more frequently, less frequently, or about as frequently as they are currently used; whether to create a permanent statute to govern the use of BBC, analogous to the permanent statute that governs the use of MYP; and whether the Coast Guard should begin making use of MYP and BBC."], "length": 26900}

However, USDA faces several challenges in pursuing its FMD response goals, including surveillance challenges, diagnostic challenges, information management challenges, traceability challenges, biosecurity challenges, depopulation challenges, disposal challenges, resource challenges, and communication and coordination challenges. To mitigate these challenges, USDA has identified corrective actions, but has not consistently followed its SOP to prioritize and monitor corrective actions. The USDA's Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) should follow the agency's SOP to prioritize corrective actions for FMD preparedness and monitor progress and track completion of corrective actions. The USDA has a comprehensive Public Transportation Safety Program, which relies on state safety agencies to monitor rail transit systems' safety operations. However, limitations have been identified in the state safety oversight program, including a lack of qualified staff and adequate levels of training. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) oversees safety of railroads operating on the general system, while the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) oversees safety of rail transit systems. FRA has developed extensive railroad safety regulations, while FTA is currently assessing the need for rail transit safety regulations. FTA has finalized regulations implementing the public transportation safety program authorized by statute, but lacks federal rail transit safety regulations, which may contribute to inconsistent safety practices across the rail transit industry. The FTA's rail transit safety oversight program is currently in transition as the agency implements new authorities and responsibilities provided in federal law. To improve its efforts, FTA should create a plan with a timeline for developing guidance for state safety agencies on how to develop and implement a risk-based inspection program and develop and communicate a method for monitoring the effectiveness of state safety agencies' enforcement.

FRA, also in DOT, has long carried out safety oversight of freight, intercity passenger, and commuter railroads.

This report examines (1) key characteristics of FRA's and FTA's rail safety oversight programs and (2) strengths and limitations of FRA's and FTA's rail safety oversight programs. GAO assessed FRA's and FTA's information about rail safety oversight activities against guidance from the Office of Management and Budget, leading practices developed by the transit industry, and federal standards for internal control. GAO also interviewed stakeholders, including rail operators chosen based on mode, size, and location. The Department of Transportation's (DOT) Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) and Federal Transit Administration (FTA) carry out different approaches to rail safety oversight. FRA has a more centralized safety oversight program for railroads, while FTA's program for oversight of rail transit safety largely relies on state safety agencies to monitor and enforce rail transit safety, as established in federal statute. Key characteristics of both programs include: (1) safety regulations, (2) inspections and other oversight activities, and (3) enforcement mechanisms to ensure that safety deficiencies are addressed (see figure). There are strengths and limitations to FRA's and FTA's approaches to their safety oversight missions, including how the two agencies develop safety regulations, conduct inspections, and carry out enforcement. The National Transportation Safety Board has reported, and stakeholders GAO spoke with generally agreed, that strengths of FRA's rail safety oversight program include its safety regulations, its risk-based inspection program, and its enforcement authorities. FRA also has potential limitations in its oversight framework, though, such as difficulty evaluating the effectiveness of its enforcement mechanisms. FTA has made some progress implementing changes to the rail transit safety program. However, FTA has not provided all the necessary guidance and support to states' safety agencies to ensure they develop appropriate and effective rail transit safety inspection programs. In particular, FTA has not provided states with guidance on how to develop and implement risk-based inspection programs. Though FTA has said that it will develop such guidance, it does not have a plan or timeline to do so. Without guidance from FTA on how to develop and carry out risk-based inspections, state safety agencies may not allocate their limited resources efficiently, and important safety issues may go undetected. In addition, FTA has not developed a process or methodology to evaluate whether state safety agency enforcement authorities and practices are effective. Without clear evidence that state safety agencies' enforcement is effective, states and FTA may not be able to compel rail transit operators to remedy safety deficiencies. As a result, deficiencies may remain for long periods, potentially contributing to safety incidents.

Estimation of improper payments is key to understanding the extent of the problem and to developing effective corrective actions. Relevant laws and guidance provide agencies flexibility in developing estimates. This report describes agencies' processes to estimate improper payments in selected programs for fiscal year 2017 and the extent to which certain differences in these processes can affect the usefulness of the resulting estimates. GAO selected 10 programs across six agencies with the largest reported program outlays in fiscal years 2015 and 2016. For these programs, GAO reviewed relevant laws and guidance, analyzed agencies' policies and procedures, and interviewed officials at relevant agencies and OMB staff. The six agencies GAO reviewed reported taking various approaches related to key components of estimating improper payments—shown in the figure below—for 10 selected programs, which collectively reported outlays of over $2.5 trillion for fiscal year 2017. Sample selection. Eight of the 10 programs GAO reviewed reported using statistically valid approaches, and the remaining 2 reported using alternative methodologies approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The sampled data elements varied, including payments, medical claims, and tax returns. The age of the data used to develop fiscal year 2017 improper payment estimates also varied, ranging from calendar year 2013 to fiscal year 2017. Identification of improper payments. Some of the six agencies reported using processes designed specifically to estimate improper payments, whereas others reported leveraging existing reviews. These agencies' policies and procedures include a review of aspects of eligibility, except for those related to the Department of Defense's (DOD) Military Pay and the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) Retirement overpayments. DOD and OPM have not fully assessed whether their estimation processes effectively consider key program risks. OMB guidance does not specifically address how agencies are to test to identify improper payments, such as using a risk-based approach to help ensure that key risks of improper payments are addressed. The six agencies also varied in the treatment of insufficient documentation, both in identifying and in reporting the root causes of improper payments. For the agencies that contact entities outside the agency to estimate improper payments, the treatment of nonresponse differed, with one agency including nonresponses as improper payments and another generally excluding the nonresponse cases from review. Although OMB guidance states that agencies should treat cases of insufficient documentation as improper payments, it does not specifically address the treatment of nonresponse cases. Calculation of the improper payment estimate. The six agencies generally reported using law and OMB guidance to calculate improper payment estimates for the selected programs, except for the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) removed overpayments that were recovered when developing its estimate. OMB guidance requires agencies to include recovered amounts in their estimates. Removing these overpayments understates the EITC improper payment estimate and may limit IRS's ability to develop corrective actions to prevent improper payments. GAO recommends that OMB develop guidance on treatment of nonresponse cases and testing to identify improper payments, that DOD and OPM assess their estimation processes, and that IRS revise its methodology to not exclude recovered payments from its estimate.

{"pred": " Passage 1\nThe federal government collects various fees and other charges from businesses and households. These fees are used to fund public activities and can be voluntary or compulsory. User fees have several advantages, including being voluntary, connecting the burden of financing activities to those who directly benefit from them, and helping to decentralize decisionmaking. However, the flow of user fees and charges may reflect fluctuations in economic conditions, and some are concerned that funding arrangements may bypass regular congressional scrutiny and dilute Congress's power of the purse. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) defines a user fee as a fee assessed to users for goods or services provided by the federal government. User fees can be classified as discretionary or mandatory spending, depending on how those fees are authorized. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provides a discussion of budget concepts related to offsetting receipts and offsetting collections, which include the bulk of user fees and charges in terms of dollar amounts. The U.S. Treasury's Bureau of the Fiscal Service issues its annual Combined Statement that reports budget data for all federal agencies at an account level as well as detailed summaries of receipts, including user fees. GAO has analyzed the administration of various user fees and has set out some principles for the design of those fees. The benefit principle, which suggests linking the fiscal burden of publicly provided benefits to those who enjoy those benefits, can promote fairness and efficiency. OMB guidelines on user fees outline aims similar to the benefit principle, mandating that federal agencies ensure that each service, sale, or use of Government goods or resources provided by an agency to specific recipients be self-sustaining. User fees may not be compulsory, but not paying them may make it impossible to carry out many activities legally. For instance, without paying passport application fees and obtaining a passport, people cannot fly to other countries. Nor can businesses issue securities without paying federal filing fees. The statutory basis for each particular fee or user charge varies in specificity and in the degree of discretion granted to the executive branch. The federal government, which operates on a modified cash accounting basis, does not recognize in its budgetary accounts the loss of asset values when it sells assets or natural resources, as a private firm would using typical business accounting methods. OMB designates whether each account receives collections associated with user charges, and that information is contained within OMB's MAX budget data system.

Choosing to raise public funds via user fees, as opposed to other means such as taxes, has important administrative and economic consequences. Many fees stem from \"business-like activities,\" in which the government provides a service or benefit in return for payment. For example, many national parks charge entry fees, which then help fund maintenance projects. Such fees and charges that result from voluntary choices, such as entering a national park, are distinguished from taxes—which stem from the government's sovereign power to compel payments. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) defines a user fee as a \"fee assessed to users for goods or services provided by the federal government. User fees generally apply to federal programs or activities that provide special benefits to identifiable recipients above and beyond what is normally available to the public.\" User fees and charges have several advantages as a means of financing public activities. They are voluntary, they connect the burden of financing activities to those who directly benefit from them, and can help decentralize decisionmaking by bypassing centralized allocation of resources. Some have expressed concerns that user fee arrangements may bypass regular congressional scrutiny and dilute Congress's power of the purse. Collections of fees and charges may also be more sensitive to economic fluctuations, which could complicate financing of programs dependent on those revenue streams. Many user fees or charges are classified as offsetting collections, which are deposited into expenditure accounts. Offsetting collections can be used to offset agency spending and typically require no further congressional approval to use. Other fees and charges are classified as offsetting receipts, which are collected into revenue accounts and typically require congressional authorization to be spent. User fees and charges can be classified as discretionary or mandatory spending, depending on how they are legally authorized. The levels and administration of some fees are specified in detailed statutory text, while other fees are created under broader agency authorities. Certain agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), have increased their reliance on user fees in past decades. Some critics have raised concerns that increased reliance on user fees could shift incentives facing those agencies. Some legislative proposals, such as H.R. 850 introduced in the 115th Congress, would limit or eliminate most exceptions and require most fees and charges to be deposited in the U.S. Treasury General Fund. Congress could fund agencies and activities now funded in whole or in part via user fees directly through the annual appropriations process. Such proposals would mark a departure from past practice. Statutory text governing many fees has evolved over many years and involves substantive policy decisions, often related to the industry or programmatic concerns. A general change in funding from user fees and charges to annual appropriations would likely shift the division of responsibilities between authorizing committees and appropriations committees. Congress may also enhance its oversight of agencies reliant on user fees by requiring more timely and detailed financial reports as well as more precise and systematic explanations of linkages between those fees and associated programs. Congress could also ask for greater transparency in fiscal data. While the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the U.S. Treasury Bureau of the Fiscal Service provide extensive data on user fees and charges, it is difficult to conduct governmentwide analyses using publicly available sources. Congress could mandate more detailed and more easily accessed data on user fees and charges. Additional funding may be needed to develop the capacity to issue those data."], "length": 25579}

GPRAMA includes a provision for GAO to review the act's implementation. This report assesses how GPRAMA implementation has affected the federal government's progress in resolving key governance challenges in (1) addressing cross-cutting issues, (2) ensuring performance information is useful and used, (3) aligning daily operations with results, and (4) building a more transparent and open government. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed statutory requirements, OMB guidance, and GAO's recent work related to GPRAMA implementation and the key governance challenges. GAO also interviewed OMB staff and surveyed a stratified random sample of 4,395 federal managers from 24 agencies on various performance and management topics. With a 67 percent response rate, the survey results are generalizable to the government-wide population of managers. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and agencies have made some progress in more fully implementing the GPRA Modernization Act (GPRAMA), but GAO's work and 2017 survey of federal managers highlight numerous areas where improvements are needed. Cross-cutting issues: Various GPRAMA provisions are aimed at addressing cross-cutting issues, such as cross-agency and agency priority goals and related data-driven reviews of progress towards those goals. To ensure alignment with the current administration's priorities, OMB's 2017 guidance removed the priority status of those goals, which stopped quarterly data-driven reviews and related public progress reports until new goals are published. OMB plans to resume implementation of these provisions in February 2018. GPRAMA also requires OMB and agencies to implement an inventory of federal programs, which could help decision makers better identify and manage fragmentation, overlap, and duplication. OMB and agencies implemented the inventory once, in May 2013. In October 2014, GAO found several issues limited the usefulness of that inventory. Since then, OMB has postponed updating the inventory, citing among other reasons the passage of subsequent laws. OMB has yet to develop a systematic approach for resuming implementation of the inventory and specific time frames for doing so. A systematic approach to developing the inventory could help ensure it provides useful information for decision makers and the public. Performance information: Survey results show federal managers generally reported no improvements in their use of performance information in decision making for various management activities, or practices that can enhance such use, since GAO's 2013 survey. For example, the use of performance information to streamline programs to reduce duplicative activities (an estimated 33 percent in 2017) is statistically significantly lower relative to 2013 (44 percent). In contrast, managers who were familiar with and whose programs were subject to quarterly data-driven reviews reported that those reviews were used to make progress toward agency priority goals. Identifying and sharing practices to expand the use of such reviews—for other performance goals and at lower levels within agencies—could lead to increased use of performance information. Daily operations: Agencies have made progress in developing results-oriented cultures but need to take additional actions. GAO's past work found that high-performing organizations use performance management systems to help individuals connect their daily activities to organizational goals. In 2017, about half of federal managers reported using performance information when setting expectations with employees (no change from GAO's last survey in 2013). Transparent and open government: GAO's past work identified a number of needed improvements to Performance.gov, the central government-wide website required by GPRAMA. The site is to provide quarterly updates on priority goals in effect through September 2017, but those updates stopped in December 2016. According to OMB, the existing information for cross-agency priority goals is the final update, and agencies should publish final updates on their priority goals in annual performance reports. Performance.gov does not provide users with this information, thereby limiting the transparency and accessibility of those results. In addition to following through on plans to resume implementation of key GPRAMA provisions, GAO recommends that OMB (1) consider a systematic approach to developing the program inventory, (2) revise guidance to provide specific time frames for inventory implementation, (3) identify and share practices for expanding the use of data-driven reviews, and (4) update Performance.gov to explain that reporting on priority goals was suspended and provide the location of final progress updates.

{"pred": " Passage 4\nThe U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) has been expanding its European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) to enhance its posture in Europe, driven by a hierarchy of national-level and DOD-specific guidance. ERI includes three elements: forces, footprint, and agreements. The DOD has requested increased funding to support planned enhancements to all three posture elements, including force deployments to Eastern Europe, new locations and improvements to infrastructure, and new host nation agreements. However, DOD's planning for ERI's posture initiatives does not establish priorities for ERI initiatives relative to those in the base budget, estimate long-term sustainment costs for some posture initiatives funded under ERI, or communicate future ERI costs to Congress. The GAO recommends that the Secretary of Defense prioritize posture initiatives under ERI relative to those funded in its base budget, develop estimates for the sustainment costs of prepositioned equipment and other infrastructure projects under ERI, and provide Congress with estimates of the future costs for posture initiatives funded under ERI. DOD partially concurred with these recommendations, but the GAO continues to believe that DOD could improve its planning for posture initiatives funded under ERI by using DOD's established posture planning processes. The GAO also notes that DOD's lack of transparency and accountability in its planning and budgeting processes for ERI initiatives may impede congressional visibility into the resources needed to fully implement these initiatives. The GAO recommends that DOD increase congressional visibility into ERI's future costs and its underlying assumptions to facilitate congressional oversight and reasonably ensure that initiatives can be sustained over the long-term. The GAO also notes that the Army and Air Force identified approximately $224 million in unspecified minor military construction and facilities maintenance and repair projects that were programmed or obligated for the European Reassurance Initiative in fiscal years 2015 through 2017.

This initiative has been funded using OCO appropriations, which Congress provides in addition to DOD's base budget appropriations. The Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying the Continuing Appropriations and Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017, included a provision for GAO to review matters related to ERI. In this report, we (1) describe changes in ERI's objectives, funding under ERI, and DOD's posture in Europe since 2014 and (2) evaluate the extent to which DOD's planning processes for posture initiatives funded under ERI prioritize those initiatives, estimate their long-term costs, and communicate their estimated costs to Congress. GAO analyzed DOD strategy documentation, budget and cost analysis guidance, budget justification materials, and cost and obligations data. GAO also interviewed knowledgeable officials within the Office of the Secretary of Defense, U.S. European Command, the military services, and the State Department. Since 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) has expanded the European Reassurance Initiative's (ERI) objectives, increased its funding, and planned enhancements to European posture. DOD expanded ERI's objectives from the short-term reassurance of allies and partners to include deterring Russian aggression in the long term and developing the capacity to field a credible combined force should deterrence fail. With respect to funding, DOD will have requested approximately $4.5 billion for ERI's posture enhancements through the end of fiscal year 2017 (about $3.2 billion for fiscal year 2017 alone), and in July 2016 EUCOM identified funding needs for future posture initiatives. The expansion of ERI's objectives has contributed to DOD's enhancing its posture in Europe. Specifically, DOD has increased the size and duration of Army combat unit deployments, planned to preposition Army equipment in Eastern Europe, added new enduring locations (e.g., locations that DOD expects to access and use to support U.S. security interests for the foreseeable future), improved infrastructure, and negotiated new agreements with European nations. As of April 2017, DOD was considering further force enhancements under ERI as part of the department's ERI budget request. DOD also was reviewing whether new enduring locations to support ERI were needed and was considering other improvements to existing infrastructure. DOD's process for planning ERI has not established priorities among posture initiatives funded under ERI relative to those in its base budget, nor estimated long-term sustainment costs for some posture initiatives funded under ERI, nor communicated future costs to Congress. ERI is being planned using a separate process from DOD's established processes and is funded from DOD's overseas contingency operations (OCO) appropriations. GAO found several weaknesses: Lack of prioritization : DOD establishes priorities among ERI posture initiatives but has not evaluated them against base budget initiatives using its posture management process. As a result, DOD lacks an understanding of the relative importance of ERI initiatives and may be investing in projects that it will not continue should OCO funding become unavailable. Lack of sustainment costs : EUCOM and the military services have not fully estimated the long-term costs to sustain equipment and construction funded under ERI. Based on DOD's approach for calculating rough order sustainment costs, GAO determined that these costs could be substantial. DOD officials said that GAO correctly applied DOD's approach for estimating sustainment costs, but noted that actual costs may be lower, because the military services may not fully fund sustainment. In the absence of comprehensive estimates, DOD has been limited in its ability to assess affordability and plan for future costs. Not communicating future costs : DOD limits Congress's visibility into the resources needed to implement ERI and achieve its objectives because it does not include future costs in its ERI budget request. This is a public version of a classified report issued in August 2017. Information on specific posture planning, guidance, and budget estimates that DOD deemed to be classified have been omitted from this report.

GAO has played a significant role in determining the applicability of the CRA, and its opinions have been used by Congress to facilitate review of rules that were not submitted to Congress. The CRA's provision barring judicial review makes it unlikely that a GAO opinion or any other congressional determination stating that a rule is subject to the CRA would be subject to challenge in court.

A joint resolution of disapproval will become effective once both houses of Congress pass a joint resolution and it is signed by the President, or if Congress overrides the President's veto. The CRA generally adopts a broad definition of the word \"rule\" from the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), defining a rule as \"the whole or a part of an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy or describing the organization, procedure, or practice requirements of an agency.\" The CRA, however, provides three exceptions to this broad definition: any rule of particular applicability, including a rule that approves or prescribes for the future rates, wages, prices, services, or allowances therefor, corporate or financial structures, reorganizations, mergers, or acquisitions thereof, or accounting practices or disclosures bearing on any of the foregoing; any rule relating to agency management or personnel; or any rule of agency organization, procedure, or practice that does not substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency parties. The class of rules the CRA covers is broader than the category of rules that are subject to the APA's notice-and-comment requirements. As such, some agency actions, such as guidance documents, that are not subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures may still be considered rules under the CRA and thus could be overturned using the CRA's procedures. The effect of Congress disapproving a rule that is not subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking may be subject to debate, given that such rules are generally viewed to lack any legal effect in the first place. Nonetheless, the CRA does encompass some such rules, as highlighted by the recent enactment of a CRA resolution overturning a bulletin from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that was not subject to the notice-and-comment procedures. Even if an agency action falls under the CRA's definition of \"rule,\" however, the expedited procedures for considering legislation to overturn the rule only become available when the agency submits the rule to Congress. In many cases in which agencies take actions that fall under the scope of a \"rule\" but have not gone through notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures, agencies fail to submit those rules. Thus, questions have arisen as to how Members can avail themselves of the CRA's special fast-track procedures if the agency has not submitted the action to Congress. To protect its prerogative to review agency rules under the CRA, Congress and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) have developed an ad hoc process in which Members can request that GAO provide a formal legal opinion on whether a particular agency action qualifies as a rule under the CRA. If GAO concludes that the action in question falls within the CRA's definition of \"rule,\" Congress has treated the publication of the GAO opinion in the Congressional Record as constructive submission of the rule.

{"pred": " Passage 2\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has taken steps to improve its website, NHTSA.gov, which provides safety recall information to consumers. However, the website usability difficulties experienced by some consumers demonstrate that NHTSA.gov does not always reflect key website usability practices. NHTSA plans to conduct a website usability study with consumers after consolidating its websites, but it has not determined a completion date for this effort. The agency has taken steps to raise consumer awareness about auto recalls, including launching a national advertising campaign and implementing a mandated 2-year pilot grant program to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of informing consumers about open auto recalls during state vehicle registration. NHTSA has also proposed a rulemaking to require auto manufacturers to notify consumers about open recalls by electronic means, such as e-mails, phone calls, and text messages, in addition to First-Class Mail. The agency has collected data on consumer preferences for receiving auto recall notifications, with 69 of 94 consumers in focus group sessions reporting a preference for receiving recall notification by electronic means. However, only 7 consumers actually received such notifications, suggesting a gap between industry notification practices and notification preferences. NHTSA has also taken steps to collaborate with industry stakeholders and explore consumer education best practices, including hosting a day-long workshop and adopting a set of Proactive Safety Principles. The agency has also issued a set of coordinated communications recommendations based on consumer research, best practices observed during the Takata recall, and discussions with manufacturers. The report concludes that NHTSA has taken important steps to improve its website and raise consumer awareness about auto recalls, but more work is needed to address website usability difficulties and improve recall completion rates.

Once a defect is identified, auto manufacturers are required to send written notification to vehicle owners by mail. NHTSA also aims to enhance awareness of auto recalls by providing information on its website, NHTSA.gov . The Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act includes a provision requiring GAO to study the use of publicly available safety recall information. This report addresses: (1) how consumers and industry stakeholders use such information and (2) how easy to use do consumers find the auto recall areas of NHTSA.gov, among other objectives. To understand consumers' use of auto recall information and to test website usability, GAO conducted 12 focus groups with 94 consumers who had a recall. Focus groups were held in six locations selected for population and geographic variation. GAO identified key website usability practices and requested an evaluation by website usability professionals. GAO reviewed statutes, regulations, and NHTSA documents, and interviewed industry stakeholders—including 10 manufacturers selected based on sales market share and other factors. Consumers, manufacturers, and auto dealers use publicly available auto recall information differently. For example, the 94 consumers in 12 focus groups that GAO conducted used this information to decide whether to repair their vehicles. These consumers overwhelmingly cited safety risk and convenience as the two most influential factors they considered. Most consumers reported a preference for receiving recall notification by at least one electronic means, such as by e-mail or text message, in addition to mail. However, only 7 of 94 consumers reported receiving electronic notifications, suggesting a gap between the industry's auto recall notification practices and consumers' preferences. (See fig.). In response to a mandate in law, in September 2016, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) issued a proposed rule that, if finalized, would require manufacturers to notify consumers about auto recalls by electronic means in addition to mail. Most consumers in GAO's focus group website usability tests found the auto recall areas of NHTSA's website—NHTSA.gov—easy to use; however, some consumers experienced difficulties when asked to complete auto recall related tasks. For example, when consumers attempted to search for recalls affecting their specific vehicles, some found the search results confusing, leading them to question the accuracy of the results. Similarly, some consumers were hampered in searching for recalls by their vehicles' year, make, and model because the website did not always display model options using plain language. GAO found that the auto recall areas of NHTSA.gov do not always reflect federal and industry key website usability practices, and that an independent evaluation conducted by website usability professionals at GAO's request identified similar issues. NHTSA is in the process of consolidating its websites and plans to conduct a website usability study of NHTSA.gov with consumers after the consolidation is complete. However, the agency has not determined a completion date for the consolidation effort—an essential step for organizations to effectively guide their information technology efforts. Without establishing a completion date and taking interim steps to improve the usability of NHTSA.gov, consumers will likely continue to experience difficulties, which may limit the effectiveness of the website's primary means of providing consumers with information about recalls affecting their vehicles. GAO recommends that NHTSA determine a completion date for its website consolidation effort and take interim steps to improve the usability of NHTSA.gov by addressing the website usability difficulties GAO identified.

Specifically, we identified deficiencies in the technical controls and agency-wide information security program that were intended to identify risk, protect systems from threats and vulnerabilities, detect cybersecurity events, respond to these events, and recover system operations. These deficiencies increased the risk that sensitive personally identifiable and health-related information could be disclosed or modified without authorization. We made 195 recommendations to CDC to strengthen its technical security controls and bolster its agency-wide information security program. Since the issuance of our June 2018 report, CDC has made significant progress in implementing the recommendations we made to resolve the technical security control deficiencies in the information systems we reviewed and to improve its information security program. The agency has implemented many of the recommendations for improving technical security controls for the systems we reviewed and has developed plans to implement recommendations for enhancing its information security program.\n\nSummary: Passage 2\nThe Navy's attack submarine fleet has suffered from persistent and costly maintenance delays, resulting in significant idle time and operating and support cost expenditures. Our analysis of Navy maintenance data shows that between fiscal year 2008 and the end of fiscal year 2018, attack submarines will have incurred 10,363 days of idle time and maintenance delays as a result of delays in getting into and out of the shipyards. The primary driver affecting attack submarines are delays in completing depot maintenance. We estimate that the Navy will incur approximately $266 million in operating and support costs in fiscal year 2018 constant dollars for idle submarines from fiscal year 2018 through fiscal year 2023, as well as additional depot maintenance delays. The Navy may have options to mitigate idle time and maintenance delays, such as shifting maintenance to private shipyards. However, the Navy has not completed a comprehensive business case analysis to inform maintenance workload allocation across public and private shipyards, which would help it better assess private shipyard capacity and incorporate a complete accounting of all costs, benefits, and risks.\n\nSummary: Passage 3\nThe passage is a transcript of a meeting between a project manager, Marty, and three team members, Sarah (marketing), Ron (user interface designer), and Nathan (industrial designer).

This statement discusses Coast Guard actions needed to (1) improve the quality of data used for program management and (2) improve the transparency of its data for reporting on mission performance and planning. This statement is based on relevant products GAO issued from June 2014 through December 2017 on Coast Guard strategic planning and management issues, as well as related recommendation follow-up conducted through February 2018. GAO reviewed applicable laws, regulations, policies and guidance. GAO also interviewed Coast Guard officials responsible for administering these programs and obtained information on how they used data to inform decisionmaking. GAO interviewed a range of stakeholders, including federal and industry officials. GAO's prior work recommended multiple actions to improve the Coast Guard's program management by improving the quality of data it uses to manage and report on its mission performance. Specifically, GAO recommended actions such as collecting more complete data and clarifying the data limitations to facilitate more effective program management. For example, in December 2017, GAO found that more information is needed to calculate vessel safety statistics that could enhance the Coast Guard's knowledge about accident, injury, and fatality trends involving commercial fishing vessels. Having more complete information could be useful to carrying out its marine safety mission, and GAO recommended, among other things, that the Coast Guard ensure that data collected during commercial fishing vessel incident investigations is accurately captured. In 2018, the Coast Guard reported taking initial steps to capture more accurate data. GAO's prior work also identified areas where the Coast Guard could improve the transparency of the data it uses for reporting on its mission performance as well its capital planning purposes. For example, in an October 2017 report on performance goals, GAO found the Coast Guard's Annual Performance Report (APR) has not been released publicly since 2011. Consequently, there has not been full visibility over performance across all of the Coast Guard's missions. Coast Guard officials stated that a decision by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) leadership to limit the number of performance goals shared publicly had deterred the Coast Guard from public release of its APR. GAO recommended that APRs be available on the Coast Guard's website; the Coast Guard plans to publicly release future APRs. In addition, previous GAO reports found that the Coast Guard's annual 5-year capital investment plan, which projects acquisition funding needs for the upcoming 5 years, did not consistently reflect current total cost estimates or the effects of tradeoffs made as part of the annual budget cycle.

NCA's plan to increase burial access for veterans includes establishing 18 new national cemeteries and awarding funds for new state and tribal government veterans' cemeteries. However, NCA has experienced challenges in acquiring suitable land for new national cemeteries, estimating costs, and using data to inform its Grants Program. As a result, the completion dates for some urban and rural initiative sites have slipped, and construction cost estimates have increased significantly. NCA's cost-estimating guidance does not fully incorporate the 12 steps identified in the GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide, which may lead to unreliable cost estimates. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs should ensure that the Under Secretary for Memorial Affairs updates NCA's cost-estimating procedures to fully incorporate the 12 steps.

The risk assessment tool does not account for natural hazards, such as earthquakes and hurricanes, which are a significant threat to the pipeline sector. The tool also does not capture the uncertainty of the number of critical facilities a pipeline system has identified, which can affect the vulnerability calculation. The TSA has not updated the risk assessment tool since 2014, and the data used to calculate threat may be outdated. The TSA has also not fully documented the data sources, underlying assumptions, and judgments that form the basis of the risk assessment. The TSA's Pipeline Security Branch has not considered incorporating additional factors that enhance security into their risk calculation, which would better align their efforts with Presidential Policy Directive 21 (PPD-21).

The Coast Guard has 11 statutory missions, managed through six mission programs, including marine safety, which involves conducting safety inspections and vessel accident investigations. The Coast Guard's performance assessment process includes identifying performance gaps and implementing corrective actions to address unmet performance goals. However, the Coast Guard faces challenges in collecting and using data to inform its performance goals, including incomplete data on commercial fishing vessel safety and unrealistic asset performance data. The Coast Guard has begun acquiring new vessels, but concerns surround the affordability of this effort. To address these challenges, the Coast Guard should improve the completeness of mission data, use more realistic asset performance data, and improve performance goal data. The Coast Guard should also improve transparency of data on mission performance and capital planning transparency. The Coast Guard has made some progress in addressing these challenges, but further action is needed to ensure effective program management. The Coast Guard's acquisition portfolio is a concern, with multiple new acquisitions without long-term planning to guide affordability. The Coast Guard has begun developing a 20-year Long-term Major Acquisition Plan, but it is unclear when the plan will be completed. The Coast Guard's performance goals are not always reliable, and the agency should assess the extent to which documentation on performance data reliability contains appropriate information on known data reliability limitations. The Coast Guard's Annual Performance Report (APR) has not been released publicly since 2011, and the agency should make future APRs available on its public website. The Coast Guard's capital investment plan does not consistently reflect current total cost estimates or the effects of tradeoffs made during the annual budget cycle.

This statement discusses Coast Guard actions needed to (1) improve the quality of data used for program management and (2) improve the transparency of its data for reporting on mission performance and planning. This statement is based on relevant products GAO issued from June 2014 through December 2017 on Coast Guard strategic planning and management issues, as well as related recommendation follow-up conducted through February 2018. GAO reviewed applicable laws, regulations, policies and guidance. GAO also interviewed Coast Guard officials responsible for administering these programs and obtained information on how they used data to inform decisionmaking. GAO interviewed a range of stakeholders, including federal and industry officials. GAO's prior work recommended multiple actions to improve the Coast Guard's program management by improving the quality of data it uses to manage and report on its mission performance. Specifically, GAO recommended actions such as collecting more complete data and clarifying the data limitations to facilitate more effective program management. For example, in December 2017, GAO found that more information is needed to calculate vessel safety statistics that could enhance the Coast Guard's knowledge about accident, injury, and fatality trends involving commercial fishing vessels. Having more complete information could be useful to carrying out its marine safety mission, and GAO recommended, among other things, that the Coast Guard ensure that data collected during commercial fishing vessel incident investigations is accurately captured. In 2018, the Coast Guard reported taking initial steps to capture more accurate data. GAO's prior work also identified areas where the Coast Guard could improve the transparency of the data it uses for reporting on its mission performance as well its capital planning purposes. For example, in an October 2017 report on performance goals, GAO found the Coast Guard's Annual Performance Report (APR) has not been released publicly since 2011. Consequently, there has not been full visibility over performance across all of the Coast Guard's missions. Coast Guard officials stated that a decision by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) leadership to limit the number of performance goals shared publicly had deterred the Coast Guard from public release of its APR. GAO recommended that APRs be available on the Coast Guard's website; the Coast Guard plans to publicly release future APRs. In addition, previous GAO reports found that the Coast Guard's annual 5-year capital investment plan, which projects acquisition funding needs for the upcoming 5 years, did not consistently reflect current total cost estimates or the effects of tradeoffs made as part of the annual budget cycle. GAO made recommendations to help the Coast Guard plan for future acquisitions and the difficult trade off decisions it will face given funding constraints. The Coast Guard agreed, but it is unclear when it will complete the 20-year plan.

{"pred": " Passage 1\nThe Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is responsible for overseeing the security of the nation's pipeline systems, which transport hazardous liquids and natural gas. The TSA's Pipeline Security Branch has a risk assessment tool to identify the top 100 critical pipeline systems, but it has not been updated since 2014, and its methodology is not transparent. The risk assessment tool does not account for natural hazards, cybersecurity threats, or cross-sector interdependencies, which are critical factors in assessing pipeline security risks. The TSA's performance measures for its pipeline security program are also weak, lacking clarity, measurable targets, and baseline and trend data. The TSA's databases for tracking CSR and CFSR recommendations are also unreliable, with missing data, inconsistent data entry formats, and data entry errors. The TSA's pipeline security program is hindered by a lack of clear objectives, a poorly defined risk assessment methodology, and inadequate performance measures. To address these weaknesses, the TSA Administrator should direct the Security Policy and Industry Engagement's Surface Division to implement a documented process for reviewing and revising its Pipeline Security Guidelines at regular defined intervals. The TSA should also clarify its Pipeline Security Guidelines by defining key terms within its criteria for determining critical facilities. Additionally, the TSA should develop a strategic workforce plan for its Security Policy and Industry Engagement's Surface Division, which includes determining the number of personnel necessary to meet the goals set for the Pipeline Security Branch, as well as the knowledge, skills, and abilities, including cybersecurity, that are needed to effectively conduct CSRs and CFSRs. The TSA should also update the Pipeline Relative Risk Ranking Tool to include up-to-date data to ensure it reflects industry conditions, including throughput and threat data. Furthermore, the TSA should fully document the data sources, underlying assumptions, and judgments that form the basis of the Pipeline Relative Risk Ranking Tool, including sources of uncertainty and any implications for interpreting the results from the assessment. The TSA should also identify or develop other data sources relevant to threat, vulnerability, and consequence consistent with the NIPP and DHS critical infrastructure risk mitigation priorities and incorporate that data into the Pipeline Relative Risk Ranking Tool to assess relative risk of critical pipeline systems. Finally, the TSA should take steps to coordinate an independent, external peer review of its Pipeline Relative Risk Ranking Tool, after the Pipeline Security Branch completes enhancements to its risk assessment approach. The TSA should also ensure that the Security Policy and Industry Engagement's Surface Division has a suite of performance measures which exhibit key attributes of successful performance measures, including measurable targets, clarity, baseline, and trend data", "answers": ["More than 2.7 million miles of pipeline transport and distribute oil, natural gas, and other hazardous products throughout the United States. Interstate pipelines run through remote areas and highly populated urban areas, and are vulnerable to accidents, operating errors, and malicious physical and cyber-based attack or intrusion. The energy sector accounted for 35 percent of the 796 critical infrastructure cyber incidents reported to DHS from 2013 to 2015. Several federal and private entities have roles in pipeline security. TSA is primarily responsible for the oversight of pipeline physical security and cybersecurity. GAO was asked to review TSA's efforts to assess and enhance pipeline security and cybersecurity. This report examines, among other objectives: (1) the guidance pipeline operators reported using to address security risks and the extent that TSA ensures its guidelines reflect the current threat environment; (2) the extent that TSA has assessed pipeline systems' security risks; and (3) the extent TSA has assessed its effectiveness in reducing pipeline security risks. GAO analyzed TSA documents, such as its Pipeline Security Guidelines ; evaluated TSA pipeline risk assessment efforts; and interviewed TSA officials, 10 U.S. pipeline operators—selected based on volume, geography, and material transported—and representatives from five industry associations. Pipeline operators reported using a range of guidelines and standards to address physical and cybersecurity risks, including the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) Pipeline Security Guidelines , initially issued in 2011. TSA issued revised guidelines in March 2018 to reflect changes in the threat environment and incorporate most of the principles and practices from the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity . However, TSA's revisions do not include all elements of the current framework and TSA does not have a documented process for reviewing and revising its guidelines on a regular basis. Without such a documented process, TSA cannot ensure that its guidelines reflect the latest known standards and best practices for physical security and cybersecurity, or address the dynamic security threat environment that pipelines face. Further, GAO found that the guidelines lack clear definitions to ensure that pipeline operators identify their critical facilities. GAO's analysis showed that operators of at least 34 of the nation's top 100 critical pipeline systems (determined by volume of product transported) deemed highest risk had identified no critical facilities. This may be due, in part, to the guidelines not clearly defining the criteria to determine facilities' criticality. To assess pipeline security risks, TSA conducts pipeline security reviews—Corporate Security Reviews and Critical Facility Security Reviews—to assess pipeline systems' vulnerabilities. However, GAO found that the number of TSA security reviews has varied considerably over the last several years, as shown in the table on the following page. TSA officials stated that staffing limitations have prevented TSA from conducting more reviews. Staffing levels for TSA's Pipeline Security Branch have varied significantly since fiscal year 2010 with the number of staff ranging from 14 full-time equivalents in fiscal years 2012 and 2013 to 1 in 2014. Further, TSA does not have a strategic workforce plan to help ensure it identifies the skills and competencies—such as the required level of cybersecurity expertise—necessary to carry out its pipeline security responsibilities. By establishing a strategic workforce plan, TSA can help ensure that it has identified the necessary skills, competencies, and staffing. GAO also identified factors that likely limit the usefulness of TSA's risk assessment methodology for prioritizing pipeline system reviews. Specifically, TSA has not updated its risk assessment methodology since 2014 to reflect current threats to the pipeline industry. Further, its sources of data and underlying assumptions and judgments regarding certain threat and vulnerability inputs are not fully documented. In addition, the risk assessment has not been peer reviewed since its inception in 2007. Taking steps to strengthen its risk assessment, and initiating an independent, external peer review would provide greater assurance that TSA ranks relative risk among pipeline systems using comprehensive and accurate data and methods. TSA has established performance measures to monitor pipeline security review recommendations, analyze their results, and assess effectiveness in reducing risks. However, these measures do not possess key attributes—such as clarity, and having measurable targets—that GAO has found are key to successful performance measures. By taking steps to ensure that its pipeline security program performance measures exhibit these key attributes, TSA could better assess its effectiveness at reducing pipeline systems' security risks. Pipeline Security Branch officials also reported conducting security reviews as the primary means for assessing the effectiveness of TSA's efforts to reduce pipeline security risks. However, TSA has not tracked the status of Corporate Security Review recommendations for the past 5 years. Until TSA monitors and records the status of these reviews' recommendations, it will be hindered in its efforts to determine whether its recommendations are leading to significant reduction in risk. GAO makes 10 recommendations to TSA to improve its pipeline security program management (many are listed on the next page), and DHS concurred. GAO recommends, among other things, that the TSA Administrator take the following actions: implement a documented process for reviewing, and if deemed necessary, for revising TSA's Pipeline Security Guidelines at defined intervals; clarify TSA's Pipeline Security Guidelines by defining key terms within its criteria for determining critical facilities; develop a strategic workforce plan for TSA's Security Policy and Industry Engagement‘s Surface Division; update TSA's pipeline risk assessment methodology to include current data to ensure it reflects industry conditions and threats; fully document the data sources, underlying assumptions and judgments that form the basis of TSA's pipeline risk assessment methodology; take steps to coordinate an independent, external peer review of TSA's pipeline risk assessment methodology; ensure the Security Policy and Industry Engagement‘s Surface Division has a suite of performance measures which exhibit key attributes of successful performance measures; and enter information on Corporate Security Review recommendations and monitor and record their status."], "length": 26167}

The investigation found that the medical centers lacked documentation for almost half of the reviews conducted, and in some cases, the required reviews were not conducted at all. The GAO identified two main factors contributing to these shortcomings: inadequate VHA policy and oversight. The investigation also found that providers were not reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) and state licensing boards as required, which facilitated the movement of providers who provided substandard care to other facilities. The GAO recommended that VHA require documentation of all reviews, establish a timeliness requirement for initiating reviews, and strengthen its oversight to ensure that reviews are conducted and reported in a timely manner. VA concurred with these recommendations and plans to revise existing policy and update the standardized audit tool to include more comprehensive oversight. The investigation highlighted the need for improved oversight and accountability in the VA medical centers to ensure that providers who provide substandard care are held accountable. The GAO also found that providers who were not reported to the NPDB or state licensing boards were able to obtain privileges at other VA medical centers or hospitals outside of the VA's healthcare system. This lack of oversight and accountability poses a significant risk to the quality of care provided to veterans.

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (VAMC) officials are responsible for reviewing the clinical care delivered by their privileged providers—physicians and dentists who are approved to independently perform specific services—after concerns are raised. The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care. For example, GAO found that after one VAMC failed to report to the NPDB or SLBs a provider who resigned to avoid an adverse privileging action, a non-VA hospital in the same city took an adverse privileging action against that same provider for the same reason 2 years later."], "length": 28428}

USAID is primarily responsible for administering ESF assistance to the West Bank and Gaza. Appropriations acts for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 included provisions for GAO to review the treatment, handling, and uses of funds provided through the ESF for assistance to the West Bank and Gaza. This report examines (1) the status of ESF assistance and projects provided to the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016, including project assistance and payments to PA creditors, and (2) the extent to which USAID conducted required vetting of PA creditors to ensure that this assistance would not support entities or individuals associated with terrorism and assessed PA ministries' capacity to use ESF assistance as intended. GAO reviewed relevant laws and regulations and USAID financial data, policies, procedures, and documents. GAO also interviewed USAID and State Department officials. As of March 2018, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) had allocated about $545 million of funding appropriated to the Economic Support Fund (ESF) for assistance in the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016. USAID obligated about $544 million (over 99 percent) and expended about $351 million (over 64 percent) of the total allocations. Project assistance accounted for approximately $399 million of the obligated funds, while payments to Palestinian Authority (PA) creditors accounted for $145 million (see figure). USAID's obligations for project assistance in the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 supported three development objectives—Economic Growth and Infrastructure ($239 million), Investing in the Next Generation ($107 million), and Governance and Civic Engagement (about $25 million). In fiscal years 2015 and 2016, USAID made payments directly to PA creditors—two Israeli fuel companies, to cover debts for petroleum purchases, and a local Palestinian bank, to pay off a line of credit used for PA medical referrals to six hospitals in the East Jerusalem Hospital network. USAID vetted PA creditors to ensure that the program assistance would not provide support to entities or individuals associated with terrorism and also conducted external assessments and financial audits of PA ministries of Health and Finance and Planning. USAID documentation showed that, as required, officials checked the vetting status of each PA creditor within 12 months before USAID signed its debt relief grant agreements with the PA. In addition, although USAID determined that it was not legally required to assess the PA Ministry of Health's medical referral services and the Ministry of Finance and Planning's petroleum procurement system, the agency commissioned external assessments of both ministries. These assessments found some weaknesses in both ministries' systems; however, USAID mission officials stated that these weaknesses did not affect USAID debt relief payments to the PA creditors. Nevertheless, USAID took additional steps to mitigate the identified weaknesses. For example, a USAID contractor worked with the Ministry of Health to update, revise, and approve guidelines for medical referrals. In addition, USAID commissioned financial audits of the debt relief grant agreements between USAID and the PA for direct payments to PA creditors in fiscal year 2015 and 2016.

The programs provide free, reduced-price, and full-price meals to students in participating schools. The passage notes that the programs were last reauthorized by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (HHFKA) and that some of the authorities created or extended by the HHFKA expired in 2015. However, the programs have continued with funding provided by annual appropriations acts. The passage also discusses the nutrition standards for school meals, which were updated following the enactment of the HHFKA. The standards require schools to provide more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains in school lunches and breakfasts, and to limit calories, sodium, and fat in meals. The passage notes that some schools have experienced challenges implementing the changes, including difficulty obtaining whole grain and low-sodium products, issues with student acceptance of foods, reduced participation, increased costs, and increased food waste. The passage also discusses the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP), which provides funding for fruit and vegetable snacks in participating elementary schools. The passage notes that some stakeholders have advocated for the inclusion of frozen, dried, canned, and other types of fruits and vegetables in the program, while others have advocated for continuing to maintain only fresh products. The passage also discusses the Buy American requirements, which require schools to purchase domestic commodities or products to the maximum extent practicable.

The team members, including the Project Manager, Industrial Designer, User Interface, and Marketing, assessed the design using a seven-point scale. They evaluated various criteria, including the design's attractiveness, usability, and innovation. The team agreed that the design was attractive and innovative, but had some issues with usability, such as being difficult for left-handed people to use. The team decided to keep the design's features, including voice recognition and a spinning wheel, but to remove the locator feature, which was considered a gimmick. The team also discussed the budget and production costs, and decided to remove the sample sensor and speaker, which were expensive, and to use a simpler beeping device instead. The team agreed that the design was within budget and that they had done a good job of working together and using the whiteboard and digital pens effectively. They also discussed the process and noted that they had made some random decisions at the end, which could have been prevented if they had known the costs of the different components at the start. Overall, the team was satisfied with the design and the process, and they looked forward to the next meeting. The Project Manager agreed with Marketing when assessing the criteria of matching the operating behaviour of the user because Marketing pointed out that the design was not very intuitive, but it was still a good technology once people got used to it. The Project Manager agreed that the design was not very intuitive, but it was still a good technology, and therefore gave it a score of six. This was because the design was still functional, but it required some thought and effort to use it correctly. The Project Manager's agreement with Marketing was based on the fact that the design was not very intuitive, but it was still a good technology, and therefore deserved a score of six. This was a key point in the team's discussion, as it highlighted the importance of usability and user experience in the design of the remote control. The team's discussion and assessment of the design were key points in the passage, as they demonstrated the team's ability to work together and evaluate the design critically. The passage also highlighted the importance of usability and user experience in the design of the remote control, and the need for designers to consider the needs and preferences of the user when creating a product.

{"pred": " Passage 3\nThe confirmation process in the US Senate serves several purposes, including examining the qualifications of nominees and influencing policy through the confirmation process. The Senate has a regularized process for handling nominations, which allows for quick action on thousands of government positions. The process involves committees gathering and reviewing information about nominees, holding hearings, and reporting on nominations to the Senate. The Senate can approve or reject nominations, and a majority of Senators present and voting is required to approve a nomination. The confirmation process has been subject to changes since 2011, including the reinterpretation of Senate Rule XXII to reduce the maximum time allowed for consideration of most nominations after cloture is invoked. The Senate has also reinterpreted Senate Rule XXII to reduce the maximum time allowed for consideration of most nominations after cloture is invoked, from 30 hours to 2 hours. This change is expected to affect the time between a cloture vote and a confirmation vote, and may also affect how often the Senate relies on the cloture process to approve nominations. The confirmation process is an important part of the US Senate's role in advising and consenting on presidential nominations. Key evidence presented in the passage includes the Senate's rules and precedents, as well as the changes made to the confirmation process since 2011.

The passage also provides evidence to support these claims, and highlights the changes that have been made to the confirmation process since 2011. The reinterpretation of Senate Rule XX", "answers": ["Article II, Section 2, of the Constitution provides that the President shall appoint officers of the United States \"by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate.\" This report describes the process by which the Senate provides advice and consent on presidential nominations, including receipt and referral of nominations, committee practices, and floor procedure. Committees play the central role in the process through investigations and hearings. Senate Rule XXXI provides that nominations shall be referred to appropriate committees \"unless otherwise ordered.\" Most nominations are referred, although a Senate standing order provides that some \"privileged\" nominations to specified positions will not be referred unless requested by a Senator. The Senate rule concerning committee jurisdictions (Rule XXV) broadly defines issue areas for committees, and the same jurisdictional statements generally apply to nominations as well as legislation. A committee often gathers information about a nominee either before or instead of a formal hearing. A committee considering a nomination has four options. It can report the nomination to the Senate favorably, unfavorably, or without recommendation, or it can choose to take no action. It is more common for a committee to take no action on a nomination than to reject a nominee outright. The Senate handles executive business, which includes both nominations and treaties, separately from its legislative business. All nominations reported from committee are listed on the Executive Calendar, a separate document from the Calendar of Business, which lists pending bills and resolutions. Generally speaking, the majority leader schedules floor consideration of nominations on the Calendar. Nominations are considered in \"executive session,\" a parliamentary form of the Senate in session that has its own journal and, to some extent, its own rules of procedure. The Senate can call up a nomination expeditiously, because a motion to enter executive session to consider a specific nomination on the Calendar is not debatable. This motion requires a majority of Senators present and voting, a quorum being present, for approval. After a nomination has been called up, the question before the Senate is \"will the Senate advise and consent to this nomination?\" A majority of Senators voting is required to approve a nomination. However, Senate rules place no limit on how long a nomination may be debated, and ending consideration could require invoking cloture. On April 6, 2017, the Senate reinterpreted Rule XXII in order to allow cloture to be invoked on nominations to the Supreme Court by a majority of Senators voting. This expanded the results of similar actions taken by the Senate in November 2013, which changed the cloture vote requirement to a majority for nominations other than to the Supreme Court. After the 2013 decision, the number of nominations subjected to a cloture process increased. On April 3, 2019, the Senate reinterpreted Rule XXII again. The Senate reduced, from 30 hours to 2 hours, the maximum time nominations can be considered after cloture has been invoked. This change applied to all executive branch nominations except to high-level positions such as heads of departments, and it applied to all judicial nominations except to the Supreme Court and the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The full impact of this change is difficult to assess at this time, but it is likely to shorten the time between a cloture vote and a vote on the nomination. If Senators respond as they did to the last reinterpretation of the cloture rule, it might also increase the number of nominations subjected to a cloture process. Nominations that are pending when the Senate adjourns sine die at the end of a session or recesses for more than 30 days are returned to the President unless the Senate, by unanimous consent, waives the rule requiring their return (Senate Rule XXXI, clause 6). If a nomination is returned, and the President still desires Senate consideration, he must submit a new nomination."], "length": 25687}
{"pred": " Passage 3\nThe Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) is a federal program that provides free meals to children in low-income areas during the summer months. The program has seen an increase in the number of meals served, from 113 million in 2007 to 149 million in 2016. However, the program faces several challenges, including limited meal site availability, particularly in rural areas, and inconsistent state-level data on children's participation. The program's estimates of children's participation are unreliable due to variations in the number of operating days of meal sites and the months with the greatest number of meals served. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) has taken steps to address these challenges, including providing flexibilities in meal delivery and streamlining administrative requirements for sponsors participating in multiple child nutrition programs. However, FNS has not clearly communicated the circumstances under which it grants flexibility with respect to the requirement that children consume summer meals on-site in areas with violence or crime. The agency has also not evaluated the use of these flexibilities and their impact on program administration. To address these challenges, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommends that FNS improve its estimate of children's participation in the SFSP, communicate the circumstances for granting flexibility, evaluate and report on the use of waivers and demonstration projects, and disseminate information on existing flexibilities available to state agencies to streamline administrative requirements. Overall, the SFSP plays a critical role in providing nutritious meals to children in low-income areas during the summer months, but faces several challenges that need to be addressed to ensure the program's success. The GAO's recommendations aim to improve the program's effectiveness and ensure that children have access to nutritious meals during the summer. The SFSP has provided 149 million meals to children in fiscal year 2016, and FNS has taken steps to address challenges, but more work is needed to ensure the program's success. The GAO's recommendations focus on improving the program's estimates, communication, and evaluation to ensure that children have access to nutritious meals during the summer. The SFSP is a critical program that provides meals to children in low-income areas during the summer, and addressing its challenges is essential to ensuring the program's success.

In the last decade, federal expenditures for SFSP have increased as the program has expanded, according to USDA data. GAO was asked to review the SFSP. This report examines (1) what is known about SFSP participation, (2) other programs that help feed low-income children over the summer, and (3) challenges, if any, in providing summer meals to children and the extent to which USDA provides assistance to address these challenges. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed USDA's SFSP data for fiscal years 2007 through 2016; surveyed state agencies responsible for administering the SFSP in 50 states and the District of Columbia; visited a nongeneralizable group of 3 states and 30 meal sites, selected based on Census data on child poverty rates and urban and rural locations; analyzed meal site data from the 3 states; and interviewed USDA, state and national organization officials, and SFSP providers, including sponsors and site operators. Nationwide, the total number of meals served to children in low-income areas through the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) increased from 113 to 149 million (about 32 percent) from fiscal year 2007 through 2016. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) directs states to use the number of meals served, along with other data, to estimate the number of children participating in the SFSP. However, participation estimates have been calculated inconsistently from state to state and year to year. In 2017, USDA took steps to improve the consistency of participation estimates, noting they are critical for informing program implementation and strategic planning. However, GAO determined that the method USDA directs states to use will continue to provide unreliable estimates of participation, hindering USDA's ability to use them for these purposes. Other federal and nonfederal programs help feed low-income children over the summer to some extent, according to states GAO surveyed and SFSP providers and others GAO interviewed. For example, in July 2016, USDA data indicate about 26 million meals were served through a separate federal program that allows school meal providers to serve summer meals. Some children also received summer meals through nonfederal programs operated by faith-based organizations and foodbanks, though GAO's state survey and interviews with providers and national organizations indicate the reach of such efforts is limited. States and SFSP providers reported challenges with meal sites, participation, and program administration; USDA has taken steps to address these areas. Specifically, in GAO's survey, a majority of states reported challenges with availability and awareness of meal sites, as well as limited program participation and administrative capacity. National, state, and local officials have taken steps to address these issues, such as increasing outreach and offering activities to attract participation. In addition, 17 states in GAO's survey and providers in the states GAO visited reported a challenge with ensuring meal sites are in safe locations. To address this safety issue, USDA has granted some states and sponsors flexibility from the requirement that children consume meals on-site. However, USDA has not broadly communicated the circumstances it considers when granting this flexibility. Further, some states and sponsors that have requested this flexibility reported difficulty obtaining data to show these circumstances exist, hampering their ability to ensure safe meal delivery. GAO is making four recommendations, including that USDA improve estimates of children's participation in SFSP and communicate the circumstances it considers when granting flexibilities to ensure safe meal delivery.

{"pred": " \nPassage 3 discusses the oversight of clinical care reviews at five VA medical centers. The review found that the medical centers lacked documentation for almost half of the reviews conducted, and in some cases, the required reviews were not conducted at all. The review also found that the VA medical centers did not always conduct reviews in a timely manner, with some reviews taking multiple years to initiate. The main factors contributing to these shortcomings were inadequate VHA policy and oversight. The review recommended that VHA require documentation of all reviews, establish a timeliness requirement, and strengthen its oversight to ensure that reviews are conducted and documented in a timely manner. The review also found that the VA medical centers failed to report providers to the NPDB and state licensing boards as required, which facilitated providers who provide substandard care at one facility obtaining privileges at another VA medical center or at hospitals outside of VA's health care system. The review recommended that VHA require its networks to establish a process for overseeing VA medical centers to ensure they are reporting to the NPDB and to state licensing boards and to ensure that this reporting is timely. VA concurred with these recommendations and plans to revise existing policy and update the standardized audit tool used by the networks to include more comprehensive oversight of VA medical centers' reviews of providers' clinical care after concerns have been raised. The review found several cases of providers who were not reported to the NPDB or state licensing boards by the five VA medical centers, and who were able to obtain privileges at other facilities.

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (VAMC) officials are responsible for reviewing the clinical care delivered by their privileged providers—physicians and dentists who are approved to independently perform specific services—after concerns are raised. The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care. For example, GAO found that after one VAMC failed to report to the NPDB or SLBs a provider who resigned to avoid an adverse privileging action, a non-VA hospital in the same city took an adverse privileging action against that same provider for the same reason 2 years later."], "length": 27148}

As of September 2019, only four new traditional national cemeteries and two rural initiative cemeteries had been opened, and the completion dates for the remaining sites had slipped multiple times. NCA's cost-estimating guidance does not fully incorporate the 12 steps identified in the GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide, which could lead to unreliable cost estimates. The Grants Program, which provides funding for state and tribal government veterans' cemeteries, relies on states and tribal governments to apply for funding, and NCA's current methodology for identifying unserved veteran populations may not be the most effective.

The House Appropriations Committee has expressed concerns that there are geographic pockets where veterans remain unserved by burial options. House Report 115-188 accompanying a bill for the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018, includes a provision for GAO to examine veterans' access to burial options. This report (1) describes VA's plan for increasing reasonable access to burial options for veterans and (2) assesses VA's progress in implementing its plan and any challenges experienced. GAO reviewed applicable VA and NCA documents, compared NCA's cost-estimating practices with GAO's cost-estimating 12 steps, and met with cognizant officials regarding NCA's efforts to provide reasonable access to burial options. Within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) has a plan to establish 18 new national cemeteries to increase reasonable access to burial options for veterans. NCA defines reasonable access as a national or state veterans' cemetery being located within 75 miles of veterans' homes. Key parts of NCA's plan include establishing 13 urban and rural initiative national cemeteries and awarding grant funds to state applicants for establishing new state veterans' cemeteries. NCA has made limited progress in implementing its plan to increase burial access and is years behind its original schedule for opening new cemeteries. For example, NCA has opened only two of its planned urban and rural initiative sites and is behind its original schedule for the other 11 (see fig. below). The primary factor delaying NCA's completion of these cemeteries has been challenges in acquiring suitable land. NCA has also been challenged in producing accurate estimates of construction costs for most of its rural initiative sites. Cost estimates have increased more than 200 percent (from about $7 million to $24 million) for these sites, and NCA's guidance for developing cost estimates for the cemeteries does not fully incorporate the 12 steps identified in cost-estimating leading practices—such as conducting a risk and uncertainty analysis or a sensitivity analysis. As a result, NCA is not well positioned to provide reliable and valid cost estimates to better inform decisions to enhance veterans' cemetery access.

There is no single definition of the terms \"runaway youth\" or \"homeless youth.\" However, both groups of youth share the risk of not having adequate shelter and other provisions, and may engage in harmful behaviors while away from a permanent home. Youth most often cite family conflict as the major reason for their homelessness or episodes of running away. A youth's sexual orientation, sexual activity, school problems, and substance abuse are associated with family discord. The precise number of homeless and runaway youth is unknown due to their residential mobility and overlap among the populations. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is supporting data collection efforts, known as Voices of Youth Count, to better determine the number of homeless youth. The 2017 study found that approximately 700,000 youth ages 13 to 17 and 3.5 million young adults ages 18 to 25 experienced homelessness within a 12-month period because they were sleeping in places not meant for habitation, in shelters, or with others while lacking alternative living arrangements. From the early 20th century through the 1960s, the needs of runaway and homeless youth were handled locally through the child welfare agency, juvenile justice courts, or both. The 1970s marked a shift toward federal oversight of programs that help youth who had run afoul of the law, including those who committed status offenses (i.e., a noncriminal act that is considered a violation of the law because of the youth's age). The Runaway Youth Act of 1974 was enacted as Title III of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (P.L. 93-415) to assist runaways through services specifically for this population. The act was amended over time to include homeless youth. It authorizes funding for services carried out under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Program (RHYP), which is administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The program was most recently authorized through FY2020 by the Juvenile Justice Reform Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-385). This law did not make other changes to the RHYP statute. Funding is discretionary, meaning provided through the appropriations process. FY2019 appropriations are $127.4 million. The RHYP program is made up of three components: the Basic Center Program (BCP), Transitional Living Program (TLP), and Street Outreach Program (SOP). The BCP provides temporary shelter, counseling, and after care services to runaway and homeless youth under age 18 and their families. In FY2017, the program served 23,288 youth, and in FY2018 it funded 280 BCP shelters (most recent figures available). The TLP is targeted to older youth ages 16 through 22 (and sometimes an older age). In FY2017, the TLP program served 3,517 youth, and in FY2018 it funded 299 grantees (most recent figures available). Youth who use the TLP receive longer-term housing with supportive services. The SOP provides education, treatment, counseling, and referrals for runaway, homeless, and street youth who have been subjected to, or are at risk of being subjected to, sexual abuse, sex exploitation, and trafficking. In FY2017, the SOP grantees made contact with 24,366 youth. The RHYP is a part of larger federal efforts to end youth homelessness through the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH). The USICH is a coordinating body made up of multiple federal agencies committed to addressing homelessness. The USICH's Opening Doors plan to end homelessness includes strategies for ending youth homelessness by 2020, including through collecting better data and supporting evidence-based practices to improve youth outcomes.

The administrative burden refers to the bureaucratic process of asking parents to provide documents to prove their eligibility for the childcare offer, which can be difficult for parents with complex issues and backgrounds. The communication challenges refer to the issue of parents outside of the pilot areas asking why they cannot access the offer, while parents within the pilot areas are confused about why they do not qualify for the offer. The Minister for Children and Social Care, Huw Irranca-Davies, emphasized that these challenges are being addressed through the phased roll-out of the pilot, which will allow for the learning of lessons and the identification of areas for improvement. He also highlighted the importance of communication with parents and providers to ensure that they understand the offer and how to access it. The Minister expressed confidence that the childcare offer will be rolled out successfully by 2020, citing the £60 million capital fund and the 10-year workforce development plan as key factors in achieving this goal. However, he acknowledged that there may be capacity issues in some areas, particularly in the more expensive areas such as Cardiff and Newport, where the £4.50 per hour rate may not be sufficient. The Minister emphasized the need for a collaborative effort to address these challenges and to ensure that the childcare offer is accessible to all working families. \n\nThe Minister also discussed the issue of grandparents providing childcare, stating that the childcare offer is not intended to provide childcare for grandparents, but rather for registered and licensed providers. He emphasized that the focus of the scheme is on quality, socialization, and education, rather than simply child-minding. The Minister acknowledged that there may be some grandparents who are registered and licensed providers, but stated that this is not the primary focus of the scheme. \n\nThe Minister also addressed the issue of the £4.50 per hour rate, stating that it has been welcomed by the sector and is suitable for the foreseeable future. However, he acknowledged that there may be concerns about the national living wage implications and the need for a review of the rate in the future. The Minister emphasized the importance of affordability and the need for a collaborative effort to address the challenges of the childcare offer. \n\nOverall, the Minister emphasized the importance of a phased roll-out of the pilot, communication with parents and providers, and a collaborative effort to address the challenges of the childcare offer.

{"pred": " \nThe Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) is a US government-owned oil reserve that was established in response to the 1973-1974 Arab oil embargo. The SPR's primary purpose is to reduce the impact of disruptions in oil supplies and to meet the country's International Energy Agency (IEA) obligations. However, the SPR's size and configuration have not been re-examined since 2005, and the agency has not conducted a comprehensive analysis of the costs and benefits of holding different volumes of reserves. The SPR currently holds 695 million barrels of oil, but the agency has not identified the optimal size for the reserve, and the SPR's modernization plans are based on outdated information. The SPR's design capacity is 713.5 million barrels, but the agency has not considered the implications of projected fluctuations in US net imports or the role of private reserves in responding to supply disruptions. The SPR's configuration is primarily to respond to global oil supply disruptions, but it is limited in its ability to respond to domestic disruptions due to its composition of crude oil. The agency has not identified whether additional regional product reserves should be part of the SPR, and it has not completed studies on the costs and benefits of regional petroleum product reserves for all vulnerable US regions. The SPR's modernization plans are complicated by ongoing uncertainty regarding the SPR's long-term size and configuration, and the agency has not examined a full range of options for handling potentially excess SPR assets. The GAO recommends that the Secretary of Energy conduct an additional analysis of the SPR's size and configuration, consider private sector response, oil market projections, and costs and benefits of a wide range of different SPR sizes, and conduct or complete studies on the costs and benefits of regional petroleum product reserves. The GAO also recommends that the Secretary of Energy consider a full range of options for handling potentially excess assets and request congressional authority for the disposition of these assets if needed. The GAO's report highlights the need for the SPR to be re-examined and modernized to meet the country's evolving energy security needs and IEA obligations. The report also emphasizes the importance of considering private sector response, oil market projections, and costs and benefits of a wide range of different SPR sizes in determining the optimal size for the reserve. The GAO's recommendations aim to ensure that the SPR is effective at meeting US energy security needs and IEA obligations while being managed and maintained in an efficient manner. The report concludes that the SPR's current configuration and size are not optimal, and that the agency should take steps", "answers": ["More than 4 decades ago, Congress authorized the creation of the SPR to reduce the impact of disruptions in supplies of petroleum products. DOE manages the SPR. As a member of the International Energy Agency, the United States is obligated to maintain reserves equivalent to at least 90 days of the previous year's net imports (imports minus exports). The SPR's storage and related infrastructure is aging, and DOE has plans to modernize these facilities. Since 2015, Congress has mandated crude oil sales. As of March 2018, the SPR held about 665 million barrels of crude oil. GAO was asked to examine the SPR's ability to meet U.S. energy security needs. This report examines, among other things, the extent to which (1) DOE has identified the optimal size of the SPR, and (2) DOE's plans for modernizing the SPR take into account the effects of congressionally mandated crude oil sales. GAO reviewed DOE's plans and studies, and interviewed agency officials and nine experts selected based on prior work, referrals, and a literature review. The Department of Energy (DOE) has not identified the optimal size of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). In 2016, DOE completed a long-term strategic review of the SPR after its last comprehensive examination conducted in 2005. The 2016 review examined the benefits of several SPR sizes, but it did not identify an optimal size and its review was limited in several ways. In particular, DOE did not fully consider recent and expected future changes in market conditions, such as the implications of falling net imports, or the role that increased levels of private reserves (reserves held by private companies for their own purposes) may play in responding to supply disruptions. These changes have contributed to SPR and private reserves reaching historically high levels on a net imports basis (see figure). These changes are expected to continue to evolve—according to government projections, the United States will become a net exporter in the late 2020s before again becoming a net importer between 2040 and 2050. GAO has found that agencies should reexamine their programs if conditions change. Without addressing the limitations of its 2016 review and periodically performing reexaminations in the future, DOE cannot be assured that the SPR will be sized appropriately into the future. DOE has taken steps to take into account congressionally mandated sales of SPR crude oil in its $1.4 billion modernization plans for SPR's infrastructure and facilities. The SPR is projected to hold 405 million barrels of oil by the end of fiscal year 2027. However, DOE's current plans are based on information analyzed prior to recently mandated sales. According to DOE officials, the agency began a study in March 2018 to assess the effects of these sales on the SPR's modernization. However, this study is not examining all options for handling any excess SPR assets that may be created by currently mandated sales or any additional sales that may be mandated in the future, inconsistent with an agency order on real property asset management that calls for identifying excess assets. For example, DOE does not plan to examine the potential to lease unused SPR storage capacity to the private sector because DOE is not currently authorized to enter into such leases, according to agency officials. If authorized, leasing capacity could generate revenues that could help offset the costs of modernization. By not examining a full range of options, DOE risks missing beneficial ways to modernize the SPR while saving taxpayer resources. GAO is making four recommendations, including that DOE (1) supplement the 2016 review by conducting an additional analysis, (2) ensure that the agency periodically reexamines the size of the SPR, and (3) consider a full range of options for handling potentially excess assets as it conducts its study, among other things. DOE agreed with two, partially agreed with one, and disagreed with another recommendation on refined product reserve studies. GAO maintains that the recommendations are valid."], "length": 27217}

The National Park Service, on the other hand, has no general authority to acquire land to create new park units or dispose of park lands. The agencies' acquisition and disposal authorities are designed to allow federal agencies to acquire lands that benefit from federal management and dispose of land that is no longer required for a federal purpose. The federal government's land ownership is a contentious issue, with some advocating for divestment of lands and others supporting the policy of retaining lands in federal ownership. The Land and Water Conservation Fund is the principal financing mechanism for federal land acquisition, with Congress determining the level of appropriations each year. The agencies have different standing authorities for acquiring and disposing of lands, with the Bureau of Land Management having the broadest authorities. The General Mining Law of 1872 allows access to and development of hardrock minerals on federal lands, but a series of annual moratoria has effectively prevented this means of federal land disposal since FY1995. The Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act of 1998 allows the Secretary of the Interior to sell or exchange certain lands around Las Vegas, with 85% of the proceeds deposited into a special account for land acquisition in Nevada and other purposes.

The extent to which each of these four federal agencies have authority to acquire and dispose of land varies considerably. The BLM has relatively broad authority for both acquisitions and disposals under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA). The agency also has other authorities for disposing of land, including two laws that allow the agency to retain the proceeds for subsequent land acquisition, among other purposes, and a law that allows transfers to governmental units and other entities for public purposes. By contrast, the NPS has no general authority to acquire land to create new park units or to dispose of park lands. The FS authority to acquire lands is mostly limited to lands within or contiguous to the boundaries of a national forest. The agency has various authorities to dispose of land, but they are relatively constrained and infrequently used. The FWS has various authorities to acquire lands but no general authority to dispose of its lands. The agency frequently uses acquisition authority under the Migratory Bird Conservation Act of 1929 because of the availability of funding through the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund. The nature of the acquisition and disposal authorities of the four federal agencies also varies. In general, the acquisition authorities are designed to allow the four agencies to bring into federal ownership lands that many contend could benefit from federal management. Disposal authorities generally are designed to allow agencies to convey land that is no longer needed for a federal purpose or that might be chiefly valuable for another purpose. Some of the authorities specify particular circumstances where they can be used, such as the conveyance of FS land for educational purposes and the disposal of BLM land for recreation and public purposes. Congress often faces questions on the adequacy of existing acquisition and disposal authorities; the nature, extent, and location of their use; and the extent of federal land ownership overall. The current acquisition and disposal authorities form the backdrop for consideration of measures to establish, modify, or eliminate authorities, or to provide for the acquisition or disposal of particular lands. In some cases, Congress enacts bills to provide authority to acquire or dispose of particular parcels where no standing authority exists and, in other cases, to direct or facilitate land transactions. Congress also addresses acquisition and disposal policy in the context of debates on the role and goals of the federal government in owning and managing land generally, and it has considered broader measures to dispose of lands or to promote acquisition. Other issues for Congress pertain to the sources and levels of funds for land acquisition. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) is the primary source of funding for land acquisition.

About half of the people who reported misusing prescription drugs in 2015 received them from a friend or relative. One way to help prevent this kind of diversion and potential misuse is by providing secure and convenient ways to dispose of unused, unneeded, or expired prescription medications. The Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010 authorizes pharmacies and other entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances to also collect unused prescription drugs for disposal. In 2014, DEA finalized regulations for the implementation of the Act, establishing a voluntary process for eligible entities to become authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs using disposal bins. GAO was asked to review participation among authorized collectors that maintain disposal bins. In this report GAO describes (1) participation rates among entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs and (2) factors that affect participation. GAO analyzed the most currently available DEA data from April 2017 on entities eligible to participate and those participating as authorized collectors. GAO also conducted interviews with DEA officials and a nongeneralizable sample of 11 stakeholder organizations selected to illustrate different types of authorized collectors and long-term care facilities. GAO is not making any recommendations. DEA provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. GAO found that about 3 percent of pharmacies and other entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs for disposal have volunteered to do so. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) authorizes these entities to dispose of unused drugs to help reduce their potential misuse. Analysis of DEA data shows that as of April 2017, 2,233 of the 89,550 (2.49 percent) eligible entities—that is, certain entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances—had registered with DEA to use disposal bins to collect unused prescription drugs. Most—about 81 percent—of the authorized collectors were pharmacies, followed by hospitals or clinics. GAO also found that participation rates varied by state, though in 44 states less than 5 percent of the state's pharmacies and other eligible entities had registered to become authorized collectors. Stakeholders cited several factors that may explain why relatively few pharmacies and other eligible entities have registered with DEA as authorized collectors of unused drugs. Most notably, stakeholders representing authorized collectors told GAO that because participation is voluntary, the cost associated with maintaining a disposal bin—which includes purchasing and installing the bin according to DEA requirements and paying for the destruction of its contents—is an important factor to weigh against potential benefits. DEA noted that availability of disposal by law enforcement agencies also contributes to low participation."], "length": 26822}

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has designated Medicare as a \"high priority\" program due to improper payments exceeding $750 million annually. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has taken steps to address fraud, waste, and abuse, including collaborating with contractors, health-insurance plans, and law-enforcement agencies. However, CMS has not conducted a comprehensive fraud risk assessment for Medicare, which is necessary to identify and mitigate fraud risks. The Fraud Risk Framework, developed by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), provides a comprehensive set of key components and leading practices for agencies to use when developing efforts to combat fraud in a strategic, risk-based way. CMS has partially aligned its antifraud efforts with the Fraud Risk Framework, but has not developed a risk-based antifraud strategy for Medicare. The GAO recommends that CMS conduct fraud risk assessments for Medicare and Medicaid, including respective fraud risk profiles and plans for regularly updating the assessments and profiles. Overall, the passage highlights the need for CMS to take a more comprehensive and strategic approach to addressing fraud risks in Medicare. The key evidence presented includes the designation of Medicare as a high-risk program, the improper payments exceeding $750 million annually, and the lack of a comprehensive fraud risk assessment. The unique point made is the importance of a risk-based antifraud strategy in addressing fraud risks in Medicare.

However, the billions of dollars in Medicare outlays as well as program complexity make it susceptible to improper payments, including fraud. Although there are no reliable estimates of fraud in Medicare, in fiscal year 2017 improper payments for Medicare were estimated at about $52 billion. Further, about $1.4 billion was returned to Medicare Trust Funds in fiscal year 2017 as a result of recoveries, fines, and asset forfeitures. In December 2017, GAO issued a report examining how CMS managed its fraud risks overall and particularly the extent to which its efforts in the Medicare and Medicaid programs aligned with GAO's Framework. This testimony, based on that report, discusses the extent to which CMS's management of fraud risks in Medicare aligns with the Framework. For the report, GAO reviewed CMS policies and interviewed officials and external stakeholders. In its December 2017 report, GAO found that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) antifraud efforts for Medicare partially align with GAO's 2015 A Framework for Managing Fraud Risks in Federal Programs (Framework). The Fraud Reduction and Data Analytics Act of 2015 required OMB to incorporate leading practices identified in this Framework in its guidance to agencies on addressing fraud risks. Consistent with the Framework, GAO determined that CMS had demonstrated commitment to combating fraud by creating a dedicated entity to lead antifraud efforts; the Center for Program Integrity (CPI) serves as this entity for fraud, waste, and abuse issues in Medicare. CMS also promoted an antifraud culture by, for example, coordinating with internal stakeholders to incorporate antifraud features into new program design. To increase awareness of fraud risks in Medicare, CMS offered and required training for stakeholder groups such as providers of medical services, but it did not offer or require similar fraud-awareness training for most of its workforce. CMS took some steps to identify fraud risks in Medicare; however, it had not conducted a fraud risk assessment or designed and implemented a risk-based antifraud strategy for Medicare as defined in the Framework. CMS identified fraud risks through control activities that target areas the agency designated as higher risk within Medicare, including specific provider types, such as home health agencies. Building on earlier steps and conducting a fraud risk assessment, consistent with the Framework, would provide the detailed information and insights needed to create a fraud risk profile, which, in turn, is the basis for creating an antifraud strategy. CMS established monitoring and evaluation mechanisms for its program-integrity control activities that, if aligned with an antifraud strategy, could enhance the effectiveness of fraud risk management in Medicare. For example, CMS used return-on-investment and savings estimates to measure the effectiveness of its Medicare program-integrity activities. In developing an antifraud strategy, consistent with the Framework, CMS could include plans for refining and building on existing methods such as return-on-investment, to evaluate the effectiveness of all of its antifraud efforts. In its December 2017 report, GAO made three recommendations, namely that CMS (1) require and provide fraud-awareness training to its employees; (2) conduct fraud risk assessments; and (3) create an antifraud strategy for Medicare, including an approach for evaluation. The Department of Health and Human Services agreed with these recommendations and reportedly is evaluating options to implement them. Accordingly, the recommendations remain open."], "length": 25553}

The key evidence presented includes data from the National 911 Progress Report and the Eighth Annual Report to Congress on State Collection and Distribution of 911 and Enhanced 911 Fees and Charges, which show that while some states have made progress in implementing NG911, many others are facing significant challenges. The unique point made in the passage is that the NG911 transition is not just a technical challenge, but also a governance challenge, as states and localities must work together to develop new policies and procedures for managing NG911 systems. The passage also highlights the importance of federal leadership in supporting the NG911 transition, and notes that the National 911 Program has taken steps to develop a National NG911 Roadmap to guide the transition. However, the passage also notes that the National 911 Program lacks specific goals and performance measures to assess its progress, and that the program's strategic plan is outdated and does not contain specific goals or performance measures related to 911 or NG911 implementation. The passage concludes by recommending that the National 911 Program develop specific program goals and performance measures related to NG911 implementation, and that the program develop an implementation plan to support the completion of the National NG911 Roadmap's national-level tasks. \n\nThe main arguments of Passage 3 are that the Holman rule is a congressional rule that separates general legislation from appropriations, and that it has been interpreted through precedents to narrow its application over time. The key evidence presented includes historical data on the development of the Holman rule, which shows that it has been modified and reinserted into House rules several times since its initial adoption in the 19th century. The unique point made in the passage is that the Holman rule is not intended to open the door for legislative provisions that would expand the scope of the bill, and that even with the additional scope provided by the language of the separate order, it would likely not be in order to include broad legislative provisions in, or amendments to, a specific appropriation bill. The passage also notes that the Holman rule is not applicable to funds other than those appropriated in the pending general appropriations bill, and that the application of the broader exceptions in the separate order were still subject to the general requirement for germaneness.

However, the nation's legacy 911 system relies on aging infrastructure that is not designed to accommodate modern communications technologies. As a result, states and localities are upgrading to NG911, which offers improved capabilities, such as the ability to process images, audio files, and video. While deploying NG911 is the responsibility of state and local entities, federal agencies also support implementation, led by NHTSA's National 911 Program, which facilitates collaboration among federal, state, and local 911 stakeholders. GAO was asked to review NG911 implementation nationwide. This report examines: (1) state and local progress and challenges in implementing NG911 and (2) federal actions to address challenges and planned next steps. GAO reviewed relevant statutes, regulations, and federal agency reports and plans. GAO also analyzed NHTSA's survey data on state 911 implementation for calendar year 2015, the most recent year for which data were available, and interviewed federal officials, state and local officials from nine states (selected to represent different regions and various phases of NG911 implementation), and officials from industry and advocacy groups. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) National 911 Program's most recent national survey on Next Generation 911 (NG911) implementation indicated that about half of states were in some phase of transition to NG911 in 2015, but that state and local progress varied. Specifically, 10 states reported that all 911 authorities in their state processed calls using NG911 systems; however, 18 states reported having no state or local NG911 transition plans in place—which may indicate these states were in the early phases of planning for the transition to NG911 or had not yet begun. GAO spoke with state and local 911 officials in 9 states, which were in various phases of implementing NG911, and found that none of the 9 selected states were accepting images, audio files, or video. State and local 911 officials identified a number of challenges to implementing NG911. Such challenges are related to funding, evolving technology and operations, and governance. For example, officials in 3 states said that the current funding they collect from telephone service subscribers may not be sufficient to support NG911's transition costs while simultaneously funding the operation of existing 911 systems. Federal agencies—including NHTSA, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, the Federal Communications Commission, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security—have responsibilities to support NG911 implementation, such as through coordinating activities and administering grants, and are taking actions to assist state and local entities in addressing challenges to NG911's implementation. Such actions include developing resources, offering technical assistance, and convening stakeholders to explore emerging NG911 issues. For example, as the lead entity for coordinating federal NG911 efforts, NHTSA's National 911 Program is developing resources on NG911 topics, such as federal funding and governance structures. While the National 911 Program is taking steps to facilitate the state and local transition to NG911, the program lacks specific performance goals and measures to assess its progress. Without such goals and measures, it is not clear to what extent the program is effectively achieving its mission. In 2018, the National 911 Program plans to establish an interagency initiative tasked with creating a National NG911 Roadmap. This roadmap is intended to identify next steps for the federal government in supporting the creation of a national, interconnected NG911 system. While the National 911 Program is taking steps to develop a list of national-level tasks as part of its roadmap initiative, the program does not have a plan to identify: (1) roles or responsibilities for federal entities to carry out these tasks or (2) how the program plans to achieve the roadmap's objectives. Collaborating with the appropriate federal agencies to determine federal roles and responsibilities to carry out the roadmap's national-level tasks could reduce barriers to agencies effectively working together to achieve those tasks. Furthermore, developing an implementation plan that details how the roadmap's tasks will be achieved would place the National 911 Program in a better position to effectively lead interagency efforts to implement NG911 nationwide. GAO recommends that NHTSA's National 911 Program develop performance goals and measures and, for the National NG911 Roadmap, determine agencies' roles and responsibilities and develop an implementation plan.

The VA has a large inventory of vacant or underutilized buildings, many of which are historic and difficult to renovate or demolish. The VA has not consistently followed best practices for engaging stakeholders, leading to adversarial relationships and reduced ability to align facilities with veteran needs. The VA's Strategic Capital Investment Planning (SCIP) process has limitations, including subjective narratives, long timeframes, and restricted access to information, which undermine its ability to achieve its goals. The VA has also encountered challenges with its facility master plans, which assume all future growth in services will be provided directly through VA facilities, rather than through non-VA providers. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommends that the VA address these limitations and improve stakeholder communication.

DOD has repeatedly applied the BRAC process to reduce the amount of unneeded property that it owns and leases and to save billions of dollars that could be applied to higher priority defense needs. This statement is based on GAO's April 2017 report related to VA facility alignment ( GAO-17-349 ) and numerous GAO reports related to the BRAC process as summarized in a June 2011 testimony ( GAO-11-704T ) and a March 2012 testimony ( GAO-12-513T ). This statement addresses (1) the factors that affect VA's facility alignment and the extent to which VA's capital-planning process facilitates the alignment of facilities with the veterans' population, and (2) the key elements and challenges affecting DOD and the Commission in BRAC 2005. Detailed information on our scope and methodologies for this work can be found in these published products, cited throughout this testimony. Geographic shifts in the veterans' population, changes in health care delivery, aging infrastructure, and limited stakeholder involvement affect the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) efforts to align its services and real property portfolio to meet the needs of veterans. For example, a shift over time from inpatient to outpatient care will likely result in underutilized space once used for inpatient care. Further, the historic status of some VA facilities adds to the complexity of converting or disposing of them. In such instances, it is often difficult and costly for VA to modernize, renovate, and retrofit these older facilities. GAO reported that two of the planning processes VA uses to align its facilities—VA's Strategic Capital Investment Planning (SCIP) and the VA Integrated Planning (VAIP)—have limitations that undermine VA's efforts to achieve its goals. Specifically: VA relies on the SCIP process to plan and prioritize capital projects, but VA routinely asks its facility planners to submit their next year's planned project narratives before knowing if their previous submissions have been funded. The overlapping budget cycle, which is outside of VA's control, combined with other SCIP limitations—including subjective narratives, long time frames, and restricted access to information—make it difficult for VA to rely on SCIP to accurately identify the capital necessary to address its service and infrastructure gaps. VA concurred that it needs to address SCIP limitations that are within its control, as GAO recommended; VA has made some progress in implementing the recommendation has made some progress in implementing the recommendation.\\ The VAIP process is estimated to cost $108 million and to produce market-level service delivery plans and facility master plans. However, the VAIP master plans incorrectly assume that all future growth in services will be provided directly through VA facilities without considering alternatives, such as purchasing care from the community. GAO recommended that VA consider discontinuing the VAIP facility master plans pending an assessment of their value as a facility-planning tool. VA agreed with the recommendation and is implementing it while pursuing a national realignment strategy.. Key elements of the Department of Defense's (DOD) 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process could benefit VA's asset and infrastructure review. The key elements included: (1) establishing goals for the process, (2) developing criteria for evaluating closures and realignments, and (3) establishing an organizational structure to develop closure and realignment options. GAO identified key challenges that affected DOD's implementation of BRAC 2005 and the results achieved; these challenges would need to be addressed if VA is to successfully apply the process. These challenges included: (1) large, complex recommendations required sustained senior leadership's attention and a high level of coordination among many stakeholders, and (2) the large number of actions that depend on each other for successful implementation.

The Trust Fund's revenue has consistently fallen short of its expenditures, resulting in a debt of over $4.3 billion in 2017. The Trust Fund's debt is expected to increase to $15.4 billion by 2050, with annual deficits projected to exceed $100 million from 2020 to 2050. The Trust Fund's financial situation is further complicated by the scheduled 2019 tax rate decrease, which will reduce revenue by approximately 55%. To address the Trust Fund's financial challenges, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) simulated various options, including adjusting the coal tax, forgiving interest, and forgiving debt. The simulations suggest that increasing the coal tax by 25% could balance the Trust Fund by 2050 without debt forgiveness, while maintaining current tax rates could balance the Trust Fund with approximately $2.4 billion in debt forgiveness. The GAO also simulated the effects of forgiving interest and debt, finding that these options would not eliminate debt by 2050. The Trust Fund's financial situation is critical, and policymakers must consider various options to ensure the Fund's solvency and provide benefits to eligible miners and their families. The GAO's simulations provide valuable insights into the Trust Fund's financial challenges and potential solutions, highlighting the need for policymakers to take action to address the Fund's debt and ensure its long-term sustainability.

However, the Trust Fund also borrowed about $1.3 billion from the Treasury's general fund in fiscal year 2017 to cover its debt repayment expenditures. Adding to this financial challenge, the coal tax that supports the Trust Fund is scheduled to decrease by about 55 percent beginning in 2019. GAO was asked to review the financial positon of the Trust Fund and identify options to improve it. This report examines (1) factors that have challenged the financial position of the Trust Fund since its inception and (2) the extent to which Trust Fund debt may change through 2050, and selected options that could improve its future financial position. GAO reviewed Trust Fund financial data from fiscal years 1979 through 2017. GAO also interviewed officials from the Departments of Labor, Treasury, Health and Human Services (HHS) and representatives of coal industry and union groups. Using assumptions, such as the about 55 percent coal tax decrease and moderately declining coal production, GAO simulated the extent to which Trust Fund debt may change through 2050. GAO also simulated how selected options, such as forgiveness of debt, could improve finances. The options simulated are not intended to be exhaustive. Further, GAO is not endorsing any particular option or combination of options. GAO provided a draft of this report to DOL, Treasury, and HHS. The agencies provided technical comments, which were incorporated as appropriate. Multiple factors have challenged Black Lung Disability Trust Fund (Trust Fund) finances since it was established about 40 years ago. Its expenditures have consistently exceeded its revenues, interest payments have grown, and actions taken that were expected to improve Trust Fund finances did not completely address its debt. When necessary to make expenditures, the Trust Fund borrows with interest from the Department of the Treasury's (Treasury) general fund. Because Trust Fund expenditures have consistently exceeded revenue, it has borrowed almost every year since 1979, its first complete fiscal year, and as a result debt and interest payments increased. Legislative actions were taken over the years including (1) raising the rate of the coal tax that provides Trust Fund revenues and (2) forgiving debt. For example, the Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008 provided an appropriation toward Trust Fund debt forgiveness; about $6.5 billion was forgiven, according to Department of Labor (DOL) data (see figure). However, coal tax revenues were less than expected due, in part, to the 2008 recession and increased competition from other energy sources, according to DOL and Treasury officials. As a result, the Trust Fund continued to borrow from Treasury's general fund from fiscal years 2010 through 2017 to cover debt repayment expenditures. GAO's simulation suggests that Trust Fund borrowing will likely increase from fiscal years 2019 through 2050 due, in part, to the coal tax rate decrease of about 55 percent that will take effect in 2019 and declining coal production. The simulation estimates that Trust Fund borrowing may exceed $15 billion by 2050 (see figure). However, various options, such as adjusting the coal tax and forgiving interest or debt, could reduce future borrowing and improve the Trust Fund's financial position. For example, maintaining the current coal tax rates and forgiving debt of $2.4 billion could, under certain circumstances, balance the Trust Fund by 2050, whereby revenue would be sufficient to cover expenditures. However, a coal industry representative said that maintaining or increasing the coal tax would burden the coal industry, particularly at a time when coal production has been declining. Further, Treasury officials noted that the costs associated with forgiving Trust Fund interest or debt would be paid by taxpayers."], "length": 26404}

Three space telescope projects are the key enablers for NASA to achieve its astrophysics' science goals, which include seeking to understand the universe. In its fiscal year 2018 budget request, NASA asked for about $697 million for these three projects, which represents over 50 percent of NASA's budget for its astrophysics' major projects. In total, these projects represent an expected investment of at least $12.4 billion. This statement reflects preliminary observations on (1) the current status and cost of NASA's major telescope projects and (2) lessons learned that can be applied to NASA's management of its telescope projects. This statement is based on ongoing work on JWST and ongoing work on the status of NASA's major projects. Both reports are planned to be published in Spring 2018. This statement is also based on past GAO reports on JWST and NASA's acquisitions of major projects, and NASA input. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) current portfolio of major space telescopes includes three projects that vary in cost, complexity, and phase of the acquisition life cycle. GAO's ongoing work indicates that these projects are each making progress in line with their phase of the acquisition cycle but also face some challenges. For example, the current launch date for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) project reflects a 57-60-month delay from the project's original schedule. GAO's preliminary observations indicate this project still has significant integration and testing to complete, with very little schedule reserve remaining to account for delays. Therefore, additional delays beyond the delay of up to 8 months recently announced are likely, and funding available under the $8 billion Congressional cost cap for formulation and development may be inadequate. There are a number of lessons learned from its acquisitions that NASA could consider to increase the likelihood of successful outcomes for its telescope projects, as well as for its larger portfolio of projects, such as its human spaceflight projects. For example, twice in the history of the JWST program, independent reviews found that the program was not holding adequate cost and schedule reserves. GAO has found that NASA has not applied this lesson learned to all of its large projects, and similar outcomes to JWST have started to emerge. For example, NASA did not incorporate this lesson with its human spaceflight programs. In July 2016 and April 2017, GAO found that these programs were holding inadequate levels of cost and schedule reserves to cover unexpected cost increases or delays. In April 2017, GAO recommended that NASA reassess the date of the programs' first test flight. NASA concurred and, in November 2017, announced a launch delay of up to 19 months.

{"pred": " Passage 2\nThe federal government has invested over $96 billion in IT in fiscal year 2018, but many IT projects have failed, resulting in cost overruns and schedule slippages. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has identified several failed IT projects, including the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System, which spent 16 years and almost $5 billion, and the Department of Homeland Security's Secure Border Initiative Network program, which was ended after spending over $1 billion. The GAO has found that these failures are often due to a lack of disciplined and effective management, such as project planning, requirements definition, and program oversight and governance. The GAO has also identified security deficiencies in federal agencies, including the Department of Education's Office of Federal Student Aid, which did not consistently analyze privacy risks for its electronic information systems. The Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) aims to improve federal IT management, but the GAO has found that agencies have not fully implemented the law's requirements, including the role of Chief Information Officers (CIOs). The GAO has made several recommendations to improve federal IT management, including enhancing CIO authority, consolidating data centers, and managing software licenses. Despite these efforts, the GAO has found that many agencies have not implemented these recommendations, and the federal government continues to face challenges in managing its IT investments. The GAO has also identified several areas for improvement, including the management of software licenses, which could result in significant cost savings. Overall, the GAO's findings suggest that the federal government needs to improve its IT management practices to avoid costly failures and ensure the effective use of taxpayer dollars.

Historically, IT investments have too often failed or contributed little to mission-related outcomes. Further, increasingly sophisticated threats and frequent cyber incidents underscore the need for effective information security. As a result, GAO added two areas to its high-risk list: IT security in 1997 and the management of IT acquisitions and operations in 2015. This statement summarizes agencies' progress in improving IT management and ensuring the security of federal IT. It is primarily based on GAO's prior reports issued between February 1997 and May 2018 (and an ongoing review) on (1) CIO responsibilities, (2) agency CIOs' involvement in approving IT contracts, (3) data center consolidation efforts, (4) the management of software licenses, and (5) compliance with cybersecurity requirements. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and federal agencies have taken steps to improve the management of information technology (IT) acquisitions and operations and ensure the security of federal IT through a series of initiatives. As of May 2018, agencies had fully implemented about 61 percent of the approximately 800 IT management-related recommendations that GAO made from fiscal years 2010 through 2015. Likewise, since 2010, agencies had implemented about 66 percent of the approximately 2,700 security-related recommendations as of May 2018. Even with this progress, significant actions remain to be completed. Chief Information Officer (CIO) responsibilities . Laws such as the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) and related guidance assigned 35 key IT management responsibilities to CIOs to help address longstanding challenges. However, in a draft report on CIO responsibilities, GAO's preliminary results suggest that none of the 24 selected agencies have policies that fully address the role of their CIO, as called for by federal laws and guidance. GAO intends to recommend that OMB and each of the selected 24 agencies take actions to improve the effectiveness of CIO's implementation of their responsibilities. IT contract approval . According to FITARA, covered agencies' CIOs are required to review and approve IT contracts. Nevertheless, in January 2018, GAO reported that most of the CIOs at 22 selected agencies were not adequately involved in reviewing billions of dollars of IT acquisitions. Consequently, GAO made 39 recommendations to improve CIO oversight over IT acquisitions. Consolidating data centers . OMB launched an initiative in 2010 to reduce data centers, which was codified and expanded in FITARA. According to agencies, data center consolidation and optimization efforts have resulted in approximately $3.9 billion of cost savings through 2018. Even so, additional work remains. GAO has made 160 recommendations to OMB and agencies to improve the reporting of related cost savings and to achieve optimization targets; however, as of May 2018, 80 of the recommendations have not been fully addressed. Managing software licenses . Effective management of software licenses can help avoid purchasing too many licenses that result in unused software. In May 2014, GAO reported that better management of licenses was needed to achieve savings, and made 135 recommendations to improve such management. Four years later, 78 of the recommendations remained open. Improving the security of federal IT systems . While the government has acted to protect federal information systems, agencies need to improve security programs, cyber capabilities, and the protection of personally identifiable information. Over the last several years, GAO has made about 2,700 recommendations to agencies aimed at improving the security of federal systems and information. These recommendations identified actions for agencies to take to strengthen their information security programs and technical controls over their computer networks and systems. As of May 2018, about 800 of the information security-related recommendations had not been implemented. From fiscal years 2010 through 2015, GAO made about 800 recommendations to OMB and federal agencies to address shortcomings in IT acquisitions and operations. Since 2010, GAO also made about 2,700 recommendations to federal agencies to improve the security of federal systems. These recommendations include those to improve the implementation of CIO responsibilities, the oversight of the data center consolidation initiative, software license management efforts, and the strength of security programs and technical controls. Most agencies agreed with these recommendations, and GAO will continue to monitor their implementation."], "length": 25030}

The dream features a tattoo of the word \"Chesty\" on his arm and a man named Gil Chesterton, who is a food critic. Frasier's brother Niles suggests that the dream may be a manifestation of Frasier's unconscious mind, and that the tattoo may be a symbol of his desire for food or his own body. Frasier is initially resistant to this interpretation, but eventually comes to see it as a possible explanation for his dream. However, the dream continues to recur, and Frasier becomes increasingly frustrated with his inability to interpret it. The dream is eventually revealed to be a manifestation of Frasier's own desires and fears, and he comes to see it as a way of exploring his own psyche.\n\nSummary: Passage 3\nThe invention relates to a method for simulating blood flow in a vascular segment of a patient during angiography examinations.

To accomplish this mission, NASA establishes programs and projects that rely on complex instruments and spacecraft. NASA's portfolio of major projects ranges from space satellites equipped with advanced sensors to study the Earth to a telescope intended to explore the universe to spacecraft to transport humans and cargo to and beyond low-Earth orbit. Some of NASA's projects are expected to incorporate new and sophisticated technologies that must operate in harsh, distant environments. The life cycle for NASA space flight projects consists of two phases—formulation, which takes a project from concept to preliminary design, and implementation, which includes building, launching, and operating the system, among other activities. NASA further divides formulation and implementation into phase A through phase F. Major projects must get approval from senior NASA officials at key decision points before they can enter each new phase. The agency baseline commitment established at key decision point C includes cost and schedule reserves held at the project—those within the project manager’s control—and NASA headquarters level.

The method involves obtaining a 3D image dataset of the examination region, generating a 3D vascular model, capturing a contrast agent propagation, and inputting blood flow parameters. The CFD simulation is then performed with the inclusion of these blood flow parameters, and virtual 2D angiography recordings are generated from the results. A degree of correspondence is determined between the real and virtual 2D angiography recordings, and the CFD simulation is iteratively optimized based on this degree of correspondence. The method enables the CFD simulation results to be validated for the individual patient, allowing for the quantification of deviations and iterative improvement of the simulation. The degree of correspondence is a novel aspect of the method, allowing for the evaluation of the correspondence between the virtual and real angiography without relying on extracting specific flow information from 2D angiography. The method is particularly useful for validating CFD simulations for individual patients, where basic conditions such as geometry, inflow and outflow values, blood characteristics, and local elastic characteristics of the vascular wall are not sufficiently precisely known.

{"pred": " Passage 4\nThe Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant is a federal program that provides financial assistance to low-income families. The program was created in 1996 and has undergone several changes since its inception. The main federal work requirement for TANF is a performance measure that applies to states, rather than individual recipients. States determine the work rules that apply to individual recipients, and the TANF statute requires states to have 50% of their caseload meet standards of participation in work or activities. However, the statutory work participation standards are reduced by a \"caseload reduction credit,\" which allows states to earn extra credit for reducing their caseload. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 made several changes to the work participation rules, including broadening the definition of work-eligible individuals and requiring states to develop plans and procedures to verify work activities. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 held states \"harmless\" for caseload increases affecting the work participation standards for FY2009 through FY2011. The national average all-families work participation rate has increased since FY2002, but the increase has not come from an increase in the number of recipients in regular TANF assistance programs who are either working or in job preparation activities. Instead, the increase stems from states creating new \"earnings supplement\" programs that use TANF funds to aid working parents in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) or who have left the regular TANF assistance programs for work. In FY2017, two jurisdictions did not meet the all-family participation standard: Nevada and Guam. The TANF program has undergone several changes since its inception, and the work participation standards have been adjusted to reflect these changes.

TANF was created in the 1996 welfare reform law (P.L. 104-193). This report responds to some frequently asked questions about TANF; it does not describe TANF rules (see, instead, CRS Report RL32748, The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Block Grant: A Primer on TANF Financing and Federal Requirements, by Gene Falk). TANF Funding and Expenditures. TANF provides fixed funding for the 50 states, the District of Columbia, the territories, and American Indian tribes. The basic block grant totals $16.5 billion per year. States are also required in total to contribute, from their own funds, at least $10.3 billion annually under a maintenance-of-effort (MOE) requirement. Though TANF is best known for funding cash assistance payments for needy families with children, the block grant and MOE funds are used for a wide variety of benefits and activities. In FY2017, expenditures on basic assistance totaled $7.1 billion—23% of total federal TANF and MOE dollars. Basic assistance is often—but not exclusively—paid as cash. In addition to funding basic assistance, TANF also contributes funds for child care and services for children who have been, or are at risk of being, abused and neglected. Some states also count expenditures in prekindergarten programs toward the MOE requirement. The TANF Assistance Caseload. A total of 1.2 million families, composed of 3.1 million recipients, received TANF- or MOE-funded assistance in September 2018. The bulk of the \"recipients\" were children—2.3 million in that month. The assistance caseload is heterogeneous. The type of family once thought of as the \"typical\" assistance family—one with an unemployed adult recipient—accounted for 32% of all families on the rolls in FY2016. Additionally, 31% of cash assistance families had an employed adult, while 38% of all TANF families were \"child-only\" and had no adult recipient. Child-only families include those with disabled adults receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI), adults who are nonparents (e.g., grandparents, aunts, uncles) caring for children, and families consisting of citizen children and ineligible noncitizen parents. Cash Assistance Benefits. TANF cash benefit amounts are set by states. In July 2017, the maximum monthly benefit for a family of three ranged from $1,021 in New Hampshire to $170 in Mississippi. Only New Hampshire (at 60% of the federal poverty guidelines) had a maximum TANF cash assistance amount for this sized family in excess of 50% of poverty-level income. Work Requirements. TANF's main federal work requirement is actually a performance measure that applies to the states. States determine the work rules that apply to individual recipients. TANF law requires states to engage 50% of all families and 90% of two-parent families with work-eligible individuals in work activities, though these standards can be reduced by \"credits.\" Therefore, the effective standards states face are often less than the 50% or 90% targets, and vary by state. In FY2017, states achieved, on average, an all-family participation rate of 53.0% and a two-parent rate of 69.5%. In FY2017, two jurisdictions did not meet the all-family participation standard: Nevada and Guam. This is a reduction from FY2012, when 16 states did not meet that standard. In FY2017, nine jurisdictions did not meet the two-parent standard. States that do not meet work standards are at risk of being penalized by a reduction in their block grant."], "length": 25776}

The policy also requires agencies to submit annual Real Property Efficiency Plans (Plans) to GSA and OMB, which outline their strategies for reducing office and warehouse space. The Plans must include potential projects related to office and warehouse consolidation, co-location, disposal, as well as construction and acquisition efforts. The RTF policy has led to significant reductions in office and warehouse space, with 15 of the 24 CFO Act agencies reporting plans to reduce their space by consolidating their offices or operations.

GSA provides space for agencies in government-owned and commercially leased buildings. In 2015, the OMB issued a memorandum requiring the 24 agencies with chief financial officers to reduce their domestic office and warehouse space. These agencies are required to set annual reduction targets for a 5-year time period and update their real property plans annually. GAO was asked to review the implementation of this space reduction initiative. This report discusses: (1) the approaches and any challenges the 24 agencies identified to achieving their reduction targets for all their domestic office and warehouse space; (2) the extent these agencies reduced their space and met their fiscal year 2016 targets; and (3) how GSA manages vacated space it had leased to these agencies. GAO conducted a content analysis of the 24 agencies' real property plans for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 and analyzed agencies' data as submitted to GSA on their targets and reductions for fiscal year 2016, the only year for which data were available. GAO selected five agencies as case studies based on several factors, including size of the agencies' office and warehouse portfolio, agency reduction targets, and fiscal year 2016 reported reductions. GAO reviewed relevant documentation and interviewed officials from GSA, OMB, and GAO's case study agencies. GAO provided a draft of this product to GSA, OMB, and our case study agencies for comment. GAO incorporated technical comments, as appropriate. Most of the 24 agencies with chief financial officers reported to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the General Services Administration (GSA) that they planned to consolidate their office and warehouse space and allocate fewer square feet per employee as the key ways to achieve their space reduction targets. For example, the Department of Agriculture reported it will consolidate staff from five component agencies in two office buildings. When complete, the space allocated per employee will average about 250 square feet down from a high of 420 square feet per employee. In taking these actions, the agencies most often identified the cost of space reduction projects as a challenge to achieving their targets. Agencies cited costs such as for space renovations to accommodate more staff and required environmental clean-up before disposing of property as challenges to completing projects. Some agencies required to maintain offices across the country reported that their mission requirements limit their ability to reduce their space. In fiscal year 2016, 17 of the 24 agencies reported they reduced their space, but had varying success achieving their first-year targets. Of the 17 agencies, 9 exceeded their target and reduced more space than planned, 7 missed their target (by anywhere between 2.8 and 96.7 percent), and 1 reduced space, despite a targeted increase. Agency officials said that it is not unusual for projects to shift to different years and that such shifts could lead to missing targets one year and exceeding them the next. GSA has processes to manage the space vacated by agencies that is leased through GSA. For example, starting in November 2016, GSA started tracking agencies' space release requests centrally to help standardize the process and established an e-mail address to which agencies can submit requests. GSA relies on regional offices to manage real property in their regions and to identify tenants for vacant space or to remove unused space from the inventory. GSA's regional officials said regular monitoring and coordinating with agencies minimizes the likelihood GSA is caught off guard by a return of space. These processes also help them to plan ahead. GSA met its 2016 performance goal to have an annual vacant space rate of no more than 3.2 percent in its federally owned and leased buildings. However, given the recent implementation of the space reduction initiative, it is too early to determine the extent to which agencies will return space to GSA prior to the end of their leases and the effect on GSA's inventory."], "length": 26814}

In 2017, U.S. plans and IRAs reportedly held investments worth nearly $17 trillion dollars. Federal law also allows individuals to withdraw assets from these accounts under certain circumstances. DOL and IRS oversee 401(k) plans, and collect annual plan data—including financial information—on the Form 5500. For both IRAs and 401(k) plans, GAO was asked to examine: (1) the incidence and amount of early withdrawals; (2) factors that might lead individuals to access retirement savings early; and (3) policies and strategies that might reduce the incidence and amounts of early withdrawals. To answer these questions, GAO analyzed data from IRS, the Census Bureau, and DOL from 2013 (the most recent complete data available); and interviewed a diverse range of stakeholders identified in the literature, including representatives of companies sponsoring 401(k) plans, plan administrators, subject matter experts, industry representatives, and participant advocates. In 2013 individuals in their prime working years (ages 25 to 55) removed at least $69 billion (+/- $3.5 billion) of their retirement savings early, according to GAO's analysis of 2013 Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Department of Labor (DOL) data. Withdrawals from individual retirement accounts (IRA)—$39.5 billion (+/- $2.1 billion)—accounted for much of the money removed early, were equivalent to 3 percent (+/- 0.15 percent) of the age group's total IRA assets, and exceeded their IRA contributions in 2013. Participants in employer-sponsored plans, like 401(k) plans, withdrew at least $29.2 billion (+/- $2.8 billion) early as hardship withdrawals, lump sum payments made at job separation (known as cashouts), and loan balances that borrowers did not repay. Hardship withdrawals in 2013 were equivalent to about 0.5 percent (+/-0.06 percent) of the age group's total plan assets and about 8 percent (+/- 0.9 percent) of their contributions. However, the incidence and amount of certain unrepaid plan loans cannot be determined because the Form 5500—the federal government's primary source of information on employee benefit plans—does not capture these data. Stakeholders GAO interviewed identified flexibilities in plan rules and individuals' pressing financial needs, such as out-of-pocket medical costs, as factors affecting early withdrawals of retirement savings. Stakeholders said that certain plan rules, such as setting high minimum loan thresholds, may cause individuals to take out more of their savings than they need. Stakeholders also identified several elements of the job separation process affecting early withdrawals, such as difficulties transferring account balances to a new plan and plans requiring the immediate repayment of outstanding loans, as relevant factors. Stakeholders GAO interviewed suggested strategies they believed could balance early access to accounts with the need to build long-term retirement savings. For example, plan sponsors said allowing individuals to continue to repay plan loans after job separation, restricting participant access to plan sponsor contributions, allowing partial distributions at job separation, and building emergency savings features into plan designs, could help preserve retirement savings (see figure). However, they noted, each strategy involves tradeoffs, and the strategies' broader implications require further study. GAO recommends that, as part of revising the Form 5500, DOL and IRS require plan sponsors to report the incidence and amount of all 401(k) plan loans that are not repaid. DOL and IRS neither agreed nor disagreed with our recommendation."], "length": 25753}
{"pred": " \nPassage 1 is a meeting transcript discussing the Meeting Recorder project, a research project focused on analyzing and understanding human interactions in meetings. The main arguments or conclusions of the passage are that the project is making progress, but there are still several challenges to overcome, including the need for more data and the development of a reliable method for detecting speaker overlaps. The key evidence or supporting data presented includes the discussion of the project's current state, the challenges faced by the team, and the potential solutions proposed. Unique or innovative points made in the passage include the use of a distant microphone to detect speaker overlaps and the idea of using a combination of close-talking and distant microphones to improve the accuracy of the system.\n\nPassage 2 is a report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) investigating the quality of care provided by five VA medical centers. The main arguments or conclusions of the passage are that the VA medical centers failed to conduct reviews of providers' clinical care in a timely manner and lacked adequate documentation of these reviews. The key evidence or supporting data presented includes the findings of the investigation, which showed that 26 providers did not receive focused professional practice evaluations (FPPEs) for cause, 8 providers did not receive retrospective reviews, and 16 providers did not have reviews initiated for 3 months or more after concerns were raised about their care. The report also found that the VA medical centers failed to report providers to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) and state licensing boards as required, which allowed providers who provided substandard care to obtain privileges at other VA medical centers or hospitals outside of the VA's healthcare system. Unique or innovative points made in the passage include the use of a standardized audit tool to oversee the credentialing and privileging processes at VA medical centers and the recommendation to require documentation of all reviews of providers' clinical care and to establish a timeliness requirement for initiating such reviews.  The report also highlights the need for VHA to strengthen its oversight of the reviews of providers' clinical care and to require networks to oversee VA medical centers to ensure that such reviews are documented and initiated in a timely manner.  The report concludes that VHA lacks reasonable assurance that all providers who should be reported to the NPDB and state licensing boards are reported, and that this failure facilitates providers who provide substandard care to obtain privileges at other VA medical centers or hospitals outside of the VA's healthcare system.  The report recommends that VHA require its networks to establish a process for overseeing VA medical centers to ensure they are reporting to", "answers": ["This testimony summarizes the information contained in GAO's November 2017 report, entitled VA Health Care: Improved Policies and Oversight Needed for Reviewing and Reporting Providers for Quality and Safety Concerns ( GAO-18-63 ). Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (VAMC) officials are responsible for reviewing the clinical care delivered by their privileged providers—physicians and dentists who are approved to independently perform specific services—after concerns are raised. The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care. For example, GAO found that after one VAMC failed to report to the NPDB or SLBs a provider who resigned to avoid an adverse privileging action, a non-VA hospital in the same city took an adverse privileging action against that same provider for the same reason 2 years later."], "length": 28241}
{"pred": " Passage 1\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) and the judiciary play important roles in requesting and collecting restitution. DOJ's components, including the U.S. Attorneys' Offices (USAOs), are responsible for overseeing criminal matters, including identifying and notifying victims, determining their losses, and negotiating plea agreements. The judiciary, including federal district courts, orders restitution, receives restitution payments, and disburses restitution to victims. The U.S. Sentencing Commission (USSC) collects and analyzes data on federal sentences, including restitution decisions. However, USSC data on restitution decisions are incomplete, with missing information on reasons why restitution was not ordered. The DOJ's Asset Forfeiture Program can be used to compensate victims, but the agency does not track the extent to which victims were not compensated using forfeited assets. The DOJ has identified and recommended practices for prosecutors and Financial Litigation Unit (FLU) staff to use throughout the restitution process, but these practices may not be effective in all cases or districts. The DOJ does not have measures or goals in place to assess its performance in collecting restitution, and the agency's performance in collecting restitution varies widely across USAOs. The GAO recommends that the DOJ develop and implement performance measures and goals for each USAO related to the collection of restitution and gather information on reasons why forfeited assets were not used for victim compensation. The GAO also recommends that the judiciary determine why USSC data on restitution decisions are incomplete and take action to ensure that all required information is recorded. The GAO's recommendations aim to improve the transparency and effectiveness of the restitution process. The DOJ has identified $10 billion of outstanding restitution debt that could be collected, but the agency's performance in collecting restitution varies widely across USAOs.

Various entities within the federal government are involved in the process of requesting, ordering, and collecting restitution for crime victims, including DOJ and the judiciary. The Justice for All Reauthorization Act of 2016 includes a provision for GAO to review the federal criminal restitution process for fiscal years 2014 through 2016. This report addresses, among other things: (1) the extent to which information is available on restitution requested by DOJ and ordered by courts; (2) the amount of restitution debt DOJ collected and the amount that remains outstanding; and, (3) the extent to which DOJ has conducted oversight on the collection of restitution. GAO analyzed laws, policies and procedures as well as USSC data on restitution orders and DOJ data on restitution collected from fiscal years 2014 through 2016. GAO also selected a non-generalizable sample of six federal judicial districts based on restitution collections and spoke with USAO officials and federal probation officers. Officials from selected U.S. Attorney's Offices (USAO) stated that they document requests for restitution in case files and employ other internal controls, such as the use of templates and forms, throughout the prosecution process to ensure that prosecutors request restitution as appropriate. GAO's analysis of U.S. Sentencing Commission (USSC) data—an agency within the judiciary—showed that information on restitution orders was available for 95 percent of all offenders sentenced from fiscal years 2014 through 2016. Specifically, 214,578 federal offenders were sentenced during this time period and restitution was ordered for 33,158, or 15 percent, of those offenders. Collectively, courts ordered these offenders to pay $33.9 billion in restitution. Most federal offenders sentenced during these years were sentenced for immigration or drug-related offenses. In interviews, USAO officials stated that these offenses do not typically have victims requiring restitution. GAO found that data on reasons why restitution was not ordered were incomplete for 5 percent of all offenders sentenced from fiscal years 2014 through 2016. Determining why data on restitution orders are incomplete may inform the judiciary of the cause of the incomplete data and any efforts needed to improve USSC data. GAO's analysis of Department of Justice (DOJ) data showed that USAOs collected $2.95 billion in restitution debt in fiscal years 2014 through 2016, see figure below. However, at the end of fiscal year 2016, $110 billion in previously ordered restitution remained outstanding, and USAOs identified $100 billion of that outstanding debt as uncollectible due to offenders' inability to pay. DOJ identified improving debt collection—including restitution—as a major management initiative in its 2014-2018 Strategic Plan. While DOJ is developing analytical tools to monitor the collection of restitution, it has not established performance measures or goals. Performance measures and goals would allow DOJ to gauge USAOs' success in collecting restitution and, by extension, the department's success in achieving a major management initiative. GAO is making three recommendations. GAO is making one to the judiciary to determine why data on restitution orders are incomplete. GAO is making two recommendations to DOJ, including one to implement performance measures and goals for the collection of restitution. The judiciary and DOJ concurred with the recommendations."], "length": 26292}
