To address this issue, we propose a Tandem Connectionist Encoding Network (TCEN), which is able to reuse all subnets in pre-training, keep the roles of subnets consistent, and pre-train the attention module.  Concretely, the TCEN consists of three components, a speech encoder, a text encoder, and a target text decoder.
