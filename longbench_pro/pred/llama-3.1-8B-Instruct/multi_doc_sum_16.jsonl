According to a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, nearly 30% of outpatient oral antibiotic prescriptions are unnecessary, resulting in approximately 47 million unnecessary prescriptions annually. The study found that acute respiratory conditions, such as sinusitis, ear infections, and pharyngitis, account for the majority of antibiotic prescriptions, with half of these prescriptions being unnecessary. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has warned that antibiotic overprescribing contributes to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which can lead to serious health consequences, including 2 million infections and 23,000 deaths annually. The CDC has set a goal to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use in outpatient settings by 50% by 2020, but a 15% reduction in overall antibiotic use would be necessary to meet this goal. The misuse of antibiotics is often driven by patient demand and clinician concerns about patient satisfaction, but pharmacists can play a crucial role in educating patients about the potential consequences of unnecessary antibiotic use. The CDC has identified 18 antibiotic-resistant threats in the United States, including carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, which can be spread through complex endoscopic procedures. The development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a significant public health challenge that requires a multifaceted approach to prevent and control the spread of resistance. The CDC is working to combat the threat of antibiotic resistance through various initiatives, including the National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria. The plan aims to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use in outpatient settings, improve antibiotic stewardship, and enhance surveillance and research on antibiotic resistance.

And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts—the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post—isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them. The Times notes President Obama's initiative to cut down on unnecessary outpatient antibiotic use by 50% by 2020; researchers say that, based on this study, we'll need to slash overall antibiotic use by 15% to meet that. \"If we continue down the road of inappropriate use we'll lose the most powerful tool we have to fight life-threatening infections,\" CDC Director Tom Frieden says. \"Losing these antibiotics would undermine our ability to treat patients with deadly infections [and] cancer, provide organ transplants, and save victims of burns and trauma.\" (Here's hoping teixobactin can help us out with superbugs.)"], "length": 13484}

The study, which involved 3,432 UK university staff and students aged 18-40, also found that those bereaved by suicide were 80% more likely to drop out of education or work. The researchers suggest that addressing the social stigma attached to suicide bereavement may be a way to limit its impact on people's lives. They also recommend that professionals assess suicide risk by asking about the impact of a suicidal loss and whether feeling stigmatised has prevented them from accessing help. The study's findings highlight the need for greater support and understanding for those who have been bereaved by suicide. A separate study has investigated the impact of suicide bereavement on young adults, using a population-based survey of 5,085 participants. The study found that suicide bereavement was a specific risk factor for suicide attempt, but not for suicidal ideation or depression. The researchers suggest that stigma may be a marker for motivational moderators of suicidality after a negative life event, and that psychosocial interventions delivered after a potentially traumatic loss may be beneficial. The study's findings have implications for suicide prevention strategies and highlight the need for further research into the impact of suicide bereavement on mental health.

It wants any Trump-Russia ties investigated, but complains that the \"media have been running like wildebeest after that story while ignoring how the Obama Administration might have abused domestic surveillance for its political purposes. Americans deserve to know the truth about both.\" On CNN, Don Lemon accused the \"right-wing media\" of helping the White House try to divert attention from the controversy over Trump's wiretapping claims, adding that his show will not \"aid and abet people who are trying to misinform you, the American people, by creating a diversion,\" he said, per Mediaite.

But the Times story on the subject (inside the paper) generally downplayed the significance of Rice's requests: \"Former national security officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, described the requests as normal and said they were justified by the need for the president’s top security adviser to understand the context of reports sent to her by the nation’s intelligence agencies.\""], "length": 14332}

Snowden, who worked for computer consultant Booz Allen Hamilton, a contractor for the U.S. electronic intelligence agency, said he left behind his family and a six-figure job in Hawaii to reveal the extent of the NSA's collection of telephone and Internet data, which he called \"an existential threat to democracy.\" The White House welcomed a debate over the electronic surveillance programs exposed by Snowden, but federal agents began building a case against him, searching his home and computers and seeking interviews with his girlfriend, relatives, friends, and co-workers. Snowden's revelations fueled new debate about the U.S. government's collection of records of domestic telephone calls and overseas Internet activity in the global hunt for terrorists and criminals. Supporters of the programs say they are legal and have yielded evidence that has helped put terror plotters in prison, though many of the details remain classified. Obama administration officials and leaders of the intelligence committees in Congress say the program undergoes periodic review by all three branches of government, and that the content of Americans' calls is not being monitored. Snowden's actions, while opposed by many, have also brought together some liberals and conservatives to hail him as a hero. Snowden's choice of Hong Kong as a haven from where to leak intelligence documents and to unmask himself as a whistleblower rests on calculations on the territory's press freedom safeguards and its extradition treaty with the US. Hong Kong has a high degree of autonomy and a spirited commitment to free speech and the right of political dissent, but its extradition treaty with the US makes Snowden's fate a matter of political expediency not just in Hong Kong but in Beijing.

His piece makes plain the imbalance between the dangers faced by Sherpas and the climbers they shepherd to the mountain's peak, but before arriving at that point, he shares a fascinating backstory: That of Himex, a New Zealand-based company that Krakauer calls the most \"lucrative commercial guiding operation\" on Everest—one that on May 7, 2012, packed up shop after 18 years on the mountain and headed home, taking its guides, members (aka paying climbers, who didn't see their $60,000 refunded), and Sherpas with them. The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route. As Krakauer writes, the \"wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion\" that broke free and caused last week's avalanche came from \"that same ice bulge\" and killed 16 Sherpas. As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60. Among the reasons it's gotten safer: Climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen, and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet, which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain).

The US justice department said targets included the global chemical weapons watchdog, anti-doping agencies and a US nuclear company. The Netherlands has accused four Russians of plotting to hack the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which had been probing the chemical attack on a Russian ex-spy in the UK. The UK government accused the GRU of being behind four high-profile cyber-attacks, whose targets included firms in Russia and Ukraine; the US Democratic Party; and a small TV network in the UK. The US said its anti-doping agency, football's governing body Fifa and the US nuclear energy company Westinghouse were targeted by Russian intelligence. The Dutch authorities have said a laptop seized from the suspects in April was found to have been used in Brazil, Switzerland and Malaysia. The laptop was also linked to the hacking of a laptop belonging to Wada, which has exposed doping by Russian athletes. The Russian government has dismissed the allegations as \"Western spy mania\". The US has indicted seven people, four of whom were the men expelled from the Netherlands, while the other three were among those charged in July with hacking Democratic officials during the 2016 US elections. The indictment accused the seven members of Russia's military intelligence agency, the GRU, of hacking into the world anti-doping agency, the OPCW, and of cyberattacks aimed at a U.S. nuclear energy facility. The US Department of Justice said the conspiracy conducted persistent and sophisticated computer intrusions affecting U.S. persons, corporate entities, international organizations, and their respective employees located around the world, based on their strategic interest to the Russian government. The Dutch government said Thursday that it blocked a cyberattack by Russian intelligence agents in April targeting the global chemical weapons watchdog agency.

{"pred": " \nA new study by Pecan Street Research Institute suggests that solar panels facing west may be more effective than those facing south in generating electricity, especially during peak demand periods. The study analyzed 50 homes in Austin, Texas and found that west-facing solar systems reduced the amount of electricity that homeowners needed to draw from the grid during summer peak demand by 65%, compared to 54% for south-facing panels. This is because west-oriented panels capture solar energy late in the afternoon, when most people get home from work and turn on their air conditioning, optimizing their solar power generation at precisely the time that their own usage surges. The study's findings could have widespread efficiency implications beyond single homes, and may prompt utility companies to rethink their opposition to west-facing panels. While the study is not definitive, it raises an important point about testing solar panel performance in practice instead of just assuming that angling south is always the best approach. The study's results are consistent with a previous California Public Utility Commission study that found west-facing systems were \"significantly better\" at offsetting peak load than south-facing ones. The findings of the study may motivate both consumers and utilities to fine-tune their use of solar installations, and could lead to more efficient use of solar energy. However, the benefits of tinkering with solar panel orientation may vary depending on the region, and the structure of incentives provided by utility companies also plays a role in how consumers choose to orient their panels.

The virus is spread through direct contact with infected blood, tissues, or bodily fluids, and can also be transmitted through contact with infected animals, such as fruit bats. The symptoms of Marburg hemorrhagic fever include fever, chills, headache, and myalgia, followed by a maculopapular rash, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, and diarrhea. The case-fatality rate for Marburg hemorrhagic fever is between 23-90%, making it a highly deadly disease.

Their joint investigation found an elevated death and complication count for heart transplant patients there, whose one-year survival rate \"now ranks near the bottom nationally\" at 85% for those who got a new heart between mid-2014 and 2016; the national rate was 91.4%. Hixenbaugh and Ornstein add a face to those stats via the story of James \"Lee\" Lewis. Word came on Jan. 1, 2018, that St. Luke's had a heart for Lewis—news that brought hope the 52-year-old would be able to walk his daughter down the aisle in June. But by March 23, he was dead, having never left the hospital. What happened in between is a series of missteps, starting with the Jan. 2 transplant. Two months after the transplant his family learned what went wrong that day: The defibrillator Dr. Masahiro Ono tried to use to \"jolt the new heart into rhythm\" wasn't working; he said he had to pump it by hand for 10 minutes until a working one was found. The donor heart was damaged and weakened as a result and wouldn't strengthen; it was eventually swapped for an artificial heart.

The Ministry of Health wants New Zealand to be smoke-free by 2025 and is exploring various pricing scenarios to achieve this goal. A document released under the Official Information Act suggests that a 10% increase on a pack of 20 cigarettes year-on-year from 2013 to 2025 could lead to a packet costing $40 by 2024, while a second scenario would see packs at $100 each by 2020.

The church's drive to open its vaults and clarify sensitive tenets is aimed at filling a void on the Internet for accurate information as curiosity increased while church membership tripled to 15 million over the past three decades. The Book of Mormon was translated by Joseph Smith, who claimed that he translated the book by the gift and power of God. The translation process was a \"development\" with multiple \"different phases\" in which Joseph \"grew and developed and better understood his role.\" Joseph used physical instruments, including the Urim and Thummim and a seer stone, to aid in the translation process. The original Book of Mormon manuscript, 28 percent of which has survived through the years, also supports statements that Joseph dictated the text from another language in a short period of time. The manuscript includes errors that suggest the scribe heard words incorrectly rather than misread words copied from another manuscript, and some grammatical constructions that are more characteristic of Near Eastern languages than English appear in the original manuscript.

{"pred": " \nA new study by Pecan Street Research Institute suggests that solar panels facing west may generate more electricity than those facing south, especially during peak demand hours. The study analyzed 50 homes in Austin, Texas, and found that west-facing solar systems reduced the amount of electricity that homeowners needed to draw from the grid during summer peak demand by 65 percent, compared to 54 percent for south-facing panels. This is because west-oriented panels capture solar energy late in the afternoon, when most people get home from work and turn on their air conditioning, and when the utility company needs the most help coping with demand. The study's findings could change the residential solar market, making west-facing solar panels a more viable option for homeowners, especially those with east-west roof pitches. Utility companies may need to rethink their opposition to west-facing panels, as they can help reduce stress on the grid during peak demand periods. A California Public Utility Commission study published in 2011 also found that west-facing systems were more effective at offsetting peak load than south-facing ones, even though they had lower annual energy yields. The study's results are not surprising, but the more precise quantification of the benefits of west-facing panels could motivate consumers and utilities to fine-tune their use of solar installations. However, the benefits of west-facing panels may vary depending on the region, and no single prescription fits all places. The structure of incentives provided by utility companies also plays a role in how consumers choose to orient their panels. Overall, the study's findings highlight the potential for west-facing solar panels to reduce peak demand and stress on the grid, and could lead to a shift in the way solar panels are installed and used.  The study's results are significant because they challenge the conventional wisdom that solar panels should always face south to generate the most energy. The study's findings could have a major impact on the residential solar market, making west-facing solar panels a more viable option for homeowners. The study's results also highlight the importance of considering the specific needs and conditions of different regions when designing and installing solar panels.  The study's findings are also relevant to the broader discussion of how to manage peak demand and reduce stress on the grid. The study's results suggest that west-facing solar panels could be an effective tool for reducing peak demand and stress on the grid, and could be used in conjunction with other strategies to achieve this goal. Overall, the study's findings are significant and have important implications for the residential solar market and the broader discussion of how to manage peak demand and reduce stress", "answers": ["If you happen to have solar panels on your house, they might need a change of direction.

{"pred": " \nThe recent tragedy on Mount Everest, where 16 Sherpas were killed in an avalanche, has highlighted the risks faced by these high-altitude climbing guides. According to a study, the fatality rate for Sherpas on Everest is 12 times higher than that of US military personnel in Iraq from 2003-2007. The study also found that the fatality rate for Sherpas has increased significantly since 2000, with 21 Sherpas dying on the mountain between 2004-2014. The main reasons for this high risk are the Sherpas' lack of access to bottled oxygen, their better acclimatization to high altitudes, and their responsibility for carrying heavy loads and installing ropes on the mountain. The study also notes that the warming of the Himalayan climate has made the Khumbu Icefall more unstable, increasing the risk of accidents. In response to the tragedy, the Sherpas have announced a strike, demanding better compensation for their families, increased insurance benefits, and a permanent relief fund. The Nepali government has offered a paltry compensation of $400 to the families of the deceased Sherpas, sparking outrage among the Sherpas. The strike has put the entire climbing season on hold, with many expeditions already announcing their withdrawal from the mountain. The tragedy has also highlighted the commercialization of climbing on Everest, with many Western climbers using bottled oxygen and other safety measures, while the Sherpas are left to bear the risks. The study concludes that the risks faced by Sherpas on Everest are not only due to the physical dangers of the mountain but also due to the economic and social inequalities faced by these guides. The Nepali government's response to the tragedy has been criticized for being inadequate, and the Sherpas' demands for better compensation and working conditions are seen as a necessary step towards addressing the systemic issues faced by these guides. The tragedy has also sparked a wider debate about the ethics of commercial climbing on Everest and the treatment of Sherpas as a workforce.

His piece makes plain the imbalance between the dangers faced by Sherpas and the climbers they shepherd to the mountain's peak, but before arriving at that point, he shares a fascinating backstory: That of Himex, a New Zealand-based company that Krakauer calls the most \"lucrative commercial guiding operation\" on Everest—one that on May 7, 2012, packed up shop after 18 years on the mountain and headed home, taking its guides, members (aka paying climbers, who didn't see their $60,000 refunded), and Sherpas with them. The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route. As Krakauer writes, the \"wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion\" that broke free and caused last week's avalanche came from \"that same ice bulge\" and killed 16 Sherpas. As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60. Among the reasons it's gotten safer: Climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen, and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet, which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain).

Beeker argues that the Santa Maria could not have drifted onto what is now land due to shallow and dangerous reefs, and that the bronze fasteners found on the site are not sufficient reason to dismiss the site without detailed investigation. The controversy highlights the challenges of underwater archaeology and the need for thorough and comprehensive investigations to resolve the debate over the Santa Maria's final resting place.  The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has made progress in addressing the challenges in the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) program, including improving data sharing among agencies and with states, and enhancing its risk assessment approach to incorporate all elements of risk. DHS has also taken action to strengthen the accuracy of data it uses to identify high-risk facilities, and has implemented an Expedited Approval Program (EAP) to reduce the regulatory burden on smaller chemical companies. However, the EAP has seen low participation, with only 18 of the 3,152 eligible facilities opting to use it, and recent changes to the CFATS program may affect the future use of the EAP.

As predicted by authorities in Haiti, UNESCO experts say there is \"indisputable proof\" that the wreck found off the country's north coast is from a much later period than 1492, reports the BBC. UNESCO says the wreck is further from shore than accounts of Columbus' first voyage, and bronze or copper fasteners found at the site are evidence of shipbuilding techniques that date the ship to the late 17th or 18th century at the earliest. UNESCO says it believes the wreck may lie \"under coastal sediment\" in what is now marshland and has called for further investigation of the area. Marine archaeologist Barry Clifford, who first investigated the wreck 11 years ago, says Columbus-era lombard cannons spotted in the area are crucial pieces of evidence that now appear to have been looted from the site, the Independent reports. \"The lombards are the smoking guns and, in my view, the most important pieces of evidence in the search for the Santa Maria,\" he says.

This behavior, according to Clemmons, is a form of gaslighting that uses sarcasm as a cover. The controversy began when Dunham and her co-worker Jenni Konner issued a statement in support of Murray Miller, a writer and executive producer of the TV show Girls, who was accused of sexual assault by actress Aurora Perrineau.

According to an investigation by ProPublica and the Houston Chronicle, the program has performed an outsized number of heart transplants resulting in deaths or unusual complications, has lost several top physicians, and has scaled back its ambition for treating high-risk patients. The program's survival rate has declined, with only 85% of patients surviving at least one year after transplant, compared to 91.4% nationally. The hospital has been cited by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for its poor outcomes and has submitted a plan of correction to avoid losing federal funds. The investigation reveals that the program's troubles began after a series of changes, including the departure of several experienced physicians and the acquisition of the hospital by a new owner. The program's current surgical director, Dr. Jeffrey Morgan, has been named in two malpractice lawsuits in Michigan and has been accused of making surgical errors, including stitching through a major vein during a transplant. The hospital has defended its program, citing improved survival rates since Morgan's arrival and the challenges of treating high-risk patients. However, the investigation raises concerns about the program's ability to provide high-quality care and its marketing of itself as a national leader in heart transplants. The story of James \"Lee\" Lewis, a patient who received a heart transplant at Baylor St. Luke's but suffered severe complications and ultimately died, highlights the program's struggles and the need for greater transparency and accountability. The investigation also reveals that the hospital withheld key details about Lewis's care, including what went wrong in the operating room during his transplant, and that the hospital's risk management department and cardiologist met with Lewis's wife to discuss the complications, but the hospital's statement to reporters contradicted the surgeon's account of the events. The investigation raises questions about the hospital's handling of patient care and its commitment to transparency and accountability. The story of Lee Lewis and his family's experience at Baylor St. Luke's highlights the human cost of the program's struggles and the need for greater oversight and accountability in the medical industry.

The charges center around allegations that they altered or concealed alarming reports showing high levels of toxic lead in Flint's water and the bloodstreams of the city's children. The investigation found that the employees, including the woman in charge of drinking water quality, Liane Shekter-Smith, took steps to mislead the public and conceal evidence, ignoring reports that the water plant was out of compliance. The employees allegedly manipulated data, advised others not to report problems, and covered up warning signs of lead poisoning. The investigation is ongoing, and additional charges could be forthcoming. The crisis began in 2014 when the state switched Flint's water supply from Lake Huron to the Flint River, a tributary notorious for its filth. The Department of Environmental Quality failed to treat the corrosive water, which ate into the city's iron and lead pipes, causing lead to leach into the drinking water. The city switched back to the Lake Huron water supply in October, but the water is still not safe to drink or cook with from the tap. The crisis has drawn national attention, and there's plenty of blame to go around. The state has made the decision to switch the water source, but some lawsuits accuse the city of being complicit by not doing enough during the 18 months that residents received their drinking water from the Flint River. The state has filed a civil lawsuit against two companies that were assisting Flint with its water treatment process, accusing them of professional negligence, public nuisance, and fraud. The crisis has also led to the replacement of pipes at 1,492 homes through Flint Mayor Karen Weaver's FAST Start Initiative.

The disease has a high mortality rate, ranging from 23% to 90%, and is spread through direct contact with infected blood, tissues, or bodily fluids. The virus was first identified in 1967 in Germany and Yugoslavia after laboratory workers handled African green monkeys imported from Uganda. Since then, there have been sporadic outbreaks, with a dozen recorded cases, often involving a single patient. The most recent outbreak in Uganda in 2012 killed four out of 15 patients. The disease causes symptoms similar to Ebola, including fever, weakness, and internal or external bleeding, and can lead to organ failure and death. In the current outbreak in Uganda, a 30-year-old male health worker died of Marburg, and 99 people have been quarantined, with at least 11 testing negative. The Ugandan government has put in place rigorous surveillance and disease control measures, and the World Health Organization has been informed. The Marburg virus is not airborne and is spread through direct contact, making it easier to contain than Ebola. The Ugandan government has experience and adequate capacity to deal with the disease, and the World Health Organization has praised their efforts in containing the outbreak. President Museveni of Uganda has also emphasized the need to improve the equipment of the Army, re-launch the country's Airline, and increase funds for Operation Wealth Creation to support youth and women's projects. He has also called for a movement of import substitution and export promotion to create jobs and reduce foreign travels. The Minister of State for the Youth, Hon.

Brown and his team have found evidence of a giant icy planet, which they call \"Planet Nine,\" that is thought to be five to 10 times the mass of Earth and orbits the sun at an average distance of 20 times that of Neptune. The existence of Planet Nine is supported by the motion of recently discovered dwarf planets and other small objects in the outer solar system, which appear to be influenced by the gravity of a hidden planet. While some scientists are skeptical, Brown believes that the evidence is strong and that the planet may be discovered within the next few years. The discovery of Planet Nine would reconfigure the models of the solar system and could potentially lead to a reclassification of Pluto. Brown's research has sparked a new era of exploration and discovery in the field of astronomy, and he is optimistic that the discovery of Planet Nine will be a major breakthrough. The search for Planet Nine is ongoing, with telescopes on at least two continents searching for the object. While the discovery of Planet Nine is still a topic of debate, the research has sparked a renewed interest in the study of the outer solar system and the possibility of discovering new planets.

The prosecution argues that Rayhons took advantage of his wife's mental incapacity to consent to sex, while Rayhons claims that their relationship was loving and consensual. The case raises complex questions about the nature of consent and the rights of individuals with dementia to engage in sexual activity. Experts argue that intimacy can be beneficial for people with dementia, but that it is essential to consider their capacity to make decisions about sex. The prosecution's case relies on evidence that Donna was unable to recall words and had difficulty with daily tasks, but Rayhons' defense argues that this does not necessarily mean she was unable to consent to sex. The case highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of consent and the rights of individuals with dementia. In a related discussion, the author argues that the law should consider the nature of the parties' past relationship when determining whether sex is consensual, and that spouses should be treated differently from others in this regard. The author also suggests that the law should not criminalize sex among lovers who are not mentally competent, but rather consider the context and the parties' past practice. The author notes that Iowa law takes this into account to some extent, but not sufficiently, and that the law should be crafted to preclude prosecution in cases where the parties have a long-term loving relationship.

The case revolves around the shooting death of Reeva Steenkamp, Pistorius's girlfriend, who was found shot in the bathroom of Pistorius's home. The prosecution argues that Pistorius intentionally murdered Steenkamp, while the defense claims that he mistook her for a burglar and acted in self-defense. The case has raised questions about Pistorius's character and behavior, with some witnesses and acquaintances describing him as aggressive and entitled. Key evidence presented in the case includes the location of the bullet holes in the bathroom door, the placement of the bullet casings, and the testimony of Detective Hilton Botha, who initially investigated the case. Botha's credibility has been questioned due to his own involvement in a separate attempted murder case. The trial has also highlighted the high crime rate in South Africa and the prevalence of femicide, with Steenkamp's death being one of many reported cases of intimate femicide in the country. The case has sparked a national conversation about violence against women and the need for greater awareness and action to prevent such crimes. The prosecution's case relies heavily on the testimony of Botha and other witnesses, while the defense has presented evidence that suggests Pistorius may have genuinely believed Steenkamp was a burglar. The trial has been marked by controversy and drama, with Pistorius's bail being granted and later appealed.

Pistorius in particular comes off as an egomaniac with long-standing anger issues. \"When Pistorius competed at the London Olympics, last summer, (a radio host) interviewed the athlete’s roommate at the Olympic Village: ‘What is it like to sleep in the same room with a superstar?’ And he said, ‘I moved out. Oscar is always shouting at people on the phone.’\" A \"former confidant\" tells Seal that the Olympics changed Pistorius for the worse. “He was bragging about his adventures in the good life. He was like, ‘I’m the man, I’m Oscar. The world owes me.’ That sense of entitlement. He wasn’t like that; he was made into that.\" In subsequent training sessions at a gym, his “swearing would astonish the mothers and children also using the gym,\" says a reporter. “He would storm out of the gym midway through a workout.

Ravitch's decision was based on a 52-page summary of her findings, which included new details about the shooting, such as Lopez's likely high state of marijuana intoxication at the time of the shooting. The report found that Gelhaus believed Lopez was carrying a real assault rifle and that his response, including the number of shots he fired, was reasonable. However, protesters and activists denounced Ravitch's decision, calling it an injustice and a consequence of the wider militarization of police departments. They argued that Lopez was a boy with a toy gun who did not pose a threat to anyone, and that Gelhaus's actions were a result of a culture of fear and aggression within law enforcement. The community was left reeling from the decision, with many calling for Gelhaus to be held accountable for his actions. The incident highlighted the need for greater transparency and accountability within law enforcement, as well as the importance of addressing the root causes of police brutality and violence. The decision also sparked calls for legislation requiring imitation firearms to be made of brightly colored or translucent materials, in order to prevent similar incidents in the future.

According to Jennifer Allyn, a managing director at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, girls need to be taken to the C-suite, where corporate chiefs work, to understand the specific requirements and rewards of leadership. This can be achieved by introducing girls to female role models, explaining what leaders do on a day-to-day basis, and supporting programs that actively identify and groom female talent. A recent study by the Girl Scouts found that 80% of girls want to interact with successful women, but 60% have not been offered the opportunity to see them in action. Companies can help by using the day to introduce their employees' daughters to women at the highest level of the company and highlighting their accomplishments. This can help close the gap between girls' aspirations and their perceptions of leadership.

The study, which analyzed data from over 30,000 twins, found that the older the father, the higher the score. The researchers suggest that this may be due to the fact that older fathers are more likely to have higher levels of education and career success, which are associated with geeky traits. The study also found that children with a high geek index score tend to perform better in school, particularly in STEM subjects. However, the researchers note that the effect of paternal age on geekiness is stronger in boys than girls, and that the study does not suggest that men should delay fatherhood in order to have more intelligent sons. The study's findings are based on data from the Twin Early Development Study (TEDS), which collected cognitive and behavioral data on 15,000 sets of twins at the age of 12. The researchers used a \"geek index\" score, which combines measures of non-verbal IQ, focus on subjects of interest, and social aloofness, to assess the level of geekiness in each child. The study's findings suggest that there may be a genetic component to geekiness, with 57% of the geek index score being inherited. The researchers also note that there may be some overlap between genes that contribute to geekiness and those that contribute to autism, and that children with a high geek index score may be at a higher risk of autism if they inherit more of these genes. Overall, the study provides new insights into the relationship between paternal age and geekiness, and highlights the importance of considering the potential benefits of delayed fatherhood.

The latter trait may sound like a negative, but the BBC frames it as the boys not being overly concerned with fitting in. A mother's age appears to have no impact. The team studied more than 7,000 sets of twins in the UK. The average geek score for boys born to dads 25 or younger is 39. It goes up to 41 when dads had the child between 35 and 44, and jumps to 47 when dads were 50 or older. The impact was less pronounced on girls, and more pronounced when measuring science, tech, engineering, and math scores.

However, research has revealed a paradoxical trade-off: the AFPs not only prevent the fish's blood from freezing but also inhibit the melting of ice crystals in their bodies. This means that the fish may accumulate ice crystals in their veins, which could be detrimental to their health. Scientists have discovered that the AFPs bind to ice crystals and alter their surface, making it difficult for them to grow or melt. This phenomenon, known as \"superheating,\" has been observed in the fish's bodies, where ice crystals persist even at temperatures above the expected melting point. The study suggests that the fish may have evolved mechanisms to clear the ice from their circulation, but the long-term consequences of this accumulation are still unknown. The research highlights the complex and often counterintuitive nature of evolutionary adaptations, where seemingly beneficial traits can have unintended consequences. The findings have implications for our understanding of the evolution of antifreeze proteins and the survival strategies of Antarctic notothenioid fishes.

The study found that approximately 47 million unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions are issued annually, with 30% of outpatient oral antibiotic prescriptions being inappropriate. The majority of these prescriptions are for acute respiratory conditions such as colds, sore throats, bronchitis, flu, and other viral illnesses that do not respond to antibiotics. The study suggests that reducing inappropriate antibiotic use by 15% would meet the goal of reducing outpatient antibiotic use by 50% by 2020. The CDC has warned that antibiotic overprescribing contributes to drug resistance, and failure to curb this practice could have grim consequences, including 2 million individuals being infected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria each year and 23,000 deaths annually. The study highlights the importance of antibiotic stewardship and the need for health professionals to only prescribe antibiotics when necessary and to select the right antibiotic at the right dose for the right duration. The study also emphasizes the role of pharmacists in educating patients about the potential consequences of unnecessary antibiotic use. The CDC has been working to combat antibiotic resistance, and an updated report on antibiotic-resistant threats is expected to be released in fall 2019.

And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts—the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post—isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal.

According to Passage 2, Trump has denied allegations made about him in an unverified dossier prepared by ex-British intelligence officer Christopher Steele. The dossier, which was published on Tuesday, contains unverified allegations about Trump's activities and connections in Russia. Passage 3 provides more information about Steele, who is a director of London-based Orbis Business Intelligence Ltd. and has a long history of dealing with the shadow world of Moscow's spooks and siloviki. Steele prepared the dossier under contract to both Republican and Democratic opponents of Trump. Passage 4 discusses how Democrats are struggling with how far to go in exploiting Trump's Russia troubles for political gain, while Passage 5 provides a detailed account of how the dossier was compiled and how it was leaked to the press. Passage 6 argues that the intelligence community's decision to brief Trump and Obama about the dossier's allegations was a mistake, and that the allegations are unverified and unvetted. Passage 7 provides more information about Steele and his work on the dossier, and Passage 9 condemns Trump for trivializing the Holocaust to score a political point.

The woman, Judy Huth, claims Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her at the Playboy Mansion in the mid-1970s. Cosby's lawyer, Martin Singer, is seeking to dismiss Huth's suit and has called it an extortion attempt. However, a clinical psychologist who interviewed Huth stated there is \"a reasonable basis to believe that Ms. Huth has been subject to childhood sexual abuse.\" Los Angeles police are investigating Huth's claims. Meanwhile, another woman, Chloe Goins, has come forward with allegations that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her at the Playboy Mansion in 2008, when she was 18 years old. Goins plans to make a full statement to Los Angeles police. The allegations against Cosby have sparked an investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department, and more than 20 women have publicly claimed the comedian drugged and/or sexually assaulted them over a period spanning several decades. Cosby's lawyer has denied the women's claims and questioned their credibility. Cosby has remained mostly silent about the allegations, though he commented in an interview that the \"black media\" should remain \"neutral\" on the charges against him. His wife, Camille, has issued a statement defending her husband as \"the man you thought you knew.\" The allegations against Cosby have raised questions about his character and behavior, and the investigation is ongoing. The key evidence presented includes the testimony of witnesses who corroborate Huth's story, as well as Goins' allegations of being drugged and assaulted by Cosby. The unique point made in the passages is the sheer number of women who have come forward with allegations against Cosby, highlighting the scope and severity of the allegations. The main argument of the passages is that Cosby's behavior has been predatory and abusive, and that he has used his power and influence to silence his victims. The supporting data presented includes the testimony of witnesses, the allegations of multiple women, and the investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department. The innovative point made in the passages is the use of social media and the media to bring attention to the allegations against Cosby and to support the victims.

The event, which now includes boys, is still valuable, but the problems facing girls and women have changed. The main argument is that girls no longer need help picturing themselves in a job, but rather need encouragement to become leaders. The key evidence presented is that women make up only 3.6% of CEOs, 14% of executive officers, and 16% of board directors in Fortune 500 companies. The author suggests that companies can help close the gap by introducing girls to female role models, explaining what leadership is like on a day-to-day basis, and supporting programs that actively identify and groom female talent. The author also highlights the importance of sponsorship, where influential people provide opportunities and support to help girls become leaders. The main conclusion is that simply showing girls what an office looks like is no longer enough, and real breakthroughs will come when girls are brought inside the halls of power.

The concert was reportedly paid for by the President, with West earning millions of dollars for his performance. This event has raised questions about the wealth and influence of President Nazarbayev, who is considered by some to be an ardent dictator. In contrast, the US government has rules in place to separate policy and funding decisions, as seen in the Holman rule, which prohibits legislation from being included in appropriation bills unless it reduces expenditures. The rule has undergone several changes over the years, with the current version allowing for retrenchments that reduce the number and salary of federal officials or the compensation of any person paid out of the Treasury. The SPR, a strategic petroleum reserve, has been used to mitigate the effects of supply disruptions, but its size and configuration have been subject to congressional direction and changing market conditions. The reserve has been used to respond to domestic supply disruptions, but its limitations have been highlighted, and additional regional product reserves have been recommended. The US government has not fully examined the costs and benefits of regional petroleum product reserves, and the SPR's modernization plans have been complicated by uncertainty regarding its long-term size and configuration.

The crisis was caused by the city's decision to switch its water source from Lake Huron to the Flint River, which was not properly treated, leading to high levels of lead in the water. The crisis resulted in widespread contamination of the city's water supply, affecting thousands of residents, particularly children, who were exposed to lead through drinking water. The crisis was exacerbated by the actions of state and local officials, who allegedly altered or concealed reports showing high levels of lead in the water and the bloodstreams of children. The investigation into the crisis has led to the charging of several state and local officials, including six current and former employees of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality and the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. The charges include misconduct in office, conspiracy, and willful neglect of duty. The investigation has also revealed that the crisis was caused by a combination of factors, including the failure of state and local officials to require corrosion control chemicals to be added to the water, and the failure of the city's water treatment plant to properly treat the water. The crisis has had significant consequences for the residents of Flint, including increased rates of lead poisoning, and has led to widespread criticism of the state and local officials responsible for the crisis. The investigation is ongoing, and additional charges are expected to be filed. The crisis has also led to a number of civil lawsuits, including a lawsuit filed by the state against two companies that were assisting Flint with its water treatment process. The lawsuit alleges that the companies were negligent in their work and failed to properly treat the water.

{"pred": " \nA new study by Pecan Street Research Institute suggests that facing solar panels west instead of south could produce more electricity during peak demand hours. The study, which analyzed 50 homes in Austin, Texas, found that west-facing solar systems reduced the amount of electricity that homeowners needed to draw from the grid during summer peak demand by 65 percent, compared to 54 percent for south-facing panels. This is because west-oriented panels are more effective at capturing solar energy late in the afternoon, when most people get home from work and turn on their air conditioning in the summer. The study's findings could have widespread efficiency implications beyond single homes, and may prompt utility companies to rethink their opposition to west-facing panels. While conventional wisdom suggests that solar panels should be angled within 30 degrees of true south to generate the most energy, the study's results suggest that this may not always be the case. The study's findings are consistent with a previous study published in 2011, which also found that west-facing systems were more effective at offsetting peak load than south-facing ones. The study's results may motivate both consumers and utilities to fine-tune their use of solar installations, and could lead to more efficient use of solar energy. The study's findings are not a surprise, but the more precise quantification of the benefits of west-facing panels may be a game-changer for the solar industry. The structure of incentives provided by utility companies also plays a role in how consumers choose to orient their panels, and may influence the adoption of west-facing panels. Overall, the study's findings suggest that west-facing solar panels may be a more effective way to generate electricity during peak demand hours, and could lead to more efficient use of solar energy.  The study's results may also have implications for the design of solar panels and the way they are installed, and could lead to more innovative and efficient designs.  The study's findings are a reminder that conventional wisdom may not always be the best approach, and that more research and experimentation are needed to optimize the use of solar energy.  The study's results are a step in the right direction towards a more efficient and sustainable energy future.  The study's findings are also a reminder that the solar industry is constantly evolving and improving, and that new technologies and designs are being developed all the time.

He clashed with the existing writers, who were resistant to change, but eventually, he was able to bring in new talent, including Ben Karlin and David Javerbaum, who shared his vision. The show's correspondents, including Stephen Colbert and Steve Carell, also played a crucial role in shaping the show's tone and style. The show's success was marked by its ability to tackle complex issues in a humorous and irreverent way, and its willingness to challenge the status quo. The show's impact was also evident in its ability to influence the media and politics, with politicians and journalists taking notice of its biting commentary. The show's success was also marked by its ability to adapt to changing times, with the rise of the internet and social media. The show's legacy continues to be felt today, with many considering it a pioneering force in the world of satire and comedy. \n\nIn a separate segment, Steve Carell, a correspondent on The Daily Show, asked a question to Senator John McCain during a campaign event in 1999, which was a turning point for the show.
