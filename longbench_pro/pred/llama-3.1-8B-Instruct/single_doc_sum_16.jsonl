{"pred": " \nThe Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA) is a federal workers' compensation program that provides medical and disability benefits to longshore and harbor workers who are injured or become ill on the job. The program is administered by the Department of Labor (DOL) and is funded through an annual assessment charged to employers and insurance carriers. In 2016, the LHWCA paid approximately $1.41 billion in cash and medical benefits to injured workers and the families of deceased workers. The program provides medical benefits to fully cover the cost of any medical treatment associated with a covered injury or illness, and disability benefits to partially cover wages lost due to covered injuries or illnesses. The LHWCA also provides survivors benefits to the families of workers who die on the job. The program has been amended several times to extend coverage to occupations outside the original scope of the law, and employers required by the LHWCA to provide workers' compensation coverage may either purchase private insurance or self-insure. The DOL operates the Special Fund to provide LHWCA benefits in cases in which the responsible employer or insurance carrier cannot pay or in which benefits must be paid for a second injury under Section 8(f) of the LHWCA. The administrative costs associated with the LHWCA are largely provided by general revenue. The LHWCA provides a schedule of benefits to be paid in cases of permanent partial disability (PPD), and benefits in cases not listed on the schedule are paid at two-thirds of the difference between the pre-injury wage and current earning capacity for the duration of the disability. The program also provides cash benefits to the surviving spouses and minor children of workers killed on the job. The LHWCA has been amended several times to extend coverage to occupations outside the original scope of the law, and the program has been modified to include additional exclusions for persons who work on recreational vessels over 65 feet in length. The DOL is responsible for authorizing insurance carriers to provide coverage under the LHWCA program and for authorizing companies to self-insure, but the DOL does not set or regulate insurance premiums. The LHWCA is a no-fault system that pays workers for employment-related injuries or illnesses without considering the culpability of any one party.

Firms that employ these workers are required to purchase workers' compensation or self-insure and are responsible for providing medical and disability benefits to covered workers who are injured or become ill on the job and survivors benefits to the families of covered workers who die on the job. The LHWCA is administered by the Department of Labor (DOL), and all benefit costs are paid by employers and their insurance carriers. In 2016, more than $1.4 billion in LHWCA benefits were paid to beneficiaries. Congress has extended the LHWCA provisions to cover workers outside of the maritime industry, such as overseas government contractors and civilian employees of military post exchanges. As part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), persons who repair recreational vessels of any size were added to the LHWCA exemption list. In 2011, the DOL implemented this provision; since then, those regulations have proven controversial and numerous bills have been introduced to modify the regulatory definition to increase the number of workers exempted from the LHWCA. The LHWCA pays for all medical care associated with a covered injury or illness.

According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), between fiscal year 2008 and 2018, attack submarines incurred 10,363 days of idle time and maintenance delays, with 82% of these delays attributed to depot maintenance. The GAO estimated that the Navy spent over $1.5 billion in fiscal year 2018 constant dollars on attack submarines sitting idle while waiting to enter the shipyards, and on those delayed in completing their maintenance at the shipyards. The Navy has started to address workforce shortages and facilities needs at the public shipyards, but these efforts will require several years of sustained management attention to reach fruition. The GAO recommended that the Secretary of the Navy ensure that the Chief of Naval Operations conducts a business case analysis to inform maintenance workload allocation across public and private shipyards, and to proactively minimize attack submarine idle time and maintenance delays. The Navy has acknowledged the need to be more proactive in leveraging private shipyard repair capacity, but officials cautioned that maintenance could cost more at a private shipyard than at a public shipyard. The GAO's findings highlight the need for the Navy to take additional steps to maximize attack submarine readiness and address challenges such as the allocation of maintenance periods between public and private shipyards. Without addressing this challenge, the Navy will not achieve the full benefit of the nation's investment in its attack submarines, and it risks continued expenditure of operating and support funding to crew, maintain, and support attack submarines that provide no operational capability because they are delayed in getting into and out of maintenance. The Navy's attack submarine fleet is critical to the nation's defense, and the persistent maintenance delays and idle time are a significant concern that requires immediate attention.

These capabilities make attack submarines some of the most–requested assets by the global combatant commanders. GAO was asked to review the readiness of the Navy's attack submarine force. This report discusses the extent to which the Navy (1) has experienced maintenance delays in its attack submarine fleet and costs associated with any delays; and (2) has addressed any challenges and developed mitigation plans for any maintenance delays. GAO analyzed readiness information from fiscal years 2008-2018, operating and support costs, maintenance performance, and other data; visited attack submarines and squadrons; and interviewed public and private shipyard and fleet officials. This is a public version of a classified report issued in October 2018. Information the Department of Defense deemed classified or sensitive, such as attack submarine force structure requirements and detailed data on attack submarine maintenance delays, has been omitted. The Navy has been unable to begin or complete the vast majority of its attack submarine maintenance periods on time resulting in significant maintenance delays and operating and support cost expenditures. GAO's analysis of Navy maintenance data shows that between fiscal year 2008 and 2018, attack submarines have incurred 10,363 days of idle time and maintenance delays as a result of delays in getting into and out of the shipyards. For example, the Navy originally scheduled the USS Boise to enter a shipyard for an extended maintenance period in 2013 but, due to heavy shipyard workload, the Navy delayed the start of the maintenance period. In June 2016, the USS Boise could no longer conduct normal operations and the boat has remained idle, pierside for over two years since then waiting to enter a shipyard (see figure). GAO estimated that since fiscal year 2008 the Navy has spent more than $1.5 billion in fiscal year 2018 constant dollars to support attack submarines that provide no operational capability—those sitting idle while waiting to enter the shipyards, and those delayed in completing their maintenance at the shipyards. The Navy has started to address challenges related to workforce shortages and facilities needs at the public shipyards. However, it has not effectively allocated maintenance periods among public shipyards and private shipyards that may also be available to help minimize attack submarine idle time. GAO's analysis found that while the public shipyards have operated above capacity for the past several years, attack submarine maintenance delays are getting longer and idle time is increasing. The Navy may have options to mitigate this idle time and maintenance delays by leveraging private shipyard capacity for repair work. But the Navy has not completed a comprehensive business case analysis as recommended by Department of Defense guidelines to inform maintenance workload allocation across public and private shipyards. Navy leadership has acknowledged that they need to be more proactive in leveraging potential private shipyard repair capacity. Without addressing this challenge, the Navy risks continued expenditure of operating and support funding to crew, maintain, and support attack submarines that provide no operational capability because they are delayed in getting into and out of maintenance.

{"pred": " Passage 1\nThe Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) requires lobbyists to register and file quarterly reports disclosing their lobbying activities. The LDA defines a lobbyist as an individual who makes more than one lobbying contact on behalf of a client and whose lobbying activities represent at least 20% of their time spent on behalf of the client. Lobbyists are required to file an LD-1 form within 45 days of being employed or retained to make a lobbying contact and quarterly LD-2 reports detailing their lobbying activities. The LDA also requires lobbyists to report certain political contributions semiannually in the LD-203 report. Our review found that most lobbyists reported $5,000 or more in income or expenses provided written documentation to varying degrees for the reporting elements in their disclosure reports. However, we estimate that 25% of reports did not round reported income or expenses according to the guidance. We also found that lobbyists for an estimated 93% of LD-2 reports filed year-end 2016 listed political contributions on the report as required. The U.S. Attorney's Office (USAO) is responsible for ensuring LDA compliance and has the authority to impose civil or criminal penalties for noncompliance. USAO received 3,213 referrals from the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House for failure to comply with LD-2 reporting requirements from 2009 to 2015. About 45% of the referrals are now compliant, and about 55% are pending further action. We also found that lobbyists and lobbying firms who repeatedly fail to file reports are labeled chronic offenders and referred to one of the assigned attorneys for follow-up. USAO officials reported that they will continue to monitor and investigate chronic offenders to determine the appropriate enforcement actions. Overall, our review found that while some lobbyists and lobbying firms are not complying with the LDA, the USAO is taking steps to enforce compliance and bring noncompliant lobbyists into compliance. The GAO recommends that the USAO continue to monitor and enforce compliance with the LDA to ensure that lobbyists are transparent and accountable in their lobbying activities. The GAO also recommends that the USAO improve its tracking and reporting of compliance trends and referrals to better identify and address chronic offenders. The GAO will continue to monitor the USAO's efforts to enforce compliance with the LDA and provide recommendations for improvement.

This is GAO's 11th report under the provision. GAO reviewed a stratified random sample of 98 quarterly disclosure LD-2 reports filed for the third and fourth quarters of calendar year 2016 and the first and second quarters of calendar year 2017. GAO also reviewed two random samples totaling 160 LD-203 reports from year-end 2016 and midyear 2017. This methodology allowed GAO to generalize to the population of 45,818 disclosure reports with $5,000 or more in lobbying activity, and 30,594 reports of federal political campaign contributions. GAO also met with officials from USAO to obtain status updates on its efforts to focus resources on lobbyists who fail to comply. GAO is not making any recommendations in this report. GAO provided a draft of this report to the Department of Justice for review and comment. The Department of Justice provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. For the 2017 reporting period, most lobbyists provided documentation for key elements of their disclosure reports to demonstrate compliance with the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995, as amended (LDA). For lobbying disclosure (LD-2) reports and political contributions (LD-203) reports filed during the third and fourth quarter of 2016 and the first and second quarter of 2017, GAO estimates that 87 percent of lobbyists filed reports as required for the quarter in which they first registered; the figure below describes the filing process and enforcement; 99 percent of all lobbyists who filed (up from 83 percent in 2016) could provide documentation for income and expenses; and 93 percent filed year-end 2016 LD-203 reports as required. These findings are generally consistent with prior reports GAO issued for the 2010 through 2016 reporting periods. However, in recent years GAO's findings showed some variation in the estimated percentage of reports with supporting documentation. For example, an estimated increase in lobbyists who could document expenses is notable in 2017 and represents a statistically significant increase from 2016.

Rules for giving certain types of names to certain types of Navy ships have evolved over time. There have been exceptions to the Navy's ship-naming rules, particularly for the purpose of naming a ship for a person when the rule for that type of ship would have called for it to be named for something else. Some observers have perceived a breakdown in, or corruption of, the rules for naming Navy ships. On July 13, 2012, the Navy submitted to Congress a 73-page report on the Navy's policies and practices for naming ships. For ship types now being procured for the Navy, or recently procured for the Navy, naming rules can be summarized as follows: The first Ohio replacement ballistic missile submarine (SSBN-826) has been named Columbia in honor of the District of Columbia, but the Navy has not stated what the naming rule for these ships will be. Virginia (SSN-774) class attack submarines are being named for states. Aircraft carriers are generally named for past U.S. Presidents. Of the past 14, 10 were named for past U.S. Presidents, and 2 for Members of Congress. Destroyers are being named for deceased members of the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, including Secretaries of the Navy. The Navy has not yet announced a naming rule for its planned new class of FFG(X) frigates, the first of which the Navy wants to procure in FY2021. Previous classes of U.S. Navy frigates, like Navy destroyers, were generally named for naval leaders and heroes. Littoral Combat Ships (LCSs) are being named for regionally important U.S. cities and communities. Amphibious assault ships are being named for important battles in which U.S. Marines played a prominent part, and for famous earlier U.S. Navy ships that were not named for battles. San Antonio (LPD-17) class amphibious ships are being named for major U.S. cities and communities, and cities and communities attacked on September 11, 2001. John Lewis (TAO-205) class oilers are being named for people who fought for civil rights and human rights. Expeditionary Fast Transports (EPFs) are being named for small U.S. cities. Expeditionary Transport Docks (ESDs) and Expeditionary Sea Bases (ESBs) are being named for famous names or places of historical significance to U.S. Marines. Navajo (TATS-6) class towing, salvage, and rescue ships are being named for prominent Native Americans or Native American tribes. Since 1974, at least 21 U.S. military ships have been named for persons who were living at the time the name was announced. The most recent instance occurred on May 6, 2019, when the Navy announced that it was naming the destroyer DDG-51 for former Senator Sam Nunn. Members of the public are sometimes interested in having Navy ships named for their own states or cities, for older U.S. Navy ships (particularly those on which they or their relatives served), for battles in which they or their relatives participated, or for people they admire. Congress has long maintained an interest in how Navy ships are named, and has influenced the naming of certain Navy ships. The Navy suggests that congressional offices wishing to express support for proposals to name a Navy ship for a specific person, place, or thing contact the office of the Secretary of the Navy to make their support known.

{"pred": " Passage 1\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is responsible for ensuring that state-reported expenditures for Medicaid are supported and consistent with Medicaid requirements. To achieve this, CMS conducts quarterly reviews of state-reported expenditures, which involve reviewing state documentation, consulting with other CMS staff, and coordinating with states. The reviews also involve checking for errors and discrepancies in state-reported expenditures, and CMS has identified errors in three of the six states reviewed. Additionally, CMS conducts focused financial management reviews (FMRs) on high-risk areas, which involve a more in-depth examination of expenditures. FMRs have identified compliance issues in 11 of the 31 planned reviews, and CMS has issued disallowances for over $1 billion in expenditures. However, CMS has allocated similar staff resources to states with differing levels of risk, and has cancelled FMRs in 17 out of 51 instances due to resource constraints. Furthermore, CMS has not conducted a comprehensive, national risk assessment to determine whether resources for financial oversight activities are adequate and allocated based on areas of highest risk. This lack of risk assessment may result in CMS missing opportunities to better target resources to higher-risk expenditures and increase the savings from these oversight activities.

CMS is responsible for assuring that expenditures—reported quarterly by states—are consistent with Medicaid requirements and matched with the correct amount of federal funds. CMS's review of reported expenditures has become increasingly complex due to variation in states' Medicaid programs and an increasing number of different matching rates. GAO was asked to examine CMS's oversight of state-reported Medicaid expenditures. In this report, GAO examined how CMS assures that (1) expenditures are supported and consistent with requirements; and (2) the correct federal matching rates were applied to expenditures subject to a higher match. GAO also examined the financial impact of resolved errors. GAO reviewed documentation for the most recently completed quarterly reviews by 3 of CMS's 10 regional offices for six states that varied by Medicaid program expenditures and design. GAO also reviewed policies, procedures, and data on resolved errors; and interviewed CMS and state officials. GAO assessed CMS's oversight processes against federal standards for internal control. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), which oversees Medicaid, has various review processes in place to assure that expenditures reported by states are supported and consistent with Medicaid requirements. The agency also has processes to review that the correct federal matching rates were applied to expenditures receiving a higher than standard federal matching rate, which can include certain types of services and populations. These processes collectively have had a considerable federal financial benefit, with CMS resolving errors that reduced federal spending by over $5.1 billion in fiscal years 2014 through 2017. However, GAO identified weaknesses in how CMS targets its resources to address risks when reviewing whether expenditures are supported and consistent with requirements. CMS devotes similar levels of staff resources to review expenditures despite differing levels of risk across states. For example, the number of staff reviewing California's expenditures—which represent 15 percent of federal Medicaid spending—is similar to the number reviewing Arkansas' expenditures, which represents 1 percent of federal Medicaid spending. CMS cancelled in-depth financial management reviews in 17 out of 51 instances over the last 5 years. These reviews target expenditures considered by CMS to be at risk of not meeting program requirements. CMS told GAO that resource constraints contributed to both weaknesses. However, the agency has not completed a comprehensive assessment of risk to (1) determine whether oversight resources are adequate and (2) focus on the most significant areas of risk. Absent such an assessment, CMS is missing an opportunity to identify errors in reported expenditures that could result in substantial savings to the Medicaid program. GAO also found limitations in CMS's processes for reviewing expenditures that receive a higher federal matching rate. Internal guidance for examining variances in these expenditures was unclear, and not all reviewers in the three CMS regional offices GAO reviewed were investigating significant variances in quarter-to-quarter expenditures. Review procedures for expenditures for individuals newly eligible for Medicaid under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act were not tailored to different risk levels among states. For example, in its reviews of a sample of claims for this population, CMS reviewed claims for the same number of enrollees—30—in California as for Arkansas, even though California had 10 times the number of newly eligible enrollees as Arkansas. Without clear internal guidance and better targeting of risks in its review procedures for expenditures receiving higher matching rates, CMS may overpay states. GAO is making three recommendations, including that CMS improve its risk-based targeting of oversight efforts and resources, and clarify related internal guidance. The Department of Health and Human Services concurred with these recommendations."], "length": 12714}

The fund also receives mandatory appropriations under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (GOMESA). The level of annual appropriations for the LWCF has varied since the origin of the fund in FY1965. The LWCF Act outlines uses of the fund for federal and state purposes. Of the total made available through appropriations or deposits under GOMESA, not less than 40% is to be used for \"federal purposes\" and not less than 40% is to be used to provide \"financial assistance to states.\" The act lists the federal purposes for which the President is to allot LWCF funds \"unless otherwise allotted in the appropriation Act making them available.\" These purposes primarily relate to acquisition of lands and waters (and interests therein) by the federal government. With regard to state purposes, the act authorizes a matching grant program to states for outdoor recreation purposes. Throughout the LWCF's history, appropriations acts typically have provided funds for land acquisition and outdoor recreational grants to states. Beginning in FY1998, appropriations also have been provided each year (except FY1999) to fund other purposes related to natural resources. The extent to which the LWCF should be used for purposes other than federal land acquisition and outdoor recreation grants to states, and which other purposes should be funded from the LWCF, continue to be the subject of legislation and debate in Congress. In the past few decades, Presidents have sought LWCF funds for a variety of other purposes. Congress chooses which if any of these requests to fund, and has chosen programs not sought by the President for a particular year.

The RRA is mainly financed by payroll taxes, financial interchanges from Social Security, and transfers from the National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust (NRRIT). To be insured for railroad benefits, a worker must have at least 10 years of covered railroad work or 5 years performed after 1995 and \"insured status\" under Social Security rules. Railroad workers may qualify for daily unemployment and sickness benefits under the RUIA, which are paid in addition to any paid leave or private insurance an employee may have. The RUIA is financed solely by railroad employers' payroll taxes, based on the taxable earnings of their employees. The RRB determines whether a worker is disabled based on the medical evidence provided during the application process. Railroad workers found to be totally and permanently disabled from all work may be eligible for Tier I benefits at any age if the worker has at least 10 years of railroad service.

In FY2017, the gross RRA funding was about $12.7 billion. Railroad retirement annuities are also divided into two tiers. Tier I annuities are designed to be nearly equivalent to Social Security benefits and are based on both railroad retirement and Social Security-covered employment. However, Tier I annuities are more generous than Social Security benefits in certain situations. For example, at the age of 60, railroad workers with at least 30 years of covered railroad work may receive unreduced retirement annuities. Tier II annuities are similar to private pensions and based solely on covered railroad service. Tier II annuities are paid in addition to Tier I annuities.

The military has since cracked down on dissent, including the Muslim Brotherhood, and has implemented a series of austerity measures to reduce debt. Despite economic growth, many Egyptians continue to endure double-digit inflation and high prices for goods. The government has proposed a set of constitutional amendments that would extend presidential term limits and executive branch control over the judiciary, which would grant President Sisi unprecedented power. The country's human rights record has been criticized by the US and other international organizations, with concerns over the treatment of Coptic Christians, LGBTI individuals, and the detention of American citizens. Egypt's economy is expected to continue growing, driven by tourism and natural gas production, but challenges remain, including high inflation and a large public debt. The country's military plays a significant role in the economy, with military-owned companies benefiting from infrastructure contracts and producing goods at lower costs than the private sector.

Although it may not play the same type of leading political or military role in the Arab world as it has in the past, Egypt may retain some \"soft power\" by virtue of its history, media, and culture. Cairo plays host both to the 22-member Arab League and Al Azhar University, which claims to be the oldest continuously operating university in the world and has symbolic importance as a leading source of Islamic scholarship. Additionally, Egypt's 1979 peace treaty with Israel remains one of the most significant diplomatic achievements for the promotion of Arab-Israeli peace. While people-to-people relations remain cold, the Israeli and Egyptian governments have increased their cooperation against Islamist militants and instability in the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza Strip.

President Sisi has come under repeated international criticism for an ongoing government crackdown against various forms of political dissent and freedom of expression. The Egyptian government has defended its human rights record, asserting that the country is under pressure from terrorist groups seeking to destabilize Arab nation-states. The Trump Administration has tried to normalize ties with the Sisi government that were generally perceived as strained under President Obama. In January 2019, U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo delivered a major policy speech at the American University in Cairo, where he stated, \"And as we seek an even stronger partnership with Egypt, we encourage President Sisi to unleash the creative energy of Egypt's people, unfetter the economy, and promote a free and open exchange of ideas.\" The United States has provided significant military and economic assistance to Egypt since the late 1970s.

{"pred": " Passage 2\nThe Government Accountability Office (GAO) has been reviewing the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) management of the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) program. The GAO identified several areas of progress and challenges, including the process for identifying high-risk chemical facilities, risk assessment, and facility compliance inspections. DHS has made significant changes to the CFATS program, including improving data sharing among agencies and states, enhancing its risk assessment approach, and revising its Chemical Security Assessment Tool (CSAT). The GAO found that DHS has made progress in reviewing and approving facility security plans, eliminating the backlog of plans awaiting review, and implementing an Expedited Approval Program (EAP). However, the GAO also noted that the EAP has had low participation, with only 18 of 3,152 eligible facilities opting to use it. The GAO is continuing to review the CFATS program and will report on its findings later this summer. Key evidence supporting the GAO's conclusions includes data on the number of facilities that have reported having ammonium nitrate, the results of DHS's risk assessment approach, and the feedback from facilities that have used the revised CSAT. The GAO's work highlights the importance of effective risk assessment and compliance inspections in ensuring the security of chemical facilities. The innovative point made in the passage is the use of a peer review process to verify and validate the new tiering approach, which is a unique and effective way to ensure the accuracy of risk assessments. Overall, the GAO's review of the CFATS program provides valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities for improving the security of chemical facilities. The GAO's recommendations and findings have the potential to inform policy and decision-making at DHS and other agencies responsible for ensuring the security of chemical facilities. The GAO's work also highlights the importance of collaboration and information sharing among agencies and stakeholders in ensuring the security of chemical facilities. The GAO's review of the CFATS program is ongoing, and the agency will continue to monitor the program's progress and provide updates on its findings. The GAO's work is critical in ensuring the security of chemical facilities and preventing terrorist attacks.

In accordance with the DHS Appropriations Act, 2007, DHS established the CFATS program in 2007 to, among other things, identify and assess the security risk posed by chemical facilities. DHS inspects high-risk facilities after it approves facility security plans to ensure that the facilities are implementing required security measures and procedures. This statement summarizes progress and challenges related to DHS's CFATS program management. This statement is based on prior products GAO issued from July 2012 through June 2017, along with updates conducted in June 2018 on DHS actions to address prior GAO recommendations. To conduct the prior work, GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and DHS policies for administering the CFATS program, how DHS assesses risk, and data on high-risk chemical facilities. GAO also interviewed DHS officials and reviewed information on DHS actions to implement its prior recommendations. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has made progress addressing challenges that GAO's past work identified to managing the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) program. The following summarizes progress made and challenges remaining in key aspects of the program. Identifying high-risk chemical facilities. In July 2015, GAO reported that DHS used self-reported and unverified data to determine the risk of facilities holding toxic chemicals that could threaten surrounding communities if released. GAO recommended that DHS should better verify the accuracy of facility-reported data. DHS implemented this recommendation by revising its methodology so it now calculates the risk of toxic release, rather than relying on facilities to do so. Assessing risk and prioritizing facilities. In April 2013, GAO reported weaknesses in multiple aspects of DHS's risk assessment and prioritization approach. GAO made two recommendations for DHS to review and improve this process, including that DHS enhance its risk assessment approach to incorporate all of the elements of consequence, threat, and vulnerability associated with a terrorist attack involving certain chemicals. DHS launched a new risk assessment methodology in October 2016 and is currently gathering new or updated data from about 27,000 facilities to (1) determine which facilities should be categorized as high-risk because of the threat of sabotage, theft or diversion, or a toxic release and (2) assign those facilities deemed high risk to one of four risk-based tiers. GAO has ongoing work assessing these efforts and will report later this summer on the extent to which they fully address prior recommendations. Reviewing and approving facilities' site security plans . DHS is to review security plans and visit facilities to ensure their security measures meet DHS standards. In April 2013, GAO reported a 7 to 9 year backlog for these reviews and visits. In July 2015, GAO reported that DHS had made substantial progress in addressing the backlog—estimating that it could take between 9 and 12 months for DHS to review and approve security plans for the approximately 900 remaining facilities. DHS has since taken additional action to expedite these activities and has eliminated this backlog. Inspecting facilities and ensuring compliance. In July 2015, GAO reported that DHS conducted compliance inspections at 83 of the 1,727 facilities with approved security plans. GAO found that nearly half of the inspected facilities were not fully compliant with their approved security plans and that DHS did not have documented procedures for managing facilities' compliance. GAO recommended that DHS document procedures for managing compliance. As a result, DHS has developed an enforcement procedure and a draft compliance inspection procedure and expects to finalize the compliance inspection procedure by the end of fiscal year 2018. GAO has made various recommendations to strengthen DHS's management of the CFATS program, with which DHS has generally agreed. DHS has implemented or described planned actions to address most of these recommendations."], "length": 13004}
{"pred": " \nPassage 4 discusses the lack of documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care at five selected VA medical centers. The VA medical centers lacked documentation for almost half of the reviews conducted, and in some cases, the required reviews were not conducted at all. The VA medical centers also failed to report providers to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) and state licensing boards as required by VHA policy. This failure to report providers facilitated those who provided substandard care at one facility to obtain privileges at another VA medical center or at hospitals outside of VA's healthcare system. The VA concurred with the recommendations to require documentation of all reviews of providers' clinical care, establish a timeliness requirement for initiating such reviews, and strengthen oversight by requiring networks to oversee VA medical centers to ensure that such reviews are documented and initiated in a timely manner. The VA also agreed to revise existing policy and update the standardized audit tool used by the networks to include more comprehensive oversight of VA medical centers' reviews of providers' clinical care after concerns have been raised. \n\nPassage 1 discusses the VA's MSPV-NG program, which aims to standardize medical supplies and reduce costs. However, the program's implementation has been hindered by a lack of leadership stability, workforce capacity, and a documented program strategy. The program office initially developed requirements for items to be included in the formulary based on prior supply purchases, with limited clinician involvement. This approach led to a formulary that did not meet the needs of medical centers, and the program has yet to achieve its utilization and cost avoidance goals. The VA has made some changes to address these deficiencies, but the program continues to face challenges. The GAO recommends that the VA develop a clear overall strategy for the program, prioritize the hiring of a permanent program director, and provide complete guidance to medical centers for matching equivalent supply items.\n\nPassage 2 discusses the improper payment laws and the steps that executive branch agencies must take to address improper payments. The agencies must review all programs and activities to identify those that may be susceptible to significant improper payments, develop improper payment estimates, analyze the root causes of improper payments, and report on the results. The GAO reviewed six agencies and 10 programs and found that the agencies' processes for estimating improper payments varied, and certain differences in these processes may affect the quality of the resulting estimates. The GAO recommends that the Director of OMB develop guidance on how agencies test to identify improper payments and clarify the appropriate treatment of nonresponse cases during improper payment testing.\n\n", "answers": ["This testimony summarizes the information contained in GAO's November 2017 report, entitled VA Health Care: Improved Policies and Oversight Needed for Reviewing and Reporting Providers for Quality and Safety Concerns ( GAO-18-63 ). Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (VAMC) officials are responsible for reviewing the clinical care delivered by their privileged providers—physicians and dentists who are approved to independently perform specific services—after concerns are raised. The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care. For example, GAO found that after one VAMC failed to report to the NPDB or SLBs a provider who resigned to avoid an adverse privileging action, a non-VA hospital in the same city took an adverse privileging action against that same provider for the same reason 2 years later."], "length": 13734}
{"pred": " \nThe Small Business Administration (SBA) administers several programs to support small businesses, including the Surety Bond Guarantee Program. The program aims to increase small businesses' access to federal, state, and local government contracting by guaranteeing bid, performance, payment, and specified ancillary bonds. The SBA guarantees individual contracts of up to $6.5 million, and up to $10 million if a federal contracting officer certifies that such a guarantee is necessary. The program has experienced a net positive cash flow in each of the past 12 fiscal years, with about $97 million in the Surety Bond Guarantee Program Revolving Fund. Historically, the program's default rate has averaged about 3% to 5%. The SBA has reported that the program's default rate on Recovery Act bonds was lower than for its other bonds. The SBA has also increased the program's bond limit to $6.5 million, and up to $10 million if a federal contracting officer certifies that such a guarantee is necessary. The SBA has also increased the PSB program's guarantee rate from not to exceed 70% to not to exceed 90% of losses. The SBA has reported that it is focusing on strengthening relationships with individual surety companies and the large network of bond agents and producers across the country in order to reach more small businesses in need of bonding. The SBA has also considered combing the Prior Approval Program and PSB program into a single program featuring the streamlined bond approval and monitoring processes under the PSB program. Congressional testimony and GAO examinations have supported the need for a program such as the SBA's Surety Bond Guarantee Program, but have been less useful in helping Congress determine the appropriate size for the program. The SBA's testimony has tended to focus on the need to attract more sureties to the program, while there has been relatively little testimony provided concerning the broader issue of how large the program should be in comparison with the private sector. \n\nThe VA medical centers reviewed by the GAO lacked documentation to show that almost half of the reviews of providers' clinical care were conducted.

The program guarantees individual contracts of up to $6.5 million, and up to $10 million if a federal contracting officer certifies that such a guarantee is necessary. The SBA's guarantee currently ranges from 80% to 90% of the surety's loss if a default occurs. In FY2018, the SBA guaranteed 10,800 bid and final surety bonds with a total contract value of nearly $6.5 billion. A surety bond is a three-party instrument between a surety (who agrees to be responsible for the debt or obligation of another), a contractor, and a project owner. The agreement binds the contractor to comply with the contract's terms and conditions. If the contractor is unable to successfully perform the contract, the surety assumes the contractor's responsibilities and ensures that the project is completed. Surety bonds encourage project owners to contract with small businesses that may not have the credit history or prior experience of larger businesses and may be at greater risk of failing to comply with the contract's terms and conditions. Surety bonds are important to small businesses interested in competing for federal contracts because the federal government requires prime contractors—prior to the award of a federal contract exceeding $150,000 for the construction, alteration, or repair of any building or public work of the United States—to furnish a performance bond issued by a surety satisfactory to the contracting officer in an amount that the officer considers adequate to protect the government. P.L. 112-239, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013, increased the program's bond limit to $6.5 million, or up to $10 million if a federal contracting officer certifies that such a guarantee is necessary. The limit had been $2 million since 2000, with a temporary increase from February 17, 2009, through September 30, 2010, to $5 million, and up to $10 million if a federal contracting officer certified in writing that such a guarantee was necessary. Advocates of raising the program's bond limit argued that doing so would increase contracting opportunities for small businesses and bring the limit more in line with limits of other small business programs, such as the 8(a) Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development Program and the Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Program. Opponents argued that raising the limit could lead to higher amounts being guaranteed by the SBA and, as a result, increase the risk of program losses. This report examines the program's origin and development, including (1) the decision to supplement the original Prior Approval Program with the Preferred Surety Bond Guarantee Program that initially provided a lower guarantee rate (not to exceed 70%) than the Prior Approval Program (not to exceed 80% or 90%, depending on the size of the contract and the type of small business) in exchange for allowing preferred sureties to issue SBA-guaranteed surety bonds without the SBA's prior approval; (2) P.L. 114-92, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, which increased the Preferred Surety Bond Guarantee Program's guarantee rate from not to exceed 70% to not to exceed 90% of losses; and (3) the decision to increase the program's bond limit."], "length": 13491}

The system allows states and tribes to request FMAG declarations when a fire is burning out of control and threatens to become a major disaster. The request must include cost estimates and information about the fire, and the FMAG declaration authorizes various forms of federal assistance, including equipment, personnel, and grants. The decision to issue a FMAG declaration is not contingent on the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) balance, and FMAGs do not reduce the amount of funding available for major disasters. The cost-share for FMAGs is based on a federal share of 75% of eligible expenses, with the state and subgrantees assuming the remaining 25% of eligible costs. FMAG assistance is similar to other FEMA assistance, with eligible expenses including costs for equipment and supplies, mobilization and demobilization, and emergency work.

Executive branch agencies are required to annually estimate improper payments for certain programs. Estimation of improper payments is key to understanding the extent of the problem and to developing effective corrective actions. Relevant laws and guidance provide agencies flexibility in developing estimates. This report describes agencies' processes to estimate improper payments in selected programs for fiscal year 2017 and the extent to which certain differences in these processes can affect the usefulness of the resulting estimates. GAO selected 10 programs across six agencies with the largest reported program outlays in fiscal years 2015 and 2016. For these programs, GAO reviewed relevant laws and guidance, analyzed agencies' policies and procedures, and interviewed officials at relevant agencies and OMB staff. The six agencies GAO reviewed reported taking various approaches related to key components of estimating improper payments—shown in the figure below—for 10 selected programs, which collectively reported outlays of over $2.5 trillion for fiscal year 2017. Sample selection. Eight of the 10 programs GAO reviewed reported using statistically valid approaches, and the remaining 2 reported using alternative methodologies approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The sampled data elements varied, including payments, medical claims, and tax returns. The age of the data used to develop fiscal year 2017 improper payment estimates also varied, ranging from calendar year 2013 to fiscal year 2017. Identification of improper payments. Some of the six agencies reported using processes designed specifically to estimate improper payments, whereas others reported leveraging existing reviews. These agencies' policies and procedures include a review of aspects of eligibility, except for those related to the Department of Defense's (DOD) Military Pay and the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) Retirement overpayments. DOD and OPM have not fully assessed whether their estimation processes effectively consider key program risks. OMB guidance does not specifically address how agencies are to test to identify improper payments, such as using a risk-based approach to help ensure that key risks of improper payments are addressed. The six agencies also varied in the treatment of insufficient documentation, both in identifying and in reporting the root causes of improper payments. For the agencies that contact entities outside the agency to estimate improper payments, the treatment of nonresponse differed, with one agency including nonresponses as improper payments and another generally excluding the nonresponse cases from review. Although OMB guidance states that agencies should treat cases of insufficient documentation as improper payments, it does not specifically address the treatment of nonresponse cases. Calculation of the improper payment estimate. The six agencies generally reported using law and OMB guidance to calculate improper payment estimates for the selected programs, except for the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) removed overpayments that were recovered when developing its estimate. OMB guidance requires agencies to include recovered amounts in their estimates. Removing these overpayments understates the EITC improper payment estimate and may limit IRS's ability to develop corrective actions to prevent improper payments. GAO recommends that OMB develop guidance on treatment of nonresponse cases and testing to identify improper payments, that DOD and OPM assess their estimation processes, and that IRS revise its methodology to not exclude recovered payments from its estimate. All of the agencies either agreed or partially agreed with the specific recommendations to them. GAO believes that the actions are warranted, as discussed in the report."], "length": 12907}
{"pred": " Passage 2\nThe US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) faces challenges in aligning its services and real property portfolio to meet the needs of veterans. The VA has a large inventory of vacant or underutilized buildings, many of which are historic and difficult to renovate or demolish. The VA's Strategic Capital Investment Planning (SCIP) process has limitations, including subjective narratives, long timeframes, and restricted access to information, which undermine its ability to achieve its goals. The VA has also encountered challenges in engaging stakeholders, including veterans, local officials, and historic preservation groups, which has led to adversarial relationships and reduced the VA's ability to align facilities with the needs of the veteran population. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommends that the VA improve stakeholder communication guidance and evaluate its efforts. The GAO also notes that the VA's Integrated Planning (VAIP) process has limitations, including an assumption that all future growth in services will be provided directly through VA facilities, which is not accurate. The GAO recommends that the VA assess the value of the VAIP's facility master plans as a facility-planning tool and either discontinue or address the limitations of the VAIP process. The GAO also identifies seven elements that the Department of Defense (DOD) relied on as it developed its recommendations for the BRAC Commission, which could be useful for the VA in developing its own asset and infrastructure review process. Overall, the VA faces significant challenges in aligning its services and real property portfolio, and the GAO's recommendations aim to improve the VA's ability to meet the needs of veterans. The GAO also notes that the VA's efforts to address these challenges will require sustained senior leadership attention and a high level of coordination among stakeholders. The GAO's report highlights the importance of effective planning, stakeholder engagement, and data accuracy in achieving the VA's goals.

DOD has repeatedly applied the BRAC process to reduce the amount of unneeded property that it owns and leases and to save billions of dollars that could be applied to higher priority defense needs. This statement is based on GAO's April 2017 report related to VA facility alignment ( GAO-17-349 ) and numerous GAO reports related to the BRAC process as summarized in a June 2011 testimony ( GAO-11-704T ) and a March 2012 testimony ( GAO-12-513T ). This statement addresses (1) the factors that affect VA's facility alignment and the extent to which VA's capital-planning process facilitates the alignment of facilities with the veterans' population, and (2) the key elements and challenges affecting DOD and the Commission in BRAC 2005. Detailed information on our scope and methodologies for this work can be found in these published products, cited throughout this testimony. Geographic shifts in the veterans' population, changes in health care delivery, aging infrastructure, and limited stakeholder involvement affect the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) efforts to align its services and real property portfolio to meet the needs of veterans. For example, a shift over time from inpatient to outpatient care will likely result in underutilized space once used for inpatient care. Further, the historic status of some VA facilities adds to the complexity of converting or disposing of them. In such instances, it is often difficult and costly for VA to modernize, renovate, and retrofit these older facilities. GAO reported that two of the planning processes VA uses to align its facilities—VA's Strategic Capital Investment Planning (SCIP) and the VA Integrated Planning (VAIP)—have limitations that undermine VA's efforts to achieve its goals. Specifically: VA relies on the SCIP process to plan and prioritize capital projects, but VA routinely asks its facility planners to submit their next year's planned project narratives before knowing if their previous submissions have been funded. The overlapping budget cycle, which is outside of VA's control, combined with other SCIP limitations—including subjective narratives, long time frames, and restricted access to information—make it difficult for VA to rely on SCIP to accurately identify the capital necessary to address its service and infrastructure gaps. VA concurred that it needs to address SCIP limitations that are within its control, as GAO recommended; VA has made some progress in implementing the recommendation has made some progress in implementing the recommendation.\\ The VAIP process is estimated to cost $108 million and to produce market-level service delivery plans and facility master plans. However, the VAIP master plans incorrectly assume that all future growth in services will be provided directly through VA facilities without considering alternatives, such as purchasing care from the community. GAO recommended that VA consider discontinuing the VAIP facility master plans pending an assessment of their value as a facility-planning tool. VA agreed with the recommendation and is implementing it while pursuing a national realignment strategy.. Key elements of the Department of Defense's (DOD) 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process could benefit VA's asset and infrastructure review. The key elements included: (1) establishing goals for the process, (2) developing criteria for evaluating closures and realignments, and (3) establishing an organizational structure to develop closure and realignment options. GAO identified key challenges that affected DOD's implementation of BRAC 2005 and the results achieved; these challenges would need to be addressed if VA is to successfully apply the process. These challenges included: (1) large, complex recommendations required sustained senior leadership's attention and a high level of coordination among many stakeholders, and (2) the large number of actions that depend on each other for successful implementation. In the April 2017 report, GAO made recommendations related to capital planning and stakeholder involvement.

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (VAMC) officials are responsible for reviewing the clinical care delivered by their privileged providers—physicians and dentists who are approved to independently perform specific services—after concerns are raised. The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care. For example, GAO found that after one VAMC failed to report to the NPDB or SLBs a provider who resigned to avoid an adverse privileging action, a non-VA hospital in the same city took an adverse privileging action against that same provider for the same reason 2 years later."], "length": 13916}

DOD has launched three experimental payloads on commercial host satellites and plans to conduct three more missions through 2022. The use of commercially hosted payloads can provide cost savings, faster on-orbit capability, increased deterrence and resilience, and continual technology upgrades and industrial base stability. However, DOD officials identified logistical challenges to matching government payloads with commercial host satellites, including size, weight, and power constraints. The HPO is developing tools to help address these challenges, and DOD offices that have used hosted payloads have found ways to overcome them. The HPO is also developing a hosted payload interface unit that could provide a standard for payload developers and system integrators to develop and test their systems. Despite the potential benefits of commercially hosted payloads, DOD's knowledge of these payloads is limited, and the agency does not collect or consolidate agency-wide knowledge on commercially hosted payloads. The Secretary of Defense should require programs using hosted payloads to provide cost and technical data, and lessons learned to a central office. In implementing this recommendation, DOD should consider whether the Hosted Payload Office is the most appropriate office to centralize agency-wide knowledge.

For such satellite systems, a single adversary attack or on-orbit failure can result in the loss of billions of dollars of investment and significant loss of vital capabilities. As DOD plans new space systems and addresses an increasingly contested space environment, it has the opportunity to consider different acquisition approaches. One such approach is to integrate a government sensor or payload onto a commercial host satellite. House Armed Services Committee report 115-200, accompanying a bill for the Fiscal Year 2018 National Defense Authorization Act, included a provision for GAO to review DOD's use of commercially hosted payloads. This report (1) determines the extent to which DOD uses commercially hosted payloads and (2) describes and assesses factors that affect their use. GAO reviewed DOD policies, documentation, and planning documents, and interviewed a wide range of DOD and civil government officials, and commercial stakeholders. GAO and others have found that using commercial satellites to host government sensors or communications packages—called payloads—may be one way DOD can achieve on-orbit capability faster and more affordably. Using hosted payloads may also help facilitate a proliferation of payloads on orbit, making it more difficult for an adversary to defeat a capability. Since 2009, DOD has used three commercially hosted payloads, with three more missions planned or underway through 2022 (see figure below). DOD estimates that it has achieved cost savings of several hundred million dollars from using commercially hosted payloads to date, and expects to realize additional savings and deliver faster capabilities on orbit from planned missions. Cost savings can result from sharing development, launch, and ground system costs with the commercial host company. Among the factors that affect DOD's use of hosted payloads are a perception among some DOD officials that matching government payloads to commercial satellites is too difficult; and limited, fragmented knowledge on how to mitigate various challenges GAO found that further opportunities to use hosted payloads may emerge as DOD plans new and follow-on space systems in the coming years. However, DOD's knowledge on using hosted payloads is fragmented, in part because programs are not required to share information. In 2011, the Air Force created a Hosted Payload Office to provide expertise and other tools to facilitate matching government payloads with commercial hosts. However, GAO found that DOD programs using hosted payloads are not required and generally do not provide cost and technical data, or lessons learned, to the Hosted Payload Office, or another central office for analysis. Requiring programs that use hosted payloads agency-wide to provide this information to a central location would better position DOD to make informed decisions when considering acquisition approaches for upcoming space system designs. GAO recommends that DOD require programs using commercially hosted payloads to contribute resulting data to a central location. In implementing this recommendation, DOD should assess whether the Air Force's Hosted Payload Office is the appropriate location to collect and analyze the data. DOD concurred with the recommendation."], "length": 13157}

The Industrial Designer suggested using plastic as the primary material due to concerns about metal interference with the remote's functionality. The Designer also proposed using high-grade recycled plastic for the user interface and a silicon-based chip for the microprocessor. The Project Manager agreed with the Designer's suggestions, considering the cost and aesthetic value of the remote. The team also discussed the possibility of using modern types of polymers or plastics with aesthetic value, such as those used in laptop designs. The Project Manager concluded that plastic would be the primary material, with a focus on using high-quality recycled plastic and a touch screen for the basic functions. The team also discussed the possibility of using voice recognition technology for the remote, with the Industrial Designer suggesting that it could be combined with a locator device to help users find the remote when it is lost. The Project Manager agreed that this was a good idea, but noted that it would require further development and testing.

To be eligible for PSOB benefits, a person must have served in a public agency in an official capacity, with or without compensation, and have sustained a personal injury that resulted in death or permanent disability. The PSOB program pays benefits if a public safety officer becomes permanently and totally disabled or dies as a direct result of a personal injury sustained in the line of duty. The benefit amount is adjusted annually to reflect changes in the cost of living. Death and disability benefits are not subject to federal income tax and are paid in addition to any other workers' compensation, life insurance, or other benefits. The PSOEA program provides financial assistance with costs associated with higher education to the spouse or children of a public safety officer who is eligible for PSOB death or disability benefits. The monthly PSOEA benefit amount is equal to the monthly benefit amount payable under the GI Bill Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) program. The PSOEA benefit amounts are adjusted annually to reflect changes in the cost of living. A claimant who is dissatisfied with a PSOB disability benefit denial may request a reconsideration, but there is no reconsideration offered for denials of PSOB death or PSOEA benefits. The PSOB Office director's determination is considered the final agency determination and is not subject to any further agency administrative review or appeal.

{"pred": " \nThe federal government has taken steps to improve the management of federal real property and address long-standing issues by undertaking several government-wide initiatives and issuing memorandums to the CFO Act agencies. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the General Services Administration (GSA) provide leadership in managing federal real property. The RTF policy, which was implemented in 2015, aims to reduce the federal government's real property footprint by freezing growth in the inventory, measuring performance, and reducing the size of the inventory. The policy requires agencies to submit annual Real Property Efficiency Plans (Plans) to GSA and OMB, which outline their strategies for reducing space. The Plans show that agencies are using various approaches to reduce space, including consolidation, co-location, disposal of unneeded space, better utilization of existing space, and teleworking and hoteling. However, agencies face challenges in achieving their space reduction targets, including space reduction costs, mission delivery requirements, employee organization concerns, and workload growth. Despite these challenges, the majority of agencies (71%) reported achieving reductions in their office and warehouse space in fiscal year 2016, with some agencies exceeding their targets. GSA has also made progress in managing vacated space, with a 3% vacancy rate in fiscal year 2016, exceeding its performance goal of 3.2%. The government-wide cost avoidance for fiscal year 2016 was $104 million, with a total cost avoidance of over $75.8 million associated with office and warehouse space reductions in federally-owned space under GSA's custody and control and commercial space GSA leased. Overall, the RTF policy has been successful in reducing the federal government's real property footprint, but agencies continue to face challenges in achieving their space reduction targets. The GSA's centralized e-mail and spreadsheet have helped to streamline the process of receiving, reviewing, and documenting agencies' space release actions, and the agency's regional offices track all occupancy agreements and proactively work with customer agencies to help manage their space needs. The GSA's vacant space performance goal is to have a 3.2% vacancy rate for federally-owned and leased inventory, with a 5% goal for federally-owned and 1.5% goal for leased space. The agency has steadily lowered its percentage of vacant space under its custody and control from 3.8% in fiscal year 2013 to 3% in fiscal year 2016, exceeding its performance goal for the first time in 4 years.

GSA provides space for agencies in government-owned and commercially leased buildings. In 2015, the OMB issued a memorandum requiring the 24 agencies with chief financial officers to reduce their domestic office and warehouse space. These agencies are required to set annual reduction targets for a 5-year time period and update their real property plans annually. GAO was asked to review the implementation of this space reduction initiative. This report discusses: (1) the approaches and any challenges the 24 agencies identified to achieving their reduction targets for all their domestic office and warehouse space; (2) the extent these agencies reduced their space and met their fiscal year 2016 targets; and (3) how GSA manages vacated space it had leased to these agencies. GAO conducted a content analysis of the 24 agencies' real property plans for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 and analyzed agencies' data as submitted to GSA on their targets and reductions for fiscal year 2016, the only year for which data were available. GAO selected five agencies as case studies based on several factors, including size of the agencies' office and warehouse portfolio, agency reduction targets, and fiscal year 2016 reported reductions. GAO reviewed relevant documentation and interviewed officials from GSA, OMB, and GAO's case study agencies. GAO provided a draft of this product to GSA, OMB, and our case study agencies for comment. GAO incorporated technical comments, as appropriate. Most of the 24 agencies with chief financial officers reported to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the General Services Administration (GSA) that they planned to consolidate their office and warehouse space and allocate fewer square feet per employee as the key ways to achieve their space reduction targets. For example, the Department of Agriculture reported it will consolidate staff from five component agencies in two office buildings. When complete, the space allocated per employee will average about 250 square feet down from a high of 420 square feet per employee. In taking these actions, the agencies most often identified the cost of space reduction projects as a challenge to achieving their targets. Agencies cited costs such as for space renovations to accommodate more staff and required environmental clean-up before disposing of property as challenges to completing projects. Some agencies required to maintain offices across the country reported that their mission requirements limit their ability to reduce their space. In fiscal year 2016, 17 of the 24 agencies reported they reduced their space, but had varying success achieving their first-year targets. Of the 17 agencies, 9 exceeded their target and reduced more space than planned, 7 missed their target (by anywhere between 2.8 and 96.7 percent), and 1 reduced space, despite a targeted increase. Agency officials said that it is not unusual for projects to shift to different years and that such shifts could lead to missing targets one year and exceeding them the next. GSA has processes to manage the space vacated by agencies that is leased through GSA. For example, starting in November 2016, GSA started tracking agencies' space release requests centrally to help standardize the process and established an e-mail address to which agencies can submit requests. GSA relies on regional offices to manage real property in their regions and to identify tenants for vacant space or to remove unused space from the inventory. GSA's regional officials said regular monitoring and coordinating with agencies minimizes the likelihood GSA is caught off guard by a return of space. These processes also help them to plan ahead. GSA met its 2016 performance goal to have an annual vacant space rate of no more than 3.2 percent in its federally owned and leased buildings. However, given the recent implementation of the space reduction initiative, it is too early to determine the extent to which agencies will return space to GSA prior to the end of their leases and the effect on GSA's inventory."], "length": 13302}

The excepted service includes positions that are not in the competitive service or the SES, and employees in this service are also paid according to the General Schedule but may have different durational requirements before they can avail themselves of notice and appeal rights. The SES is a cadre of high-level government administrators who manage major programs and projects within federal agencies, and its pay structure is distinct from the rest of the civil service.

Federal law categorizes these employees into three types of service—the competitive service, the excepted service, and the Senior Executive Service (SES)—that may be distinguished by different selection, compensation, and other standards. Title 5 of the U.S. Code (Title 5) contains most of the standards governing federal employment, and OPM is generally responsible for implementing these requirements. The competitive service largely consists of all civil service positions in the executive branch, other than (1) positions excepted from the competitive service by statute; (2) positions appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate; and (3) the SES. Traditionally, OPM has administered examinations for entrance into the competitive service. These examinations are meant to be \"practical in character\" and relate to \"matters that fairly test the relative capacity and fitness of the applicants for the appointment sought.\" Title 5 also authorizes OPM to prescribe rules allowing agencies to hire candidates directly under specified circumstances. The excepted service includes designated civil service positions that are not in the competitive service or the SES and are not subject to competitive examination. OPM maintains authority to exempt a position from the competitive service when it determines that an appointment through competitive examination is not practicable, or the recruitment of students or recent graduates would be better achieved through alternate recruitment and assessment processes. The pay structure for the competitive service and the excepted service is similar. Both services are typically paid in accordance with the General Schedule, a schedule of annual basic pay rates that consists of 15 grades, designated \"GS-1\" through \"GS-15.\" This fixed pay scale is generally designed to reflect, among other things, equal pay for substantially equal work within a local pay area. Additionally, the competitive service and the excepted service generally have similar notice and appeal rights for adverse personnel actions. For example, before a removal, a suspension for more than 14 days, a reduction in grade or pay, or a furlough of 30 days or less, the agency must provide at least 30 days' advance written notice to the affected employee. The employee must also be given a reasonable time to respond to the notice and provide affidavits and other evidence to support the answer. Some adverse actions may also be appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB or Board), an independent, quasi-judicial agency that reviews and adjudicates specified personnel actions taken against qualifying federal employees. The SES is a corps of some 7,000 high-level government administrators who manage major programs and projects within most federal agencies. In these leadership roles, SES members may serve as a link between top-level political appointees of an agency and career civil servants within the agency. The SES is governed by a regulatory structure separate from the competitive and excepted services. While SES members are primarily career appointees chosen through a merit-based competitive hiring process, others are noncareer, limited term or limited emergency appointees (commonly political appointees) selected by agency leadership. To shield certain SES roles from political influence, some SES positions (career reserved positions) must be filled with career appointees, and Title 5 limits the number of noncareer and limited term appointees that may serve in SES positions. The SES pay structure is distinct from the rest of the civil service. Title 5 specifies that SES members are paid within a particular range based on an executive's individual performance or contribution to agency performance (or both), as measured under a performance appraisal system. In addition, Title 5 articulates special conditions and procedures for removing, suspending, or taking other adverse actions against a member of the SES. For example, career SES appointees who have successfully completed a one-year probationary period may be removed or subject to adverse action only for specified reasons, including misconduct and substandard performance. Career appointees must receive advance written notice of these actions, and an opportunity to appeal the action. In comparison, noncareer, limited term, and limited emergency appointees are generally not subject to the same protections and may be removed from the SES at any time."], "length": 12443}

According to DEA data, about 3% of pharmacies and other eligible entities have voluntarily chosen to become DEA-authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs. The costs associated with participating include the one-time cost of purchasing and installing a disposal bin, the ongoing costs to train personnel to manage the bins, and the cost of contracting with a reverse distributor to periodically dispose of the bin's inner liner and contents. DEA officials stated that addressing cost issues with eligible participants falls outside of their responsibilities. Stakeholders also noted that some DEA requirements related to disposal bins may conflict with other state and federal requirements governing the transportation and disposal of hazardous waste.

One way to help prevent this kind of diversion and potential misuse is by providing secure and convenient ways to dispose of unused, unneeded, or expired prescription medications. The Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010 authorizes pharmacies and other entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances to also collect unused prescription drugs for disposal. In 2014, DEA finalized regulations for the implementation of the Act, establishing a voluntary process for eligible entities to become authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs using disposal bins. GAO was asked to review participation among authorized collectors that maintain disposal bins. In this report GAO describes (1) participation rates among entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs and (2) factors that affect participation. GAO analyzed the most currently available DEA data from April 2017 on entities eligible to participate and those participating as authorized collectors. GAO also conducted interviews with DEA officials and a nongeneralizable sample of 11 stakeholder organizations selected to illustrate different types of authorized collectors and long-term care facilities. GAO is not making any recommendations. DEA provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. GAO found that about 3 percent of pharmacies and other entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs for disposal have volunteered to do so.

Analysis of DEA data shows that as of April 2017, 2,233 of the 89,550 (2.49 percent) eligible entities—that is, certain entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances—had registered with DEA to use disposal bins to collect unused prescription drugs. Most—about 81 percent—of the authorized collectors were pharmacies, followed by hospitals or clinics. GAO also found that participation rates varied by state, though in 44 states less than 5 percent of the state's pharmacies and other eligible entities had registered to become authorized collectors. Stakeholders cited several factors that may explain why relatively few pharmacies and other eligible entities have registered with DEA as authorized collectors of unused drugs. Most notably, stakeholders representing authorized collectors told GAO that because participation is voluntary, the cost associated with maintaining a disposal bin—which includes purchasing and installing the bin according to DEA requirements and paying for the destruction of its contents—is an important factor to weigh against potential benefits. DEA noted that availability of disposal by law enforcement agencies also contributes to low participation."], "length": 13322}

The passage also discusses the importance of the location of these radar systems, with Cobra Dane's location at Shemya Island, Alaska, providing advantages in tracking missile threats from North Korea. However, the passage notes that the Air Force's report to Congress incorrectly stated that Cobra Dane has the capability to determine if a missile threat is successfully intercepted. The passage also discusses the planned replacement of Cobra Dane with the LRDR radar system and the potential for other radar investments to reduce the department's reliance on Cobra Dane. The key evidence presented includes data on the operational availability of Cobra Dane, which has declined from 91% to 88% over a two-year period, and the planned funding for the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane. The passage highlights the importance of the sustainment of Cobra Dane and the challenges faced by the Air Force and MDA in expediting the modernization projects for the radar system. The unique point made in the passage is the potential for other radar investments to reduce the department's reliance on Cobra Dane, which could impact the radar system's operational availability and the department's ability to conduct space surveillance.

Anticipating future needs, DOD began investing in new radar systems that share capabilities with Cobra Dane to support ballistic missile defense and space surveillance, including the LRDR (Alaska), the Space Fence (Marshall Islands), and the Pacific Radar (location to be determined). The conference report accompanying a bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 included a provision that GAO review the Air Force's report to Congress on the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane. This report identifies information included in the Air Force's report and describes additional information that GAO reviewed on (1) the capabilities of the Cobra Dane radar and other planned radars to meet DOD's mission requirements, (2) Cobra Dane's operational availability and the plan to mitigate the effect on those missions when Cobra Dane is not available, and (3) DOD's funding plan and project cost estimates for the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane and its site at Shemya Island. GAO reviewed the Air Force report and related documentation, and interviewed relevant officials. In its January 2018 report to Congress, the Air Force reported how the Cobra Dane radar and the Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR) have shared and unique capabilities to support ballistic missile defense and space surveillance missions. The report noted that the respective locations of both radar systems affect their ability to provide those capabilities. The Department of Defense (DOD) also has other radar investments—the Pacific Radar and the Space Fence, which, according to DOD officials, may reduce DOD's reliance on Cobra Dane to provide ballistic missile defense and space surveillance capabilities. The Air Force's report to Congress noted that Cobra Dane met its requirement for operational availability, which refers to the percentage of time that the radar is able to meet its missions. GAO found that the Air Force has developed procedures to mitigate risks when Cobra Dane is not available. For example, U.S. Northern Command and Missile Defense Agency (MDA) officials stated that they can mitigate risks when Cobra Dane is not available by using the Sea-Based X-band radar to provide support for ballistic missile defense. The Air Force would face some limitations in its ability to conduct space surveillance if Cobra Dane were not available, as Cobra Dane tracks objects no other radar can track. However, MDA officials noted there are no plans to take Cobra Dane offline long enough to compromise space surveillance. The Air Force and MDA plan to contribute total funding of $278.6 million for the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane, according to their fiscal year 2019 budget plans. Specifically, the Air Force and MDA plan to share funding for the operation and maintenance of the Cobra Dane radar and for three modernization projects that make up their sustainment plan for the radar. Further, the Air Force report noted that the Air Force also plans to provide $140 million in funding for the sustainment and maintenance of operational access to Cobra Dane's site at Shemya Island.

The fund also receives mandatory appropriations under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (GOMESA). The level of annual appropriations for the LWCF has varied since the origin of the fund in FY1965. The LWCF Act outlines uses of the fund for federal and state purposes. Of the total made available through appropriations or deposits under GOMESA, not less than 40% is to be used for \"federal purposes\" and not less than 40% is to be used to provide \"financial assistance to states.\" The act lists the federal purposes for which the President is to allot LWCF funds \"unless otherwise allotted in the appropriation Act making them available.\" These purposes primarily relate to acquisition of lands and waters (and interests therein) by the federal government. With regard to state purposes, the act authorizes a matching grant program to states for outdoor recreation purposes. Throughout the LWCF's history, appropriations acts typically have provided funds for land acquisition and outdoor recreational grants to states. Beginning in FY1998, appropriations also have been provided each year (except FY1999) to fund other purposes related to natural resources. The extent to which the LWCF should be used for purposes other than federal land acquisition and outdoor recreation grants to states, and which other purposes should be funded from the LWCF, continue to be the subject of legislation and debate in Congress. In the past few decades, Presidents have sought LWCF funds for a variety of other purposes. Congress chooses which if any of these requests to fund, and has chosen programs not sought by the President for a particular year. Among other programs, appropriations have been provided for facility maintenance of the land management agencies, ecosystem restoration, the Historic Preservation Fund, the Payments in Lieu of Taxes program, the Forest Legacy Program, State and Tribal Wildlife Grants (under the Fish and Wildlife Service), the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund, U.S. Geological Survey science and cooperative programs, and Bureau of Indian Affairs Indian Land and Water Claim Settlements. Since FY1998, a total of $2.7 billion has been appropriated for other purposes, of a total LWCF appropriation of $18.9 billion over the history of the fund. The Fish and Wildlife Service and the Forest Service have received the largest shares of the total appropriations for other purposes, about $1.4 billion (53%) and $1.0.billion (38%), respectively, from FY1998 to FY2019. Several agencies shared the remaining $0.2 billion (9%) of the appropriations. Both the dollar amounts and the percentages of annual LWCF appropriations for other purposes have varied widely since FY1998. The dollar amounts have ranged from $0 in FY1999 to $456.0 million in FY2001. The percentage of annual funds provided for other purposes ranged from 0% in FY1999 to a high of 59% in both FY2006 and FY2007. In some years, the appropriation for other purposes was significantly less than the Administration requested. For instance, for FY2008, the George W.

WMATA operates six rail lines and has 118 linear miles of guideway. The authority's capital investments are funded through grants from the federal government, matching funds from states and local jurisdictions, and long-term debt. From fiscal years 2011 through 2017, WMATA received about $5.8 billion in capital funding, with the federal government providing about 55% of the funding. WMATA has a capital planning process that includes developing a Capital Needs Inventory, annual capital budget, and Six-Year Capital Improvement Program. However, the authority has not established documented policies and procedures for its capital planning process, which has led to inconsistent and inefficient capital investment decisions. WMATA has also not developed performance measures to assess capital projects and the capital planning process. The authority has made progress in reducing track defects and electrical fires, but still faces challenges in implementing its track preventive maintenance program. WMATA officials have identified several challenges, including securing sufficient track time, demonstrating work time productivity, and overcoming resource constraints. The authority has not conducted a comprehensive risk assessment of the track preventive maintenance program, which is necessary to ensure the program's long-term viability. WMATA has not prepared a formal program management plan for the track preventive maintenance program, which is also necessary to ensure the program's success. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has made five recommendations to WMATA to address these issues, including establishing documented policies and procedures for the capital planning process, developing performance measures, and conducting a comprehensive risk assessment of the track preventive maintenance program. WMATA has partially concurred with these recommendations, but has not fully implemented them. The GAO will continue to monitor WMATA's progress in addressing these issues.

WMATA initiated a new preventive maintenance program for its rail track in 2017, and is currently implementing a new capital planning process. GAO was asked to examine issues related to WMATA's capital funding and maintenance practices. This report examines: (1) how WMATA spent its capital funds from fiscal years 2011 through 2017, (2) how WMATA's new capital planning process addresses weaknesses it identified in the prior process, and (3) WMATA's progress toward its track preventive maintenance program's goals and how the program aligns with leading program management practices. GAO analyzed WMATA's financial and program information, interviewed officials of WMATA, the Federal Transit Administration, and five transit agencies selected for similarities to WMATA. GAO compared WMATA's capital planning process and track maintenance program with leading practices. From fiscal years 2011 through 2017, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) spent almost $6 billion on a variety of capital assets, with the largest share spent on improving its rail and bus fleet (see figure). Over this period, WMATA's capital spending was, on average, about $845 million annually. WMATA's new capital planning process could address some weaknesses it identified in the prior process. WMATA established a framework for quantitatively prioritizing capital needs (investments to a group of related assets) over a 10-year period. However, WMATA has not established documented policies and procedures for implementing the new process, such as those for selecting specific projects for funding in its annual capital budget. WMATA is currently using its new capital planning process to make fiscal year 2020 investment decisions. WMATA has proposed a fiscal year 2020 capital budget of $1.4 billion. Without documented policies and procedures for implementing the new planning process, WMATA's stakeholders do not have reasonable assurance that WMATA is following a sound process for making investment decisions. WMATA has made significant progress toward its track preventive maintenance program's goals, which are to reduce both track-defect and electrical-fire incidents by 50 percent in fiscal year 2019 compared with 2017. In fiscal year 2018, WMATA met its goal for reducing track defect incidents and reduced electrical fire incidents by 20 percent. However, in designing the program, WMATA did not fully assess risks. For example, WMATA did not quantitatively assess the impact of track defects or electrical fires on its ability to provide service, nor did it consider other risks such as non-electrical track fires, which represent about 30 percent of all fires on the system, or other factors, such as resources or track time. Without a comprehensive risk assessment, WMATA lacks reasonable assurance that the program is designed to address risks affecting the safety of the rail system or other risks that could hinder the new program's success. GAO is making five recommendations, including that WMATA establish documented policies and procedures for the new capital planning process and conduct a comprehensive risk assessment for the track preventive maintenance program.

The General Services Administration (GSA) assists agencies in disposing of personal property and has established a government-wide personal-property disposal process. Agencies have the option to transfer, donate, sell, or abandon or destroy excess property. The GAO found that the five selected agencies reviewed did not have systematic processes for identifying unneeded property, and officials relied on \"triggering events\" such as office moves or lifecycle replacements to declare property as excess. The GAO recommended that the Director of OMB provide guidance to executive agencies on managing their personal property, emphasizing the need to continuously review and identify unneeded property. The GAO also found that agencies may be retaining property that is no longer needed, and that GSA's authority is limited to agency property that has been declared excess or surplus. The GAO suggested that OMB issue guidance to agencies to improve their property management practices. The GAO's review of the selected agencies' personal property management policies found that they did not have policies or processes for identifying unneeded property, and that officials relied on informal means to dispose of excess property.

By law, each agency is required to follow GSA's disposal process so that an agency's unneeded property can be used by other agencies or certain non-federal entities. Since 2012, agencies have reduced their office and warehouse space due to government-wide initiatives, a reduction that in turn has required agencies to dispose of some affected personal property. GAO was asked to review how federal agencies identify and dispose of unneeded personal property. This report examines (1) how selected agencies assess whether personal property is needed and (2) how these agencies dispose of unneeded property and how, if at all, space reduction efforts have affected disposals. GAO reviewed federal statutes and regulations, and selected five agencies—EPA, Forest Service, GSA, HUD, and IRS—mainly based on space reduction results and goals. GAO reviewed these agencies' property disposal data for 2012 through 2016 and interviewed headquarters and field staff about their property management and disposal processes. The five agencies GAO reviewed—the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Forest Service, General Services Administration (GSA), Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and Internal Revenue Service (IRS)—generally do not have policies or processes for identifying unneeded personal property, such as office furniture, on a proactive basis. Instead, officials from these agencies said they typically identified unneeded property as a result of a “triggering event,” such as an office space reduction. Executive agencies are required by law to continuously review property under their control to identify unneeded personal property and then dispose of it promptly. Without such policies or processes, agencies may not be routinely identifying unneeded property that could be used elsewhere, and efforts to maximize federal personal property use and minimize unnecessary storage costs may not be effective. GSA has issued regulations establishing a government-wide disposal process for unneeded personal property. However, according to GSA officials, the agency lacks the authority to promulgate regulations or formal guidance on management of in-use agency property, and there is no government-wide guidance to agencies on identifying unneeded personal property. Agencies are required to have internal control activities—such as policies and procedures—for reasonable assurance of efficient operations and minimal resource waste, and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provides guidance to agencies on implementing such activities. Guidance from OMB that emphasizes agencies' internal control responsibilities could help ensure that agencies are proactively and regularly identifying property that is no longer needed. The selected agencies reported little difficulty in following GSA's personal property disposal process, reporting over 37,000 items as unneeded property in fiscal years 2012 through 2016. This property was disposed of through transfers to other agencies, donations to authorized recipients, sales, or discarding. When disposing of personal property from space reduction projects at locations GAO visited, agencies also reported using GSA's process (see figure). Overall, agencies said they have not experienced major challenges with disposing of personal property from space reduction efforts. This lack of challenges could be because projects are geographically dispersed and spread over several years.

The SPR's current size is 695 million barrels, but it is expected to decline to 405 million barrels due to congressionally mandated oil sales. The SPR's design capacity is 713.5 million barrels, but excess storage capacity will grow to 308 million barrels or more by 2027. The SPR's modernization plans are based on outdated assumptions, and the agency lacks the authority to pursue options such as leasing storage capacity to private industry or selling tickets for excess oil. The SPR's current configuration is limited in its ability to respond to domestic disruptions, as it is primarily composed of crude oil and not refined petroleum products. The Quadrennial Energy Review of 2015 recommended that the agency analyze the need for additional regional product reserves, but DOE has not completed studies on all vulnerable U.S. regions. The SPR's long-term target for size and configuration is uncertain, and Congress could address this uncertainty by identifying a long-term target for the SPR's size. The GAO recommends that the Secretary of Energy conduct an additional analysis that takes into account private-sector response, oil market projections, and costs and benefits of a wide range of different SPR sizes. The GAO also recommends that the Secretary of Energy conduct or complete studies on the costs and benefits of regional petroleum product reserves for all U.S. regions that have been identified as vulnerable to fuel supply disruptions.

DOE manages the SPR. As a member of the International Energy Agency, the United States is obligated to maintain reserves equivalent to at least 90 days of the previous year's net imports (imports minus exports). The SPR's storage and related infrastructure is aging, and DOE has plans to modernize these facilities. Since 2015, Congress has mandated crude oil sales. As of March 2018, the SPR held about 665 million barrels of crude oil. GAO was asked to examine the SPR's ability to meet U.S. energy security needs. This report examines, among other things, the extent to which (1) DOE has identified the optimal size of the SPR, and (2) DOE's plans for modernizing the SPR take into account the effects of congressionally mandated crude oil sales. GAO reviewed DOE's plans and studies, and interviewed agency officials and nine experts selected based on prior work, referrals, and a literature review. The Department of Energy (DOE) has not identified the optimal size of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). In 2016, DOE completed a long-term strategic review of the SPR after its last comprehensive examination conducted in 2005. The 2016 review examined the benefits of several SPR sizes, but it did not identify an optimal size and its review was limited in several ways. In particular, DOE did not fully consider recent and expected future changes in market conditions, such as the implications of falling net imports, or the role that increased levels of private reserves (reserves held by private companies for their own purposes) may play in responding to supply disruptions. These changes have contributed to SPR and private reserves reaching historically high levels on a net imports basis (see figure). These changes are expected to continue to evolve—according to government projections, the United States will become a net exporter in the late 2020s before again becoming a net importer between 2040 and 2050. GAO has found that agencies should reexamine their programs if conditions change. Without addressing the limitations of its 2016 review and periodically performing reexaminations in the future, DOE cannot be assured that the SPR will be sized appropriately into the future. DOE has taken steps to take into account congressionally mandated sales of SPR crude oil in its $1.4 billion modernization plans for SPR's infrastructure and facilities. The SPR is projected to hold 405 million barrels of oil by the end of fiscal year 2027. However, DOE's current plans are based on information analyzed prior to recently mandated sales. According to DOE officials, the agency began a study in March 2018 to assess the effects of these sales on the SPR's modernization. However, this study is not examining all options for handling any excess SPR assets that may be created by currently mandated sales or any additional sales that may be mandated in the future, inconsistent with an agency order on real property asset management that calls for identifying excess assets. For example, DOE does not plan to examine the potential to lease unused SPR storage capacity to the private sector because DOE is not currently authorized to enter into such leases, according to agency officials. If authorized, leasing capacity could generate revenues that could help offset the costs of modernization. By not examining a full range of options, DOE risks missing beneficial ways to modernize the SPR while saving taxpayer resources. GAO is making four recommendations, including that DOE (1) supplement the 2016 review by conducting an additional analysis, (2) ensure that the agency periodically reexamines the size of the SPR, and (3) consider a full range of options for handling potentially excess assets as it conducts its study, among other things. DOE agreed with two, partially agreed with one, and disagreed with another recommendation on refined product reserve studies. GAO maintains that the recommendations are valid."], "length": 12376}

The House can amend its rules unilaterally and is free to suspend, waive, or ignore its rules whenever it chooses to do so. The rules limit debate in several ways, including imposing time limits on speeches and requiring that all debate be germane to the legislative business at hand. The House also has procedures for determining the order of business, including the use of calendars and the consideration of measures under the suspension of the rules procedure. The House frequently considers several suspension motions on the same day, which can result in a series of electronically recorded votes taking place at 40-minute intervals.

On a day-to-day basis, however, the House can also decide to grant individual bills privileged access to the floor, using one of several parliamentary mechanisms. The standing rules of the House include several different parliamentary mechanisms that the body may use to act on bills and resolutions. Which of these will be employed in a given instance usually depends on the extent to which Members want to debate and amend the legislation. In general, all of the procedures of the House permit a majority of Members to work their will without excessive delay. The House considers most legislation by motions to suspend the rules, with limited debate and no floor amendments, with the support of at least two-thirds of the Members voting. Occasionally, the House will choose to consider a measure on the floor by the unanimous consent of Members. The Rules Committee is instrumental in recommending procedures for considering major bills and may propose restrictions on the floor amendments that Members can offer or bar them altogether. Many major bills are first considered in Committee of the Whole before being passed by a simple majority vote of the House. The Committee of the Whole is governed by more flexible procedures than the basic rules of the House, under which a majority can vote to pass a bill after only one hour of debate and with no floor amendments. Although a quorum is supposed to be present on the floor when the House is conducting business, the House assumes a quorum is present unless a quorum call or electronically recorded vote demonstrates that it is not. However, the standing rules preclude quorum calls at most times other than when the House is voting. Questions are first decided by voice vote, although any Member may then demand a division vote. Before the final result of a voice or division vote is announced, Members can secure an electronically recorded vote instead if enough Members desire it or if a quorum is not present in the House. The constitutional requirements for making law mean that each chamber must pass the same measure with the identical text before transmitting it to the President for his consideration. When the second chamber of Congress amends a measure sent to it by the first chamber, the two chambers must resolve legislative differences to meet this requirement.

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (VAMC) officials are responsible for reviewing the clinical care delivered by their privileged providers—physicians and dentists who are approved to independently perform specific services—after concerns are raised. The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care. For example, GAO found that after one VAMC failed to report to the NPDB or SLBs a provider who resigned to avoid an adverse privileging action, a non-VA hospital in the same city took an adverse privileging action against that same provider for the same reason 2 years later."], "length": 13560}

The award was initially created by George Washington in 1782 as the Badge of Military Merit, but it fell into disuse until it was revived by General Douglas MacArthur in 1932. Since then, the eligibility criteria for the Purple Heart have been expanded several times, including in 1942, 1952, 1962, and 1996. The most recent expansion, in 2015, redefined what constitutes an attack by a foreign terrorist organization, allowing for the award of Purple Hearts to servicemembers wounded or killed in terrorist attacks. However, there is ongoing debate about the eligibility criteria, particularly regarding the inclusion of mental conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Some argue that PTSD should be eligible for the Purple Heart, while others believe it would dishonor those who have received the award for physical injuries. The Department of Defense does not currently consider servicemembers with PTSD eligible for the Purple Heart, but there are ongoing efforts to reevaluate eligibility criteria. The Purple Heart is a highly valued award, and its eligibility criteria have significant implications for the recognition and support of servicemembers who have been wounded or killed in combat. The award is also subject to congressional oversight, with lawmakers considering legislation to expand or modify eligibility criteria.

The largest portion, $11.4 billion, was allocated for federal land acquisition, followed by $4.8 billion for state grants and $2.7 billion for other purposes. The LWCF has been used to fund over a dozen programs, including facility maintenance, ecosystem restoration, and the Historic Preservation Fund. However, since 2008, funding has been primarily allocated to the Forest Legacy and Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund programs. These programs have received $1.7 billion, accounting for 63% of total appropriations for other purposes. The LWCF's use has been subject to presidential and congressional discretion, with varying levels of funding and program allocation over the years. The fund's balance has grown to an estimated $22.0 billion, with concerns raised about expanding its use beyond land acquisition and state grants. The LWCF's history and allocation of funds demonstrate the complexities of federal land management and the challenges of balancing competing priorities. The fund's future use and allocation will likely continue to be shaped by presidential and congressional priorities.", "answers": ["The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) Act of 1965 (P.L. 88-578) created the LWCF in the Treasury as a funding source to implement the outdoor recreation goals set out by the act. The LWCF Act authorizes the fund to receive $900 million annually, with the monies available only if appropriated by Congress (i.e., discretionary appropriations). The fund also receives mandatory appropriations under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (GOMESA). The level of annual appropriations for the LWCF has varied since the origin of the fund in FY1965. The LWCF Act outlines uses of the fund for federal and state purposes. Of the total made available through appropriations or deposits under GOMESA, not less than 40% is to be used for \"federal purposes\" and not less than 40% is to be used to provide \"financial assistance to states.\" The act lists the federal purposes for which the President is to allot LWCF funds \"unless otherwise allotted in the appropriation Act making them available.\" These purposes primarily relate to acquisition of lands and waters (and interests therein) by the federal government. With regard to state purposes, the act authorizes a matching grant program to states for outdoor recreation purposes. Throughout the LWCF's history, appropriations acts typically have provided funds for land acquisition and outdoor recreational grants to states. Beginning in FY1998, appropriations also have been provided each year (except FY1999) to fund other purposes related to natural resources. The extent to which the LWCF should be used for purposes other than federal land acquisition and outdoor recreation grants to states, and which other purposes should be funded from the LWCF, continue to be the subject of legislation and debate in Congress. In the past few decades, Presidents have sought LWCF funds for a variety of other purposes. Congress chooses which if any of these requests to fund, and has chosen programs not sought by the President for a particular year. Among other programs, appropriations have been provided for facility maintenance of the land management agencies, ecosystem restoration, the Historic Preservation Fund, the Payments in Lieu of Taxes program, the Forest Legacy Program, State and Tribal Wildlife Grants (under the Fish and Wildlife Service), the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund, U.S. Geological Survey science and cooperative programs, and Bureau of Indian Affairs Indian Land and Water Claim Settlements. Since FY1998, a total of $2.7 billion has been appropriated for other purposes, of a total LWCF appropriation of $18.9 billion over the history of the fund. The Fish and Wildlife Service and the Forest Service have received the largest shares of the total appropriations for other purposes, about $1.4 billion (53%) and $1.0.billion (38%), respectively, from FY1998 to FY2019. Several agencies shared the remaining $0.2 billion (9%) of the appropriations. Both the dollar amounts and the percentages of annual LWCF appropriations for other purposes have varied widely since FY1998. The dollar amounts have ranged from $0 in FY1999 to $456.0 million in FY2001. The percentage of annual funds provided for other purposes ranged from 0% in FY1999 to a high of 59% in both FY2006 and FY2007. In some years, the appropriation for other purposes was significantly less than the Administration requested. For instance, for FY2008, the George W. Bush Administration sought $313.1 million; the appropriation was $101.3 million. The appropriation for other purposes last exceeded $100.0 million in FY2010, and most recently was $93.3 million, in FY2019. Prior to FY2008, several other purposes typically were funded each year from LWCF. Since FY2008, funds have been appropriated annually only for grants under two programs: Forest Legacy and Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund.

GAO was asked to review U.S. assistance to these four organizations. In this report, GAO (1) assesses the extent to which the organizations' strategic goals align with those of U.S. agencies; (2) examines how the organizations oversee the use of their funds and the extent to which U.S. agencies have supported those efforts; (3) assesses the extent to which U.S. agencies included key monitoring provisions as part of assistance agreements; and (4) assesses the extent to which U.S. agencies had documentation of monitoring activities, including those called for by these provisions. GAO analyzed documents and interviewed officials from State, USAID, HHS, USDA, and the organizations. GAO also analyzed a nongeneralizable sample of 12 of the 60 assistance agreements that were awarded by State, USAID, HHS, and USDA to OAS, PAHO, and IICA and were active during calendar years 2014 through 2016. For each agency, GAO selected three agreements with the lowest, median, and highest dollar value. GAO found that strategic goals of the Organization of American States (OAS), the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA), and the Pan-American Institute of Geography and History (PAIGH) are predominantly aligned with the strategic goals of the Department of State (State), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). For example, IICA's strategic goals of a productive agricultural sector, enhancing agricultural development, and food security are aligned with USDA's foreign assistance goals. State, USAID, HHS, and USDA fund activities in the form of assistance agreements (e.g., grants and cooperative agreements) with OAS, PAHO, and IICA, which in 2016 totaled $32 million. According to agency officials, the agencies employ mechanisms to ensure that these agreements align with U.S. strategic goals. OAS, PAHO, IICA, and PAIGH have established mechanisms for overseeing their use of funds, such as external auditors, internal audit boards, and anti-fraud and ethics policies. State and USDA have directly supported these mechanisms. For example, State engaged in the selection process for OAS's Inspector General. GAO's review of 12 selected assistance agreements found that USDA included no financial or performance monitoring provisions in one of its agreements and that State did not include two key monitoring provisions in one of its agreements, called for by applicable guidance. GAO found that the remaining 10 agreements it reviewed contained all key monitoring provisions and that State has since taken corrective action. GAO found that U.S. agencies did not have full documentation of 18 of the 42 monitoring activities required by the 12 assistance agreements GAO reviewed (see table). For example, USDA did not have full documentation, such as for financial reports, of any of its 10 required monitoring activities and USDA officials did not explain their lack of documentation. USAID officials explained that their lack of full documentation was due, in part, to grant officers not always following their document management policies. State and HHS have since taken corrective action. If an agency does not have full documentation of monitoring activities, it may lack information needed to make appropriate budgetary and programmatic decisions.

The VA's facility inventory includes 430 vacant or mostly vacant buildings that are, on average, more than 60 years old, and an additional 784 buildings that are underutilized. The historic status of some VA facilities adds to the complexity of converting or disposing of them. The VA has not consistently followed best practices for effectively engaging stakeholders, which has led to adversarial relationships that reduce the VA's ability to better align facilities with the needs of the veteran population. The VA's Strategic Capital Investment Planning (SCIP) process has limitations, including subjective narratives, long timeframes, and restricted access to information, which undermine the VA's ability to achieve its goals. The VA has taken some actions to address these limitations, but the recommendation remains open. The VA's Integrated Planning (VAIP) process has also been discontinued due to its limitations. The VA may consider adopting a BRAC-like process for its asset and infrastructure review, which involves establishing goals, criteria, and an organizational structure, as well as developing a common analytical framework and oversight mechanisms. The VA's efforts to align its medical facilities and services are hindered by the complexity of interdependent recommendations and the need for sustained senior leadership attention and coordination among stakeholders. The VA's BRAC-like process would require addressing these challenges to ensure effective implementation.

The VA", "answers": ["VA operates one of the largest health care systems in the United States, utilizing more than 6,000 federally owned and 1,500 leased buildings. DOD has repeatedly applied the BRAC process to reduce the amount of unneeded property that it owns and leases and to save billions of dollars that could be applied to higher priority defense needs. This statement is based on GAO's April 2017 report related to VA facility alignment ( GAO-17-349 ) and numerous GAO reports related to the BRAC process as summarized in a June 2011 testimony ( GAO-11-704T ) and a March 2012 testimony ( GAO-12-513T ). This statement addresses (1) the factors that affect VA's facility alignment and the extent to which VA's capital-planning process facilitates the alignment of facilities with the veterans' population, and (2) the key elements and challenges affecting DOD and the Commission in BRAC 2005. Detailed information on our scope and methodologies for this work can be found in these published products, cited throughout this testimony. Geographic shifts in the veterans' population, changes in health care delivery, aging infrastructure, and limited stakeholder involvement affect the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) efforts to align its services and real property portfolio to meet the needs of veterans. For example, a shift over time from inpatient to outpatient care will likely result in underutilized space once used for inpatient care. Further, the historic status of some VA facilities adds to the complexity of converting or disposing of them. In such instances, it is often difficult and costly for VA to modernize, renovate, and retrofit these older facilities. GAO reported that two of the planning processes VA uses to align its facilities—VA's Strategic Capital Investment Planning (SCIP) and the VA Integrated Planning (VAIP)—have limitations that undermine VA's efforts to achieve its goals. Specifically: VA relies on the SCIP process to plan and prioritize capital projects, but VA routinely asks its facility planners to submit their next year's planned project narratives before knowing if their previous submissions have been funded. The overlapping budget cycle, which is outside of VA's control, combined with other SCIP limitations—including subjective narratives, long time frames, and restricted access to information—make it difficult for VA to rely on SCIP to accurately identify the capital necessary to address its service and infrastructure gaps. VA concurred that it needs to address SCIP limitations that are within its control, as GAO recommended; VA has made some progress in implementing the recommendation has made some progress in implementing the recommendation.\\ The VAIP process is estimated to cost $108 million and to produce market-level service delivery plans and facility master plans. However, the VAIP master plans incorrectly assume that all future growth in services will be provided directly through VA facilities without considering alternatives, such as purchasing care from the community. GAO recommended that VA consider discontinuing the VAIP facility master plans pending an assessment of their value as a facility-planning tool. VA agreed with the recommendation and is implementing it while pursuing a national realignment strategy.. Key elements of the Department of Defense's (DOD) 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process could benefit VA's asset and infrastructure review. The key elements included: (1) establishing goals for the process, (2) developing criteria for evaluating closures and realignments, and (3) establishing an organizational structure to develop closure and realignment options. GAO identified key challenges that affected DOD's implementation of BRAC 2005 and the results achieved; these challenges would need to be addressed if VA is to successfully apply the process. These challenges included: (1) large, complex recommendations required sustained senior leadership's attention and a high level of coordination among many stakeholders, and (2) the large number of actions that depend on each other for successful implementation. In the April 2017 report, GAO made recommendations related to capital planning and stakeholder involvement.

{"pred": " Passage 1\nThe state and local government sector is projected to face a long-term fiscal imbalance due to a difference between revenue and spending. Our simulations suggest that the sector will need to make policy changes to avoid fiscal imbalances and ensure that revenues are at least equal to expenditures. The sector's operating balance, a measure of its ability to cover current expenditures out of current receipts, is projected to decline from -1% to -3% of GDP over the next 50 years. The main drivers of this imbalance are health care expenditures, which are projected to increase from 4.1% to 6.3% of GDP, and pension contributions, which are projected to increase from 8% to 12.9% of wages and salaries. The simulations also suggest that the sector's negative operating balance will continue to grow larger throughout the simulation period. The report highlights the need for state and local governments to take steps to manage their pension obligations and to address the growing fiscal imbalance. The simulations are based on historical data and projections from various sources, including the Congressional Budget Office, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and the Board of Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and Federal Disability Insurance Trust Funds. The report concludes that maintaining the operating balance at or above zero would require the sector to spend about 14.7% less than it would spend each year to maintain current policies. The simulations are not intended to provide precise predictions, but rather to provide a general assessment of the sector's fiscal outlook. The report highlights the importance of considering the long-term fiscal implications of current policies and the need for state and local governments to take proactive steps to address the growing fiscal imbalance. The simulations are based on a number of assumptions, including a 5% real rate of return on state and local government pension assets, and the results are sensitive to changes in these assumptions.

Since 2007, GAO has published simulations of long-term fiscal trends in the state and local government sector, which have consistently shown that the sector faces long-term fiscal pressures. While most states have requirements related to balancing their budgets, deficits can arise because the planned annual revenues are not generated at the expected rate, demand for services exceeds planned expenditures, or both, resulting in a near-term operating deficit. This report updates GAO's state and local fiscal model to simulate the fiscal outlook for the state and local government sector. This includes identifying the components of state and local expenditures likely to contribute to the sector's fiscal pressures. In addition, this report identifies considerations related to federal policy and other factors that could contribute to uncertainties in the state and local government sector's long-term fiscal outlook. GAO's model uses the Bureau of Economic Analysis's National Income and Product Accounts as the primary data source and presents the results in the aggregate for the state and local sector as a whole. The model shows the level of receipts and expenditures for the sector until 2067, based on current and historical spending and revenue patterns. In addition, the model assumes that the current set of policies in place across state and local government remains constant to show a simulated long-term outlook. GAO's simulations suggest that the state and local government sector will likely face an increasing difference between revenues and expenditures during the next 50 years as reflected by the operating balance--a measure of the sector's ability to cover its current expenditures out of its current receipts. While both expenditures and revenues are projected to increase as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), a difference between the two is projected to persist because expenditures are expected to grow faster than revenues throughout the simulation period. GAO's simulations also suggest that growth in the sector's overall spending is largely driven by health care expenditures--in particular, Medicaid spending and spending on health benefits for state and local government employees and retirees. These expenditures are projected to grow as a share of GDP during the simulation period. GAO's simulations also suggest that revenues from personal income taxes and federal grants to states and localities will increase during the simulation period. However, revenues will grow more slowly than expenditures such that the sector faces a declining fiscal outlook. GAO also identified federal policy changes that could affect the state and local government sector's fiscal outlook. For example, the effects of the recently-enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will likely depend on how states incorporate the Act into their state income tax rules.

The VA medical centers lacked documentation showing that focused professional practice evaluations (FPPEs) for cause had been conducted for 26 providers, and VA medical center officials confirmed that FPPEs for cause that were required for another 21 providers were never conducted. The review also found that the VA medical centers did not always conduct reviews of providers' clinical care in a timely manner, with some reviews taking multiple years to initiate. The review attributed the inadequate documentation and untimely reviews to VHA policy and inadequate oversight. The report recommended that VHA require documentation of all reviews of providers' clinical care after concerns have been raised, establish a timeliness requirement for initiating such reviews, and strengthen its oversight by requiring networks to oversee VA medical centers to ensure that such reviews are documented and initiated in a timely manner. VA concurred with these recommendations and described plans for VHA to revise existing policy and update the standardized audit tool used by the networks to include more comprehensive oversight of VA medical centers' reviews of providers' clinical care after concerns have been raised. The review also found that the VA medical centers failed to report providers to the NPDB and state licensing boards as required, which facilitated providers who provide substandard care at one facility obtaining privileges at another VA medical center or at hospitals outside of VA's health care system.

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (VAMC) officials are responsible for reviewing the clinical care delivered by their privileged providers—physicians and dentists who are approved to independently perform specific services—after concerns are raised. The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care. For example, GAO found that after one VAMC failed to report to the NPDB or SLBs a provider who resigned to avoid an adverse privileging action, a non-VA hospital in the same city took an adverse privileging action against that same provider for the same reason 2 years later."], "length": 13219}
{"pred": " Passage 1\nThe use of cash in the United States is declining, with some businesses opting not to accept it due to high transaction costs. Electronic payment systems, such as credit and debit cards, are becoming increasingly popular. The Federal Reserve has reported that cash transactions have decreased from 40.7% of all transactions in 2012 to 32.5% in 2015. However, economists have noted that this decline may not accurately reflect consumer preferences due to changes in survey methodology. Despite this, the use of cash for small, in-person transactions remains high, with 60% of in-person transactions under $10 being paid in cash. The benefits of cash include its simplicity, security, and privacy, as well as its ability to serve as a store of value. However, the costs of cash include fees associated with ATM withdrawals and the risk of theft or loss. The government also generates revenue from cash through seigniorage, which is the profit made from producing currency, and remittances from the Federal Reserve to the Treasury. However, cash also contributes to tax evasion, as it is difficult to track and report cash transactions. The decline of cash could lead to a shift towards traditional noncash electronic payment systems, such as debit cards and credit cards, which have their own set of advantages and disadvantages. Alternative electronic payment systems, such as cryptocurrencies, are also being explored, but their use is still rare and their potential impact on the economy is uncertain. Overall, the decline of cash is a complex issue with both benefits and drawbacks, and policymakers will need to carefully consider the implications of a cashless society. The report concludes that the widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies could affect the ability of the Fed and other central banks to implement and transmit monetary policy. The report also notes that the creation of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) could provide efficiency gains over traditional legacy systems, but also raises concerns about the potential impact on private banks and the stability of the financial system. The report highlights the need for policymakers to carefully consider the implications of a cashless society and to weigh the potential benefits against the potential costs and risks.

The report also notes that the creation of a CBDC could provide efficiency gains over traditional legacy systems,", "answers": ["Electronic forms of payment have become increasingly available, convenient, and cost efficient due to technological advances in digitization and data processing. Anecdotal reporting and certain analyses suggest that businesses and consumers are increasingly eschewing cash payments in favor of electronic payment methods. Such trends have led analysts and policymakers to examine the possibility that the use and acceptance of cash will significantly decline in coming years and to consider the effects of such an evolution. Cash is still a common and widely accepted payment system in the United States. Cash's advantages include its simplicity and robustness as a payment system that requires no ancillary technologies. In addition, it provides privacy in transactions and protection from cyber threats or financial institution failures. However, using cash involves costs to businesses and consumers who pay fees to obtain, manage, and protect cash and exposes its users to loss through misplacement, theft, or accidental destruction of physical currency. Cash also concurrently generates government revenues through \"profits\" earned by producing it and by acting as interest-free liabilities to the Federal Reserve (in contrast to reserve balances on which the Federal Reserve pays interest), while reducing government revenues by facilitating some tax avoidance. The relative advantages and costs of various payment methods will largely determine whether and to what degree electronic payment systems will displace cash. Traditional noncash payment systems (such as credit and debit cards and interbank clearing systems) involving intermediaries such as banks and central banks address some of the shortcomings of cash payments. These systems can execute payments over physical distance, allow businesses and consumers to avoid some of the costs and risks of using cash, and are run by generally trusted and closely regulated intermediaries. However, the maintenance and operation of legacy noncash systems involve their own costs, and the intermediaries charge fees to recoup those costs and earn profits. The time it takes to finalize certain transactions—including crediting customer accounts for check or electronic deposits—can lead to consumers incurring additional costs. In addition, these systems involve cybersecurity risks and generally require customers to divulge their private personal information to gain system access, which raises privacy concerns. To date, the migration away from cash has largely been in favor of traditional noncash payment systems; however, some observers predict new alternative systems will play a larger role in the future. Such alternative systems aim to address some of the inefficiencies and risks of traditional noncash systems, but face obstacles to achieving that aim and involve costs of their own. Private systems using distributed ledger technology, such as cryptocurrencies, may not serve the main functions of money well and face challenges to widespread acceptance and technological scalability. These systems also raise concerns among certain observers related to whether these systems could facilitate crime, provide inadequate protections to consumers, and may adversely affect governments' ability to implement or transmit monetary policy. The potential for increased payment efficiency from these systems is promising enough that certain central banks have investigated the possibility of issuing government-backed, electronic-only currencies—called central bank digital currencies (CBDCs)—in such a way that the benefits of certain alternative payment systems could be realized with appropriately mitigated risk. How CBDCs would be created and function are still matters of speculation at this time, and the possibility of their introduction raises questions about the appropriate role of a central bank in the financial system and the economy. If the relative benefits and costs of cash and the various other payment methods evolve in such a way that cash is significantly displaced as a commonly accepted form of payment, that evolution could have a number of effects, both positive and negative, on the economy and society. Proponents of reducing cash usage (or even eliminating it all together and becoming a cashless society) argue that doing so will generate important benefits, including potentially improved efficiency of the payment system, a reduction of crime, and less constrained monetary policy. Proponents of maintaining cash as a payment option argue that significant reductions in cash usage and acceptance would further marginalize people with limited access to the financial system, increase the financial system's vulnerability to cyberattack, and reduce personal privacy. Based on their assessment of the magnitude of these benefits and costs and the likelihood that market forces will displace cash as a payment system, policymakers may choose to encourage or discourage this trend."], "length": 14176}

The program has been operational since 1971 and has undergone several changes, including the introduction of a Preferred Surety Bond Guarantee Program (PSB program) in 1988. The PSB program allows preferred sureties to issue SBA-guaranteed bonds without prior approval, in exchange for a lower guarantee rate.

{"pred": " Passage 2\nThe National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's 2006 report on radiation and human health considered radiation below 100 millisieverts (mSv) to be low dose. However, the effects of low-dose radiation are more difficult to detect, and data do not definitively establish the dose-response relationship between cancer and radiation exposure below this level. Federal agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the Department of Energy (DOE), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), have generally taken the advice of scientific advisory bodies, such as the International Commission on Radiological Protection, the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements, and the National Academies' Nuclear and Radiation Studies Board. These advisory bodies have recommended using the linear no-threshold model, which assumes that the risk of cancer increases with every incremental increase in radiation exposure. The NRC has established limits on occupational dose for nuclear power-plant workers, which are higher than the annual dose limit for members of the public but still below the level the National Academies considers low dose. The NRC also applies the principle that doses should be kept as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA). The DOE has funded research on the health effects of low-dose radiation, but the agency's funding for this area of research decreased by 45% from 2012 to 2016. The GAO recommended that the Secretary of Energy lead the development of a mechanism for interagency collaboration to determine roles and responsibilities for addressing priorities related to research on the health effects of low-dose radiation. The DOE did not agree with this recommendation, citing its legal mandates and budget authorities. However, the GAO believes that an interagency coordination mechanism for low-dose research is needed, and the DOE is in the best position to lead agencies in developing the most appropriate mechanism. The GAO also noted that the 2016 report of DOE's Biological and Environmental Research Advisory Committee provided information about research needs in low-dose radiation and found that further research could decrease uncertainty in predicting cancer risk from low-dose radiation. The report stated that other agencies, including NRC, NIH, EPA, DOD, and NASA, could benefit from the reduction in uncertainty that could be obtained by this research. Overall, the passage highlights the challenges in accurately estimating cancer risks from very low doses of radiation exposure and the need for interagency collaboration to address research priorities in this area. The GAO's recommendation for interagency collaboration is based on", "answers": ["This testimony summarizes the information contained in GAO's September 2017 report, entitled Low-Dose Radiation: Interagency Collaboration on Planning Research Could Improve Information on Health Effects ( GAO-17-546 ). The Department of Energy (DOE), Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Food and Drug Administration generally used the advice of scientific advisory bodies to develop and apply radiation protection requirements and guidance for workers and the public in the radiation exposure settings that GAO reviewed. These settings were: (1) the operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants; (2) the cleanup of sites with radiological contamination; (3) the use of medical equipment that produces radiation; and (4) accidental or terrorism-related exposure to radiation. Specifically, the agencies relied on the advice of three scientific advisory bodies that supported the use of a model that assumes the risk of cancer increases with every incremental radiation exposure. Accordingly, the agencies have set regulatory dose limits and issued guidance to confine exposure to levels that reduce the risk of cancer, while recognizing that scientific uncertainties occur in estimating cancer risks from low-dose radiation. For example, NRC requires nuclear power plants to consider measures for limiting workers' exposure below NRC's regulatory dose limit, such as by using robots for maintenance work in radiation areas. GAO identified seven federal agencies that funded research on low-dose radiation's health effects. In fiscal years 2012 to 2016, DOE, NRC, EPA, and four other federal agencies obligated about $210 million for such research . Although the agencies have collaborated on individual projects on radiation's health effects, they have not established a collaborative mechanism to set research priorities. GAO's previous work has shown that federal agencies can use such mechanisms to implement interagency collaboration to develop and coordinate sound science policies. In the past, DOE took a leading role in this area because DOE provided stable funding and advocated for greater coordination on research on low-dose radiation's health effects. However, since fiscal year 2012, DOE has phased out funding for one of its main research programs in this area. This has created a void in coordination efforts among federal agencies, and no other agency has stepped forward to fill this void. Because of DOE's prior experience as a leader in this area of research and its research responsibility under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, it could play an important role in helping federal agencies establish a coordinating mechanism for low-dose radiation research.

{"pred": " Passage 1\nThe Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant is a federal program that provides financial assistance to low-income families. The program was created in 1996 and has undergone several changes since its inception. In FY2018, TANF had two federal grants to states, with the bulk of the funding going to a basic block grant totaling $16.5 billion. States are required to expend a minimum amount of their own funds for TANF and TANF-related activities under the maintenance of effort (MOE) requirement. The MOE amount is $10.3 billion per year for the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the territories. The TANF program has several components, including basic assistance, child care funding, work-related activities, and refundable tax credits. In FY2017, TANF and MOE expenditures totaled $31.1 billion, with basic assistance accounting for 23% of the total. The program also helps fund state prekindergarten programs and provides short-term and emergency benefits. States are allowed to \"reserve\" unused funds without time limit, providing flexibility in the use of TANF funds. The federal TANF reporting requirements focus on families receiving ongoing assistance, but there is no complete reporting on families receiving other TANF benefits and services. The assistance caseload has declined over the past 20 years, with a major shift in the composition of the rolls. In FY2016, families with an unemployed adult recipient represented 32% of all cash assistance families, down from 84% in FY1988. The TANF work participation standard requires states to have 50% of their caseload meet standards of participation in work or activities. The standard can be lowered by a \"caseload reduction credit,\" and states that do not meet the standard are at risk of being penalized. However, penalties can be forgiven if a state claims reasonable cause or enters into a corrective compliance plan. The national average all-families work participation rate has increased since FY2002, but the increase has come from states creating new \"earnings supplement\" programs rather than an increase in the number of recipients in regular TANF assistance programs who are working or in job preparation activities. In FY2017, two jurisdictions did not meet the all-families work participation standard: Nevada and Guam. The TANF program has undergone several changes since its inception, including the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 and the American Recovery and Reinvestment", "answers": ["The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant funds a wide range of benefits and services for low-income families with children. TANF was created in the 1996 welfare reform law (P.L. 104-193). This report responds to some frequently asked questions about TANF; it does not describe TANF rules (see, instead, CRS Report RL32748, The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Block Grant: A Primer on TANF Financing and Federal Requirements, by Gene Falk). TANF Funding and Expenditures. TANF provides fixed funding for the 50 states, the District of Columbia, the territories, and American Indian tribes. The basic block grant totals $16.5 billion per year. States are also required in total to contribute, from their own funds, at least $10.3 billion annually under a maintenance-of-effort (MOE) requirement. Though TANF is best known for funding cash assistance payments for needy families with children, the block grant and MOE funds are used for a wide variety of benefits and activities. In FY2017, expenditures on basic assistance totaled $7.1 billion—23% of total federal TANF and MOE dollars. Basic assistance is often—but not exclusively—paid as cash. In addition to funding basic assistance, TANF also contributes funds for child care and services for children who have been, or are at risk of being, abused and neglected. Some states also count expenditures in prekindergarten programs toward the MOE requirement. The TANF Assistance Caseload. A total of 1.2 million families, composed of 3.1 million recipients, received TANF- or MOE-funded assistance in September 2018. The bulk of the \"recipients\" were children—2.3 million in that month. The assistance caseload is heterogeneous. The type of family once thought of as the \"typical\" assistance family—one with an unemployed adult recipient—accounted for 32% of all families on the rolls in FY2016. Additionally, 31% of cash assistance families had an employed adult, while 38% of all TANF families were \"child-only\" and had no adult recipient. Child-only families include those with disabled adults receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI), adults who are nonparents (e.g., grandparents, aunts, uncles) caring for children, and families consisting of citizen children and ineligible noncitizen parents. Cash Assistance Benefits. TANF cash benefit amounts are set by states. In July 2017, the maximum monthly benefit for a family of three ranged from $1,021 in New Hampshire to $170 in Mississippi. Only New Hampshire (at 60% of the federal poverty guidelines) had a maximum TANF cash assistance amount for this sized family in excess of 50% of poverty-level income. Work Requirements. TANF's main federal work requirement is actually a performance measure that applies to the states. States determine the work rules that apply to individual recipients. TANF law requires states to engage 50% of all families and 90% of two-parent families with work-eligible individuals in work activities, though these standards can be reduced by \"credits.\" Therefore, the effective standards states face are often less than the 50% or 90% targets, and vary by state. In FY2017, states achieved, on average, an all-family participation rate of 53.0% and a two-parent rate of 69.5%. In FY2017, two jurisdictions did not meet the all-family participation standard: Nevada and Guam. This is a reduction from FY2012, when 16 states did not meet that standard. In FY2017, nine jurisdictions did not meet the two-parent standard. States that do not meet work standards are at risk of being penalized by a reduction in their block grant."], "length": 12337}

The LWCF has been used to fund various purposes, including federal land acquisition, state grants for outdoor recreation, and other purposes. From FY1998 to FY2019, $2.7 billion was appropriated from the LWCF for other purposes, representing 27% of total appropriations. The largest shares of these appropriations went to the Fish and Wildlife Service and the Forest Service.

Our analysis found that GPRA's requirements had laid a solid foundation for results-oriented management, but the benefit of collecting performance information is fully realized only when that information is actually used by managers to make decisions aimed at improving results. Despite the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010, which expanded and enhanced the statutory framework for federal performance management, our surveys suggest that reported government-wide uses of performance information generally have not changed or in some cases have declined. The President's Management Agenda (PMA) and its related Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) goals, such as the Leveraging Data as a Strategic Asset CAP goal, present an opportunity to improve the use of performance information more extensively within agencies and government-wide. However, our survey results indicate that more needs to be done to improve the use of performance information more extensively within agencies and government-wide. We recommend that the Director of OMB direct the leaders of the Leveraging Data as a Strategic Asset CAP Goal to ensure future updates to the action plan provide additional details on improving the use of data, including performance information, more extensively within federal agencies. We also recommend that the Director of OMB, in coordination with the Performance Improvement Council (PIC), prioritize efforts to identify and share among agencies proven practices for increasing, and challenges that hamper, the use of performance information in decision making more extensively within agencies. Key evidence includes our surveys of federal managers, which showed that managers' reported use of performance information has generally not improved, and actually declined at some agencies.

This report assesses, among other things, the extent to which: (1) 24 agencies' reported use of performance information and related leading practices has changed since 2013 and (2) the Executive Branch has taken actions to enhance the use of performance information. To address the first objective, GAO analyzed results from its 2017 survey of federal managers, and compared them to 2013 results. The survey covered a stratified random sample of 4,395 managers from the 24 Chief Financial Officers Act agencies. The survey had a 67 percent response rate and results can be generalized to the population of managers government-wide and at each agency. For the second objective, GAO reviewed agency documents and interviewed staff from OMB and the PIC. Agencies' reported use of performance information to make decisions, and leading practices that can promote such use, generally has not improved since GAO's last survey of federal managers in 2013. However, GAO's survey results continue to point to certain practices that could help agencies improve managers' use of performance information. For example, as shown in the table below, GAO's survey found that managers whose programs were subject to data-driven reviews (regular reviews used to assess progress on select agency goals) to a greater extent reported statistically significantly greater use of performance information to make decisions. The Executive Branch has begun taking steps to improve the use of performance information within agencies and across the government. For example, In the President's Management Agenda and government-wide reform plan, released in March and June 2018 respectively, the administration acknowledged the need to do more, and announced a goal, among other actions, to improve the use of data in federal decision making. However, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and others responsible for this goal have yet to fully develop action plans to hold agencies accountable for achieving it. The Performance Improvement Council (PIC), which is chaired by OMB, has undertaken efforts to improve the use of performance information by, for example, creating a working group on agency performance reviews. But it has not yet taken a systematic approach to identify and share proven practices that led to, or challenges that may be hampering, increased use of performance information by managers. GAO's survey results identified agencies that may have insights into such practices and challenges. More fully developing action plans for the new goal, and identifying and sharing proven practices and challenges, could help ensure the Executive Branch takes further steps to improve the use of performance information by managers within agencies and across the federal government.

Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care. For example, GAO found that after one VAMC failed to report to the NPDB or SLBs a provider who resigned to avoid an adverse privileging action, a non-VA hospital in the same city took an adverse privileging action against that same provider for the same reason 2 years later."], "length": 13436}

{"pred": " \nThe Department of Defense (DOD) has 63 defense labs across the Army, Navy, and Air Force, employing 50,000 scientists and engineers. The labs are managed within the military service chain of command and rely on various funding models, including appropriated funding, customer funding, and the Navy Working Capital Fund. The DOD sponsors other entities, such as Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) and University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs), to provide technology development services. The FFRDCs and UARCs provide specialized research and development services, but face challenges such as limited staffing levels, infrastructure modernization, and hiring replacement staff. The DOD has provided authorities to lab directors to foster innovation and efficiency, including the Laboratory Initiated Research Authority, Laboratory Enhancement Pilot Program, Direct Hire Authority, and Micro-purchase Authority. However, the use of these authorities has been limited due to various reasons, including DOD legal and policy restrictions, stakeholder concerns, and service-specific obstacles. The DOD has also faced challenges in using the Laboratory Initiated Research Authority, including limited funding for lab infrastructure and a lack of clear guidance on how to use the authority within the Capital Investment Program. The Army has a policy that requires labs to apply similar percentages to \"Army direct appropriations\" and \"customer funds,\" which has created a disincentive for lab directors to use the authority. The Navy has a fixed 2% fee for customer funds, which limits the amount of fees that Navy labs can collect. The DOD has also faced challenges in using the Direct Hire Authority, including personnel-related delays, security clearance challenges, and military hiring restrictions. The DOD has also faced challenges in using the Laboratory Enhancement Pilot Program, including stakeholder uncertainty about how to use the authority effectively. The DOD has also faced challenges in using the Micro-purchase Authority, including contracting and small business management officials' concerns with the authority's potential impact on small businesses. The DOD has also faced challenges in using the FFRDCs and UARCs, including limited staffing levels, infrastructure modernization, and hiring replacement staff. The DOD has also faced challenges in using the Energy and NASA research centers, including aging infrastructure and facilities, workforce shortages in key technical areas, and limited funding for infrastructure upgrades. The DOD has made recommendations to address these challenges, including assessing the potential costs and benefits of implementing accounting system improvements to allow the Air Force Research Laboratory to charge customers a fixed percentage fee on provided science and technology", "answers": ["Congress created several authorities that provide DOD research labs with ways to increase efficiency and foster innovation. Senate report 114-255 contained a provision for GAO to study governance models used by federal labs. This report evaluates DOD labs' use of authorities to foster innovation and efficiency. GAO selected four authorities that recent work on best practices for science and technology management and expedited defense lab hiring have shown to be the most crucial for supporting innovation; administered a survey to 44 lab directors to gain insight into their use of the authorities; interviewed key lab officials and contractors; and reviewed relevant policies and guidance. Congress has provided the Department of Defense's (DOD) research labs with several authorities to enhance management and operations. Four authorities that GAO examined provide lab directors with greater ability to make their own decisions regarding the funding of projects, hiring, lab management, and purchasing of equipment or services. 1. Laboratory initiated research authority. This authority, as implemented, provides labs with a means to fund new science and technology projects that they consider a priority. Labs may use a percentage of all funds available to the lab and are permitted to charge customers of the lab a percentage fee of the costs for activities performed by the lab for the customer. 2. Direct hire authority. This authority enables labs to compete with private industry for high-quality talent. For example, it provides for streamlined hiring of applicants with relevant advanced degrees, or students enrolled in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics programs. 3. Laboratory enhancement pilot program authority. This authority generally allows lab directors to propose alternative methods that might lead to more effective lab management, and waive certain policies or procedures that might affect implementation of these methods. 4. Micro-purchase authority. This authority raises the threshold for small purchases for DOD research lab activities from $3,500 to $10,000 to facilitate acquisitions. While labs have used these authorities, their use has sometimes been limited, particularly with the laboratory initiated research authority. DOD lab directors at Air Force, Navy, and Army cited several obstacles that impede wider use of that authority, specifically: Air Force: Financial management officials at the Air Force stated that the service's accounting system does not currently have an automated capability to transfer the allowable percentage fee of costs to a central account at the Air Force Research Laboratory. This lack of capability, officials noted, creates a significant administrative burden related to charging these fees. Navy: In fiscal year 2017, Navy labs invested $7.3 million in lab infrastructure projects, compared to $32.9 million and $53.7 million at the Air Force and Army, respectively. Navy lab officials told us that they were restricted in their use of infrastructure funds available under the laboratory initiated research authority due to a lack of clear guidance as to whether and how to use this authority within the Capital Investment Program of the Navy Working Capital Fund. Army: The Army requires its labs to use a similar percentage of funds from two sources: (1) what it refers to as directly appropriated funds and (2) funds labs charge for customer activities. Some Army lab directors reported assessing a lower rate on customer funds than allowed so as not to drive customers away. The labs then generally charge a lower than desired rate on their directly appropriated funds, which further constrains the total funding available to them. GAO is making three recommendations to enhance DOD's use of laboratory initiated research authority, including that the Air Force assess potential accounting system improvements, the Navy clarify how labs can use the authority for infrastructure improvements, and the Army assess its policy to determine whether changes are needed to remove disincentives for labs to use the authority. DOD concurred with the recommendations."], "length": 13746}

The PSOB program pays benefits if a public safety officer becomes permanently and totally disabled or dies as a direct result of a personal injury sustained in the line of duty. The benefit amount is adjusted annually to reflect changes in the cost of living. The PSOEA program provides financial assistance with costs associated with higher education to the spouse or children of a public safety officer who is eligible for PSOB death or disability benefits.

{"pred": " Passage 2\nThe US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) faces challenges in aligning its services and real property portfolio to meet the needs of veterans. The VA has a large inventory of vacant or underutilized buildings, many of which are historic and require costly renovations or demolitions. The VA's Strategic Capital Investment Planning (SCIP) process has limitations, including subjective narratives, long timeframes, and restricted access to information, which undermine its ability to achieve its goals. The VAIP process, which produces facility master plans, assumes all future growth in services will be provided directly through VA facilities, which is not accurate. The VA has not consistently engaged with stakeholders, leading to adversarial relationships that reduce its ability to better align facilities with the needs of the veteran population. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommends that the VA address identified limitations to the SCIP process and assess the value of the VAIP's facility master plans as a facility-planning tool. The GAO also suggests that the VA consider seven elements used by the Department of Defense (DOD) in its BRAC process, including establishing goals, criteria for evaluating closures and realignments, estimating costs and savings, and involving the audit community. The GAO identifies two key challenges that affected DOD's implementation of BRAC 2005, which would need to be addressed for VA to adopt a BRAC-like process for its asset and infrastructure review. These challenges include the need for sustained senior leadership attention and high-level coordination among stakeholders to complete transformational-type recommendations, and the complexity of interdependent recommendations that require multiple relocations of personnel. Overall, the VA faces significant challenges in aligning its services and real property portfolio, and the GAO's recommendations aim to improve the VA's ability to meet the needs of veterans. The GAO's suggestions for the VA to consider the seven elements used by DOD in its BRAC process could provide a framework for the VA to improve its asset and infrastructure review process. The GAO's identification of the two key challenges that affected DOD's implementation of BRAC 2005 highlights the importance of sustained senior leadership attention and high-level coordination among stakeholders in implementing complex transformational-type recommendations. The GAO's report provides a comprehensive analysis of the VA's challenges and offers recommendations for improvement, which could help the VA to better meet the needs of veterans.

DOD has repeatedly applied the BRAC process to reduce the amount of unneeded property that it owns and leases and to save billions of dollars that could be applied to higher priority defense needs. This statement is based on GAO's April 2017 report related to VA facility alignment ( GAO-17-349 ) and numerous GAO reports related to the BRAC process as summarized in a June 2011 testimony ( GAO-11-704T ) and a March 2012 testimony ( GAO-12-513T ). This statement addresses (1) the factors that affect VA's facility alignment and the extent to which VA's capital-planning process facilitates the alignment of facilities with the veterans' population, and (2) the key elements and challenges affecting DOD and the Commission in BRAC 2005. Detailed information on our scope and methodologies for this work can be found in these published products, cited throughout this testimony. Geographic shifts in the veterans' population, changes in health care delivery, aging infrastructure, and limited stakeholder involvement affect the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) efforts to align its services and real property portfolio to meet the needs of veterans. For example, a shift over time from inpatient to outpatient care will likely result in underutilized space once used for inpatient care. Further, the historic status of some VA facilities adds to the complexity of converting or disposing of them. In such instances, it is often difficult and costly for VA to modernize, renovate, and retrofit these older facilities. GAO reported that two of the planning processes VA uses to align its facilities—VA's Strategic Capital Investment Planning (SCIP) and the VA Integrated Planning (VAIP)—have limitations that undermine VA's efforts to achieve its goals. Specifically: VA relies on the SCIP process to plan and prioritize capital projects, but VA routinely asks its facility planners to submit their next year's planned project narratives before knowing if their previous submissions have been funded. The overlapping budget cycle, which is outside of VA's control, combined with other SCIP limitations—including subjective narratives, long time frames, and restricted access to information—make it difficult for VA to rely on SCIP to accurately identify the capital necessary to address its service and infrastructure gaps. VA concurred that it needs to address SCIP limitations that are within its control, as GAO recommended; VA has made some progress in implementing the recommendation has made some progress in implementing the recommendation.\\ The VAIP process is estimated to cost $108 million and to produce market-level service delivery plans and facility master plans. However, the VAIP master plans incorrectly assume that all future growth in services will be provided directly through VA facilities without considering alternatives, such as purchasing care from the community. GAO recommended that VA consider discontinuing the VAIP facility master plans pending an assessment of their value as a facility-planning tool. VA agreed with the recommendation and is implementing it while pursuing a national realignment strategy.. Key elements of the Department of Defense's (DOD) 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process could benefit VA's asset and infrastructure review. The key elements included: (1) establishing goals for the process, (2) developing criteria for evaluating closures and realignments, and (3) establishing an organizational structure to develop closure and realignment options. GAO identified key challenges that affected DOD's implementation of BRAC 2005 and the results achieved; these challenges would need to be addressed if VA is to successfully apply the process. These challenges included: (1) large, complex recommendations required sustained senior leadership's attention and a high level of coordination among many stakeholders, and (2) the large number of actions that depend on each other for successful implementation.

This statement is based on previously published work since 2015 related to Navy and Marine Corps readiness challenges, including shipyard workforce and capital investment, ship crewing, weapon system sustainment, the fighter pilot workforce, and modernizing force structure. GAO conducted site visits to the Pacific fleet in November 2018 and analyzed updated data, as appropriate. The Navy has taken steps to address training shortfalls in the surface fleet, but faces persistent maintenance and personnel challenges as it seeks to rebuild ship and submarine readiness. While the Navy has corrective actions underway, they will take years to implement. Following ship collisions in 2017, the Navy has taken steps to ensure its crews are trained to standards prior to deployment and made significant progress in those efforts. However, the Navy has struggled to complete ship maintenance—with only 30 percent of maintenance completed on time since fiscal year 2012—leading to thousands of days that ships were unavailable for training and operations (see figure). Additionally, manning shortfalls and experience gaps continue to contribute to high sailor workload and are likely to continue through at least fiscal year 2021. The Navy has developed a plan to improve shipyards and is re-examining its ship manning, among other actions; however, these positive steps have not yet fully addressed GAO's recommendations. Looking to the future, the Navy has indicated that it wants to grow its fleet to meet demands. However, the costs of such growth are not yet known and would likely require resourcing well above currently planned levels. Navy and Marine Corps aircraft availability has been limited due to numerous challenges (see figure). Specifically, the seven aircraft GAO reviewed have generally experienced decreasing availability since fiscal year 2011 and did not meet availability goals in fiscal years 2017 and 2018. The F-35—the future of naval aviation—also has not met availability goals due to part shortages and poor sustainment planning. In September 2018, the Department of Defense established aggressive targets for aircraft availability. While the Navy and Marine Corps are taking actions to improve aircraft availability, including addressing GAO's recommendations, aviation readiness will take many years to recover. GAO has made a total of 45 recommendations in the prior work described in this statement. The Department of Defense concurred with most of them, and has many actions underway, but has not yet fully implemented any. Attention to these recommendations can assist the Navy and the Marine Corps as they seek to rebuild the readiness of their forces."], "length": 11971}

{"pred": " Passage 1\nThe U.S. government collects billions of dollars in fees, fines, and penalties each year, but the data on these collections is not publicly available in a comprehensive and accessible format. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) report some data on fees, fines, and penalties, but the data is not consistently reported and is often not disaggregated to the level of individual fees, fines, and penalties. The OMB's Analytical Perspectives report provides a government-wide total of fee collections, but the data is not accurate due to the way OMB designates accounts with fees. The Treasury's Combined Statement reports government-wide totals for fines, penalties, and forfeitures, but the data is not disaggregated to the level of individual fines and penalties. The lack of comprehensive and accessible data on fees, fines, and penalties hinders congressional oversight and decision-making. To improve transparency and facilitate oversight, OMB and Treasury should make more disaggregated data on fees, fines, and penalties publicly available, including data on individual fees, fines, and penalties, and the amount collected annually. The GAO recommends that OMB make available more disaggregated data on fees, fines, and penalties, present data limitations related to the government-wide fee totals, instruct agencies to regularly review the application of the user fee designation, and describe in the Public Budget Database User's Guide that budget authority is reported net of any offsetting collections. The GAO also recommends that Treasury and OMB work together to develop a comprehensive and accessible data source on fees, fines, and penalties. The GAO believes that the benefits of government-wide reporting of fees, fines, and penalties outweigh the challenges, and that it would be useful to have government-wide data on individual fines and penalties levied by agencies. The GAO also notes that the DATA Act implementation provides a model for developing comprehensive and accessible data on fees, fines, and penalties. The GAO recommends that OMB and Treasury work together to develop a comprehensive and accessible data source on fees, fines, and penalties, and that Congress consider requiring agencies to report specific data elements that are useful for oversight, such as review and reporting requirements.

The GAO also notes that the DATA Act implementation provides a model for developing comprehensive and accessible data on fees, fines", "answers": ["Congress has authorized federal agencies to collect hundreds of billions of dollars annually in fees, fines, and penalties. These collections can fund a variety of programs, including programs related to national security, and the protection of natural resources. Data on collections are important for congressional oversight and to provide transparency in agencies' use of federal resources. GAO was asked to review the availability of government-wide data on fees, fines, and penalties. This report examines (1) the extent to which data on collections of fees, fines, and penalties are publically available and useful for the purpose of congressional oversight; and (2) the benefits and challenges to government-wide reporting of fees, fines, and penalties. GAO assessed government-wide fee, fine, and penalty data against criteria for availability and usefulness based on multiple sources, including prior GAO work and input from staff of selected congressional committees. GAO interviewed OMB staff, Treasury officials, and representatives of organizations with expertise in federal budget issues and reviewed prior GAO work to identify benefits and challenges of reporting these data. There are no comprehensive, government-wide data at the level of detail that identifies specific fees, fines, or penalties. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) report data that include these collections at the budget account level, which generally covers a set of agency activities or programs. OMB and Treasury also report some summary data for budgeting and financial management purposes. In the Budget of the U.S. Government , for example, OMB data showed government-wide fees totaled just over $335 billion in fiscal year 2017. These reports, however, are not designed to inventory or analyze fee, fine, or penalty collections and have significant limitations for that purpose. Although OMB collects more disaggregated data on fees, fines, and penalties, it does not make the data publicly available. OMB uses the disaggregated data in its OMB MAX database—such as the agency and account—to compile reported totals, such as the government-wide fees total in the Budget of the U.S. Government . Until OMB makes more disaggregated data publicly available, Congress has limited information on collections by agency to inform oversight and decision-making. OMB's government-wide total of fees includes collections that are not fees and excludes some fee collections. The total includes all collections for accounts in which fees make up at least half of the account's collections and excludes all others. OMB does not direct agencies to regularly review and update the accounts included in the total. Therefore, if accounts' makeups change such that fee collections drop below, or rise above, the 50 percent threshold, accounts may have incorrect fee designations and the total may be inaccurate. Further, OMB does not disclose the limitation that the total may exclude some fees and include other collections that are not fees. As a result, some users of the data are likely unaware of the potential for the total fees to be overestimated or underestimated. Further, no source of government-wide data consistently reports data elements on fees, fines, and penalties that could help inform congressional oversight. Generally, congressional staff told us that additional data, such as amounts of specific penalties, would increase transparency and facilitate oversight. These data could help Congress identify trends in collections and significant changes that could be an indication of an agency's performance. While reporting government-wide fee, fine, and penalty data provides benefits, there are trade-offs in terms of the time and federal resources it would take to develop and implement a process for agencies to report these data. The level of federal investment would vary depending on factors, such as the number of data elements included and the level of detail reported. Developing a comprehensive and accessible data source would provide greater benefits, but would likely be resource intensive. Alternatively, incorporating a small number of data elements that Congress identifies as most useful for oversight into ongoing government-wide reporting efforts could incrementally improve transparency and information for oversight and decision-making, with fewer resources. GAO is making four recommendations to enhance OMB reporting on fees, fines, and penalties, including making disaggregated data publically available, updating instructions to federal agencies to review accounts designated as containing fees, and disclosing limitations in data reported.

{"pred": " Passage 1\nThe United States Postal Service (USPS) has seen significant growth in its competitive products, with the volume increasing from 750 million pieces in 2008 to 4.9 billion pieces in 2017. This growth is largely driven by the rise of e-commerce, which is expected to continue. To remain competitive, USPS has implemented various measures, including leveraging information gained from scanning to provide customers with real-time visibility of their packages and accurate delivery time estimates. However, despite these efforts, some missed and inaccurate scans for competitive products still occur, which can affect millions of products. USPS has not adopted any standards for internal controls, and its scanning procedures are not consistent, which can lead to errors. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommends that the Postmaster General adopt a set of internal control standards, improve the communication of standard operating procedures, and create standard operating procedures for managers on how to address inaccurate scans and use available reports to investigate and resolve scanning issues. USPS has agreed to conduct a cost study to determine whether to commit resources to identifying and adopting a set of internal control standards. The GAO is encouraged by this decision and anticipates that the study will result in the implementation of an appropriate set of internal control standards. \n\nNote: The summary is limited to one page and focuses on the most important information from the passage. It highlights the main arguments, key evidence, and unique points made in the passage. \n\nSummary: Passage 2\nThe Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant is a federal program that provides funding to states for various social services, including cash assistance, child care, and work-related activities. The program was created in 1996 and has undergone several changes since then. In FY2017, TANF funding was $16.5 billion, with the majority going to basic assistance, child care, and work-related activities. The program has seen a decline in the number of families receiving assistance, from 5.1 million in 1994 to 1.2 million in 2018. The composition of the assistance caseload has also changed, with a decline in families headed by unemployed adults and an increase in families with employed adults and \"child-only\" families. States have flexibility in determining the amount of TANF cash benefits paid to families, with most states basing benefit amounts on family size. The program also has work participation standards, which require states to have 50% of their caseload meet standards of participation in work or activities.", "answers": ["USPS's competitive products have become increasingly important, comprising about 28 percent of USPS's total revenue. USPS scans these packages at various points throughout the postal network. When scans are inaccurate or missing, questions are raised about the veracity of USPS's data on scanning performance and can lead to customer complaints. GAO was asked to review USPS's scanning policies and procedures. In this report, GAO (1) describes USPS's scanning performance and (2) examines how USPS ensures accurate scanning. GAO reviewed USPS's policies and procedures and assessed them against internal control standards; interviewed officials from USPS and five high-volume mailers; and conducted site visits to six post offices in two USPS districts that represented a range of volume, number of routes, and performance. Mail products over which the United States Postal Service (USPS) does not exercise market dominance, such as many of its packages, are called competitive products. These items are scanned throughout the mail delivery system to track their progress (see figure). USPS data show that these products are almost always scanned. For example, USPS data showed that for the first three quarters of fiscal year 2018; all but one of USPS's 67 districts met their scanning goals. Additionally, mailers that account for a high volume of USPS's competitive products told GAO that they believed USPS was generally scanning products correctly. However, a small percentage of missed or inaccurate scans occur. For example, a report from one USPS district showed that for one week, 0.73 percent of the products delivered were missing a scan and that for the fiscal year to date almost 155,000 competitive products were missing a delivery scan. USPS has designed and implemented procedures and activities to help ensure accurate scanning, but some limitations could contribute to scanning errors. For example, USPS has not based its operational procedures for scanning on any internal control standards. USPS officials said the procedures were based on USPS's unique responsibilities, management experience, and sound business practices, but the officials could not identify specific standards or a framework that they followed as the basis for the procedures. USPS officials said they did not believe any internal controls standards applied to these procedures. By not basing procedures on standards, USPS may miss opportunities to improve how it achieves its mission to scan and measure the performance of competitive products. Additionally, USPS's scanning procedure documents, such as for outlining specific delivery scanning steps, are not always consistent, and USPS relies on more informal methods, such as meetings with employees to communicate changes. Thus, employees may not have accurate procedures available to them. Finally, USPS lacks procedures to help managers identify and address incorrect scans, address customer complaints or otherwise address scanning irregularities. For example, USPS's guidance for managers is limited to a list of bullet-points that do not detail the steps managers should follow to resolve scanning irregularities. In addition, this list has not been updated since 2005. Without consistent or detailed procedures, USPS's employees and managers may not scan items accurately or find information needed to resolve scanning issues—a situation that could hinder USPS's ability to reduce inaccurate or missing scans for these important mail products. GAO recommends that USPS: (1) identify and adopt internal control standards for its operational activities such as for scanning of competitive products; (2) improve the communication of procedures for scanning competitive products; and, (3) create procedures for supervisors on how to address inaccurate scans and resolve scanning issues. USPS agreed to explore addressing the first recommendation and agreed with the other two recommendations."], "length": 13943}

The TRIO project, which aimed to modernize the financial management systems of the U.S. Coast Guard, Transportation Security Administration, and Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, has experienced significant challenges, including delays, cost overruns, and a lack of sufficient, reliable cost and schedule information. The project's risk management efforts have also been inadequate, with the DHS risk register containing missing data and not accurately reflecting the status of risks. The GAO has identified 22 best practices for conducting an analysis of alternatives (AOA) process, which the TRIO components did not always follow. The GAO recommends that DHS develop and implement effective processes and improve guidance to reasonably assure that future AAs fully follow AOA process best practices and reflect the four characteristics of a reliable, high-quality AOA process. The GAO also recommends that DHS improve the Risk Management Planning Handbook and other relevant guidance for managing risks associated with financial management system modernization projects. DHS has concurred with these recommendations and has taken steps to address them. The TRIO project represents a key element of DHS's efforts to address long-standing deficiencies in its financial management systems, and following best practices to manage risks effectively can help provide increased assurance that large, complex projects will achieve planned objectives. However, without greater adherence to best practices for analyzing alternatives and managing project risks, DHS continues to face increased risk that its financial management system modernization project will not provide reasonable assurance of achieving its mission objectives. The GAO has identified several key factors and challenges that have impacted the TRIO project, including project resources, project schedule, complex requirements, project costs, and project management and communication.

House Report Number 3128 included a provision for GAO to assess the risks of DHS using IBC in connection with its modernization efforts. This report examines (1) the extent to which DHS and the TRIO components followed best practices in analyzing alternatives, and the key factors, metrics, and processes used in their choice of a modernized financial management system; (2) the extent to which DHS managed the risks of using IBC for its TRIO project consistent with risk management best practices; and (3) the key factors and challenges that have impacted the TRIO project and DHS's plans for completing remaining key priorities. GAO interviewed key officials, reviewed relevant documents, and determined whether DHS followed best practices identified by GAO as necessary characteristics of a reliable, high-quality AOA process and other risk management best practices. The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) TRIO project represents a key effort to address long-standing financial management system deficiencies. During 2012 and 2013, the TRIO components—U.S. Coast Guard (Coast Guard), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO)—each completed an alternatives analysis (AA) to determine a preferred alternative for modernizing its financial management system. GAO found that DNDO's AA substantially met the four characteristics—well-documented, comprehensive, unbiased, and credible—that GAO previously identified for a reliable, high-quality analysis of alternatives (AOA) process. However, Coast Guard's and TSA's AAs did not fully or substantially meet three of these characteristics, and DHS guidance for conducting AAs did not substantially incorporate certain best practices, such as identifying significant risks and mitigation strategies and performing an independent review to help validate the AOA process. Based on these analyses and other factors, the TRIO components determined that migrating to a federal shared service provider (SSP) represented the best alternative, and in 2014, DHS selected the Department of the Interior's Interior Business Center (IBC) as the federal SSP for the project. However, because Coast Guard's and TSA's AAs did not fully or substantially reflect all of the characteristics noted above, they are at increased risk that the alternative selected may not achieve mission needs. DHS also did not fully follow best practices for managing project risks related to its use of IBC on the TRIO project. Specifically, DHS followed three of seven risk management best practices, such as determining risk sources and categories and establishing a risk management strategy. However, it did not fully follow four best practices for defining risk parameters, identifying risks, developing risk mitigation plans, and implementing these plans largely because its guidance did not sufficiently address these best practices. For example, although DHS created joint teams with IBC and provided additional resources to IBC to help address risk mitigation concerns, it did not always develop sufficiently detailed risk mitigation plans that also included contingency plans for selected critical risks. As a result, although IBC's capacity and experience for migrating large agencies the size of Coast Guard and TSA was identified as a risk in July 2014, a contingency plan working group to address this concern was not established until January 2017. By not fully following risk management best practices, DHS is at increased risk that potential problems may not be identified or properly mitigated. DHS, IBC, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and other federal oversight agencies identified various challenges that have impacted the TRIO project and contributed to a 2-year delay in the implementation of Coast Guard's and TSA's modernized solutions. These challenges include the lack of sufficient resources, aggressive schedule, complex requirements, increased costs, and project management and communication concerns. To help address these challenges, DHS and IBC established review teams and have taken other steps to assess potential mitigating steps. In May 2017, DHS determined that migrating the solution from IBC to a DHS data center represented the best option and initiated discovery efforts to further assess this as its path forward for the TRIO project. GAO recommends that DHS more fully follow best practices for conducting an AOA process and managing risks.

The LWCF Act authorizes the fund to receive $900 million annually, with the monies available only if appropriated by Congress (i.e., discretionary appropriations). The fund also receives mandatory appropriations under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (GOMESA). The level of annual appropriations for the LWCF has varied since the origin of the fund in FY1965. The LWCF Act outlines uses of the fund for federal and state purposes. Of the total made available through appropriations or deposits under GOMESA, not less than 40% is to be used for \"federal purposes\" and not less than 40% is to be used to provide \"financial assistance to states.\" The act lists the federal purposes for which the President is to allot LWCF funds \"unless otherwise allotted in the appropriation Act making them available.\" These purposes primarily relate to acquisition of lands and waters (and interests therein) by the federal government. With regard to state purposes, the act authorizes a matching grant program to states for outdoor recreation purposes. Throughout the LWCF's history, appropriations acts typically have provided funds for land acquisition and outdoor recreational grants to states. Beginning in FY1998, appropriations also have been provided each year (except FY1999) to fund other purposes related to natural resources. The extent to which the LWCF should be used for purposes other than federal land acquisition and outdoor recreation grants to states, and which other purposes should be funded from the LWCF, continue to be the subject of legislation and debate in Congress. In the past few decades, Presidents have sought LWCF funds for a variety of other purposes. Congress chooses which if any of these requests to fund, and has chosen programs not sought by the President for a particular year. Among other programs, appropriations have been provided for facility maintenance of the land management agencies, ecosystem restoration, the Historic Preservation Fund, the Payments in Lieu of Taxes program, the Forest Legacy Program, State and Tribal Wildlife Grants (under the Fish and Wildlife Service), the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund, U.S. Geological Survey science and cooperative programs, and Bureau of Indian Affairs Indian Land and Water Claim Settlements. Since FY1998, a total of $2.7 billion has been appropriated for other purposes, of a total LWCF appropriation of $18.9 billion over the history of the fund. The Fish and Wildlife Service and the Forest Service have received the largest shares of the total appropriations for other purposes, about $1.4 billion (53%) and $1.0.billion (38%), respectively, from FY1998 to FY2019. Several agencies shared the remaining $0.2 billion (9%) of the appropriations. Both the dollar amounts and the percentages of annual LWCF appropriations for other purposes have varied widely since FY1998. The dollar amounts have ranged from $0 in FY1999 to $456.0 million in FY2001. The percentage of annual funds provided for other purposes ranged from 0% in FY1999 to a high of 59% in both FY2006 and FY2007. In some years, the appropriation for other purposes was significantly less than the Administration requested. For instance, for FY2008, the George W. Bush Administration sought $313.1 million; the appropriation was $101.3 million. The appropriation for other purposes last exceeded $100.0 million in FY2010, and most recently was $93.3 million, in FY2019.

{"pred": " Passage 1\nThe Commercial Crew Program is a NASA program aimed at developing a crew transportation system for the International Space Station (ISS). The program has been experiencing delays, with both Boeing and SpaceX, the two contractors, having delayed their certification milestones to January 2019. NASA's schedule risk analysis indicates that further delays are likely, with a zero percent chance of either contractor meeting their current proposed certification milestone. The analysis suggests that the certification milestone may slip to December 2019 for Boeing and January 2020 for SpaceX. The program's top risks include challenges related to Boeing's abort system performance, parachutes, and launch vehicle, and SpaceX's composite overwrap pressure vessel, engine turbine cracking, and propellant loading procedures. NASA has not fully shared information with Congress regarding the risks of future schedule delays, and the agency lacks a contingency plan to address potential gaps in access to the ISS after 2019. The program's certification process relies on several contractual mechanisms to assess safety, but these mechanisms are in varying stages of completion. The program's chief safety and mission assurance officer is dual-hatted, serving both as a programmatic position and as the safety technical authority, which creates an environment of competing interests. NASA's governance model prescribes a management structure that employs checks and balances among key organizations, but the Commercial Crew Program's approach burdens the safety technical authority with both programmatic and independent technical authority responsibilities. The program's management and oversight approach is an integral part of ensuring that human spaceflight is as safe and successful as possible, and independence of the program management and oversight functions is key to achieving this balance. The report makes five recommendations to NASA, including including the results of its schedule risk analysis in its quarterly reports to Congress, developing and maintaining a contingency plan for ensuring a presence on the ISS, and restructuring the technical authority within the Commercial Crew Program to ensure that the technical authority for the Office of Safety and Mission Assurance is no longer dual-hatted with programmatic and independent technical authority responsibilities. NASA concurred with three of the recommendations, partially concurred with one, and did not concur with the other. The report is available at no charge on the GAO website. The GAO staff who made significant contributions to this report are listed in appendix III. The objectives of the review were to assess the extent to which the contractors have made progress towards meeting NASA's certification requirements and NASA's plans to help ensure continued access to the ISS, and how NASA's certification process addresses safety of the contractors' crew transportation systems. The review was conducted", "answers": ["In 2014, NASA awarded two firm-fixed-price contracts to Boeing and SpaceX, worth a combined total of up to $6.8 billion, to develop crew transportation systems and conduct initial missions to the ISS. In February 2017, GAO found that both contractors had made progress, but their schedules were under mounting pressure. The contractors were originally required to provide NASA all the evidence it needed to certify that their systems met its requirements by 2017. A House report accompanying H.R. 5393 included a provision for GAO to review the progress of NASA's human exploration programs. This report examines the Commercial Crew Program, including (1) the extent to which the contractors have made progress towards certification and (2) how NASA's certification process addresses safety of the contractors' crew transportation systems. GAO analyzed contracts, schedules, and other documentation and spoke with officials from NASA, the Commercial Crew Program, Boeing, SpaceX, and two of NASA's independent review bodies that provide oversight. Both of the Commercial Crew Program's contractors, Boeing and Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX), are making progress finalizing designs and building hardware for their crew transportation systems, but both contractors continue to delay their certification milestone (see figure). Certification is the process that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will use to ensure that each contractor's system meets its requirements for human spaceflight for the Commercial Crew Program. Further delays are likely as the Commercial Crew Program's schedule risk analysis shows that the certification milestone is likely to slip. The analysis identifies a range for each contractor, with an earliest and latest possible completion date, as well as an average. The average certification date was December 2019 for Boeing and January 2020 for SpaceX, according to the program's April 2018 analysis. Since the Space Shuttle was retired in 2011, the United States has been relying on Russia to carry astronauts to and from the International Space Station (ISS). Additional delays could result in a gap in U.S. access to the space station as NASA has contracted for seats on the Russian Soyuz spacecraft only through November 2019. NASA is considering potential options, but it does not have a contingency plan for ensuring uninterrupted U.S. access. NASA's certification process addresses the safety of the contractors' crew transportation systems through several mechanisms, but there are factors that complicate the process. One of these factors is the loss of crew metric that was put in place to capture the probability of death or permanent disability to an astronaut. NASA has not identified a consistent approach for how to assess loss of crew. As a result, officials across NASA have multiple ways of assessing the metric that may yield different results. Consequently, the risk tolerance level that NASA is accepting with loss of crew varies based upon which entity is presenting the results of its assessment. Federal internal controls state that management should define risk tolerances so they are clear and measurable. Without a consistent approach for assessing the metric, the agency as a whole may not clearly capture or document its risk tolerance with respect to loss of crew. GAO is making five recommendations, including that NASA develop a contingency plan for ensuring a U.S. presence on the ISS and clarify how it will determine its risk tolerance for loss of crew. NASA concurred with three recommendations; partially concurred on the recommendation related to loss of crew; and non-concurred with a recommendation to report its schedule analysis to Congress. GAO believes these recommendations remain valid, as discussed in the report."], "length": 13579}
{"pred": " Passage 1\nThe James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) project has faced numerous challenges, including significant schedule delays and cost increases. The project has undergone two replans, with the most recent one in 2018, which resulted in a new launch date of March 2021 and a revised cost estimate of $9.7 billion. The project has implemented various measures to mitigate risks, including adding schedule reserves and conducting risk assessments. However, the project still faces technical challenges, including issues with the sunshield and the spacecraft's pressure transducers. The project has also experienced workmanship errors, including the damage of a sunshield component and the improper installation of a radiator panel. To address these issues, the project has implemented various corrective actions, including the development of a new design for the sunshield membrane tensioning system. The project's ability to execute to its new schedule will be tested as it progresses through the remaining phases of integration and test. The project's oversight structure has been augmented, and the project manager has sole responsibility for ensuring that these improvements are sustained through launch. The NASA Administrator should direct the JWST project office to conduct a Joint Cost and Schedule Confidence Level (JCL) analysis prior to its system integration review. This would provide NASA and Congress with critical information for making informed resource decisions on the JWST project and its affordability within NASA's portfolio of projects more broadly. The JCL analysis would also inform decision makers on the status of the project as they determine whether the project can complete remaining project development with acceptable risk and within its cost and schedule constraints.

The project has delayed its planned launch three times since September 2017 due to problems discovered in testing. In June 2018, NASA approved new cost and schedule estimates for JWST. Since the project established its cost and schedule baselines in 2009, the project's costs have increased by 95 percent and the launch date has been moved back by 81 months. Conference Report No. 112-284, accompanying the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012, included a provision for GAO to assess the project annually and report on its progress. This is the seventh report. This report assesses (1) the considerations NASA took into account when updating the project's cost and schedule commitments and (2) the extent to which NASA has taken steps to improve oversight and performance of JWST, among other issues. GAO reviewed relevant NASA policies, analyzed NASA and contractor data, and interviewed NASA and contractor officials. In June 2018, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) revised the cost and schedule commitments for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to reflect known technical challenges, as well as provide additional time to address unanticipated challenges. For example, the revised launch readiness date of March 2021 included 5.5 months to address a design issue for the cover of the sunshield (see image). The purpose of the sunshield is to protect the telescope's mirrors and instruments from the sun's heat. NASA found that hardware on the cover came loose during testing in April 2018. The new cost estimate of $9.7 billion is driven by the schedule extension, which requires keeping the contractor's workforce on board longer than expected. Before the project enters its final phase of integration and test, it must conduct a review to determine if it can launch within its cost and schedule commitments. As part of this review, the project is not required to update its joint cost and schedule confidence level analysis—an analysis that provides the probability the project can meet its cost and schedule commitments—but government and industry cost and schedule experts have found it is a best practice to do so. Such analysis would provide NASA officials with better information to support decisions on allocating resources, especially in light of the project's recent cost and schedule growth. NASA has taken steps to improve oversight and performance of JWST, and identified the JWST project manager as responsible for monitoring the continued implementation of these changes. Examples of recent changes include increasing on-site presence at the contractor facility and conducting comprehensive audits of design processes. Sustaining focus on these changes through launch will be important if schedule pressures arise later and because of past challenges with communications. GAO will follow up on the project's monitoring of these improvements in future reviews. GAO recommends NASA update the project's joint cost and schedule confidence level analysis.

{"pred": " Passage 1\nThe Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is a federal program that provides food assistance to low-income individuals and families. The program has various work requirements for recipients, including registering for work, reporting to an employer, and participating in a SNAP Employment and Training (E&T) program. Able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWDs) are subject to additional work requirements, including working or participating in a work program for 20 hours or more per week. States have flexibility in designing their SNAP E&T programs, and some have moved from mandatory to voluntary programs. The number of SNAP recipients and work registrants participating in SNAP E&T programs has decreased in recent years, and the characteristics of SNAP E&T participants are generally similar to those of SNAP work registrants who do not participate in these programs. The federal government has taken steps to increase federal support of states' SNAP E&T programs, including increasing the number of federal staff responsible for SNAP E&T and providing additional technical assistance to states. However, concerns remain about the effectiveness of SNAP E&T programs and the need for improved data on program outcomes. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has identified several areas for improvement, including the need for more robust employment and training services, better data on program outcomes, and improved oversight of state anti-fraud activities. The GAO has also recommended that the Department of Agriculture (USDA) take steps to address these concerns, including providing additional technical assistance to states and improving the accuracy of SNAP payment data. Overall, the effectiveness of SNAP E&T programs is a complex issue that requires continued attention and improvement. Key evidence presented includes data on the number of SNAP recipients and work registrants participating in SNAP E&T programs, as well as data on the characteristics of SNAP E&T participants.

In fiscal year 2017, it provided about $63 billion in benefits. USDA and the states jointly administer SNAP and partner to address issues that affect program integrity, including improper payments and fraud. GAO has previously reported on various aspects of SNAP, including state SNAP E&T programs, improper payment rates, recipient fraud, and retailer trafficking. This testimony discusses GAO's prior and ongoing work on (1) SNAP E&T programs, including program participants, design, and USDA oversight, and (2) USDA's efforts to address SNAP program integrity, including improper payments, as well as recipient and retailer fraud. As part of its ongoing work on SNAP E&T programs, GAO analyzed E&T expenditures and participation data from fiscal years 2007 through 2016, the most recent data available; reviewed relevant research from USDA; and interviewed USDA and selected state and local officials. The prior work discussed in this testimony is based on four GAO products on E&T programs (GAO-03-388), improper payments (GAO-16-708T), recipient fraud (GAO-14-641), and retailer trafficking (GAO-07-53). Information on the scope and methodology of our prior work is available in each product. Overseen by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and administered by states, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Employment and Training (E&T) programs served about 0.5 percent of the approximately 43.5 million SNAP recipients in an average month of fiscal year 2016, according to the most recent USDA data available. These programs are generally designed to help SNAP recipients increase their ability to obtain regular employment through services such as job search and training. Some recipients may be required to participate. According to USDA, about 14 percent of SNAP recipients were subject to work requirements in an average month of fiscal year 2016, while others, such as children and the elderly, were generally exempt from these requirements. States have flexibility in how they design their E&T programs. Over the last several years, states have 1) increasingly moved away from programs that mandate participation, 2) focused on serving able-bodied adults without dependents whose benefits are generally time-limited unless they comply with work requirements, and 3) partnered with state and local organizations to deliver services. USDA has taken steps to increase support and oversight of SNAP E&T since 2014, including collecting new data on participant outcomes from states. GAO has ongoing work reviewing SNAP E&T programs, including USDA oversight. USDA and the states partner to address issues that affect program integrity, including improper payments and fraud, and USDA has taken some steps to address challenges in these areas, but issues remain. Improper Payments. In 2016, GAO reviewed SNAP improper payment rates and found that states' adoption of program flexibilities and changes in federal SNAP policy in the previous decade, as well as improper payment rate calculation methods, likely affected these rates. Although USDA reported improper payment estimates for SNAP in previous years, USDA did not report an estimate for benefits paid in fiscal years 2015 or 2016 due to data quality issues in some states. USDA has since been working with the states to improve improper payment estimates for the fiscal year 2017 review. Recipient Fraud. In 2014, GAO made recommendations to USDA to address challenges states faced in combatting recipient fraud. For example, GAO found that USDA's guidance on the use of transaction data to uncover potential trafficking lacked specificity and recommended USDA develop additional guidance. Since then, USDA has provided technical assistance to some states, including on the use of data analytics. GAO has ongoing work reviewing states' use of data analytics to identify SNAP recipient fraud. Retailer Trafficking. In 2006, GAO identified several ways in which SNAP was vulnerable to retailer trafficking—a practice involving the exchange of benefits for cash or non-food items. For example, USDA had not conducted analyses to identify high-risk retailers and target its resources. Since then, USDA has established risk levels for retailers based on various factors. GAO has ongoing work assessing how USDA prevents, detects, and responds to retailer trafficking and reviewing the usefulness of USDA's estimates of the extent of SNAP retailer trafficking.

The medical centers also failed to conduct retrospective reviews for 8 providers and lacked documentation for 12 providers. The GAO attributed these shortcomings to VHA policy, which does not require documentation of all types of reviews, and inadequate oversight by VHA networks. The review also found that the VA medical centers failed to report 9 providers to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) and state licensing boards as required, despite documenting significant clinical deficiencies.

The passage explains that funding gaps can result in a shutdown of affected projects or activities, including the furlough of non-excepted personnel. The passage also notes that the Office of Management and Budget has previously indicated that a shutdown of agency operations within the first day of a funding gap may be postponed if it appears that an additional CR or regular appropriations act is likely to be enacted that same day. The passage provides a historical context of funding gaps, noting that there have been 20 funding gaps since FY1977, with the majority occurring between FY1977 and FY1995. The passage also highlights the impact of funding gaps on federal employees, noting that in some cases, thousands of employees have been furloughed during funding gaps. The passage concludes by noting that funding gaps can have significant consequences for federal agencies and employees, and that the federal government should take steps to avoid them. Key evidence presented in the passage includes data on the number and duration of funding gaps, as well as examples of funding gaps that resulted in significant disruptions to federal operations. Unique points made in the passage include the concept of an \"automatic continuing resolution\" (ACR) that would provide a fallback source of funding authority for activities in the event of a funding gap.

These gaps can result in a shutdown of affected projects or activities, including the furlough of non-excepted personnel. Since FY1977, there have been 20 funding gaps, with the majority occurring between FY1977 and FY1995. Funding gaps can have significant consequences for federal agencies and employees, with thousands of employees furloughed during these events. The Office of Management and Budget has previously", "answers": ["The Antideficiency Act (31 U.S.C. 1341-1342, 1511-1519) generally bars the obligation of funds in the absence of appropriations. Exceptions are made under the act, including for activities involving \"the safety of human life or the protection of property.\" The interval during the fiscal year when appropriations for a particular project or activity are not enacted into law, either in the form of a regular appropriations act or a continuing resolution (CR), is referred to as a funding gap or funding lapse. Although funding gaps may occur at the start of the fiscal year, they may also occur any time a CR expires and another CR (or the regular appropriations bill) is not enacted immediately thereafter. Multiple funding gaps may occur within a fiscal year. When a funding gap occurs, federal agencies are generally required to begin a shutdown of the affected projects and activities, which includes the prompt furlough of non-excepted personnel. The general practice of the federal government after the shutdown has ended has been to retroactively pay furloughed employees for the time they missed, as well as employees who were required to come to work. Although a shutdown may be the result of a funding gap, the two events should be distinguished. This is because a funding gap may result in a total shutdown of all affected projects or activities in some instances but not others. For example, when funding gaps are of a short duration, agencies may not have enough time to complete a shutdown of affected projects and activities before funding is restored. In addition, the Office of Management and Budget has previously indicated that a shutdown of agency operations within the first day of the funding gap may be postponed if a resolution appears to be imminent. Since FY1977, 20 funding gaps occurred, ranging in duration from 1 day to 34 full days. These funding gaps are listed in Table 1. About half of these funding gaps were brief (i.e., three days or less in duration). Notably, many of the funding gaps do not appear to have resulted in a \"shutdown.\" Prior to the issuance of the opinions in 1980 and early 1981 by then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti, while agencies tended to curtail some operations in response to a funding gap, they often \"continued to operate during periods of expired funding.\" In addition, some of the funding gaps after the Civiletti opinions did not result in a completion of shutdown operations due to both the funding gap's short duration and an expectation that appropriations would soon be enacted. Some of the funding gaps during this period, however, did have a broader impact on affected government operations, even if only for a matter of hours. Two funding gaps occurred in FY1996, amounting to 5 days and 21 days. The chronology of regular and continuing appropriations enacted during FY1996 is illustrated in Figure 1. At the beginning of FY2014 (October 1, 2013), none of the regular appropriations bills had been enacted, so a government-wide funding gap occurred. It concluded on October 17, 2013, after lasting 16 full days. During FY2018, there was a funding gap when a CR covering all of the regular appropriations bills expired on January 19, 2018. It concluded on January 22, 2018, after lasting two full days. The most recent funding gap occurred during FY2019, when a CR covering federal agencies and activities funded in 7 of the 12 regular appropriations bills expired on December 21, 2018. It concluded on January 25, 2019, after lasting 34 full days.

{"pred": " Passage 1\nThe National Academies' 2006 report on radiation and human health concluded that the balance of evidence favors a simple proportionate relationship between radiation at low doses and cancer risk. The linear no-threshold model, which assumes that the risk of cancer increases with every incremental increase in radiation exposure, is used by federal agencies to set dose limits for radiation exposure. However, there is uncertainty about the extent to which the health effects for non-U.S. populations can be extrapolated to a U.S. population that is regularly exposed to low-dose radiation. Despite this uncertainty, the National Academies' report strengthened confidence in the 2006 report's estimates of cancer risk. The National Cancer Institute's internal research program for radiation epidemiology and other NIH research programs fund studies on low-dose radiation. The Epidemiological Study of One Million U.S. Radiation Workers and Veterans, an ongoing study headed by the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements, is funded by several agencies, including DOE. The seven agencies that funded research on health effects of low-dose radiation collectively decreased their annual funding obligations in this area by 48 percent from fiscal year 2012 to fiscal year 2016. The GAO recommended that the Secretary of Energy lead the development of a mechanism for interagency collaboration to determine roles and responsibilities for addressing priorities related to research on the health effects of low-dose radiation. However, DOE did not agree with the recommendation, stating that EPA and NRC also have legal mandates to research low-dose radiation exposure. The GAO believes that DOE is in the best position to lead agencies in developing the most appropriate mechanism for interagency collaboration. \n\nSummary: Passage 2\nThe Department of Defense (DOD) has taken steps to reduce costs and increase efficiencies in its document services, including implementing a transformation plan for DLA Document Services and reducing the number and cost of print devices.

DLA Document Services' transformation plan aims to transition DOD from on-site printing to digital, online services by transforming the way customers, the workforce, and in-house facilities operate.

The Department of Energy (DOE), Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Food and Drug Administration generally used the advice of scientific advisory bodies to develop and apply radiation protection requirements and guidance for workers and the public in the radiation exposure settings that GAO reviewed. These settings were: (1) the operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants; (2) the cleanup of sites with radiological contamination; (3) the use of medical equipment that produces radiation; and (4) accidental or terrorism-related exposure to radiation. Specifically, the agencies relied on the advice of three scientific advisory bodies that supported the use of a model that assumes the risk of cancer increases with every incremental radiation exposure. Accordingly, the agencies have set regulatory dose limits and issued guidance to confine exposure to levels that reduce the risk of cancer, while recognizing that scientific uncertainties occur in estimating cancer risks from low-dose radiation. For example, NRC requires nuclear power plants to consider measures for limiting workers' exposure below NRC's regulatory dose limit, such as by using robots for maintenance work in radiation areas. GAO identified seven federal agencies that funded research on low-dose radiation's health effects. In fiscal years 2012 to 2016, DOE, NRC, EPA, and four other federal agencies obligated about $210 million for such research . Although the agencies have collaborated on individual projects on radiation's health effects, they have not established a collaborative mechanism to set research priorities. GAO's previous work has shown that federal agencies can use such mechanisms to implement interagency collaboration to develop and coordinate sound science policies. In the past, DOE took a leading role in this area because DOE provided stable funding and advocated for greater coordination on research on low-dose radiation's health effects. However, since fiscal year 2012, DOE has phased out funding for one of its main research programs in this area. This has created a void in coordination efforts among federal agencies, and no other agency has stepped forward to fill this void. Because of DOE's prior experience as a leader in this area of research and its research responsibility under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, it could play an important role in helping federal agencies establish a coordinating mechanism for low-dose radiation research.

{"pred": " Passage 1\nThe Department of Defense (DOD) has been exploring the use of commercially hosted payloads to gain space-based capability. This approach involves integrating a DOD payload onto a commercial satellite, which operates on orbit using the host satellite's resources. The benefits of using commercially hosted payloads include cost savings, faster on-orbit capability, and increased deterrence and resilience. DOD has launched three experimental payloads on commercial host satellites and plans to conduct three more missions through 2022. The Air Force has saved several hundred million dollars by using commercial host satellites for its experimental payloads. However, DOD officials have identified logistical challenges to matching government payloads with commercial host satellites, including size, weight, and power constraints. The Hosted Payload Office (HPO) is developing tools to help address these challenges and has proposed several approaches to match properties like size, weight, and power between a DOD payload and a commercial host satellite. The HPO is also developing a hosted payload interface unit that could provide a standard for payload developers and system integrators to develop and test their systems. Despite the challenges, DOD officials believe that commercially hosted payloads have the potential to play a role in delivering needed capabilities on orbit more quickly and at a more affordable cost than traditional DOD space acquisitions. However, DOD's experience and data collected so far are limited in informing decisions on the use of these payloads. Therefore, the Secretary of Defense should require programs using hosted payloads to provide cost and technical data, and lessons learned to a central office. This would help enable DOD to mitigate the logistical challenges inherent in matching payloads to hosts and make reasoned, evidence-based decisions on whether a hosted payload would be a viable solution to meet warfighter needs. \n\nNote: The summary is limited to one page and focuses on the main arguments, key evidence, and unique points made in Passage 1. \n\nPlease let me know if you need any further assistance. \n\nHere is a summary of Passage 2:\n\nSummary: Passage 2\nThe Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant is a federal program that provides funding to states for programs that help low-income families.

States are required to expend a minimum amount of their own funds for TANF and TANF-related activities under the maintenance of effort (MOE) requirement. The MO", "answers": ["Each year, DOD spends billions of dollars to develop, produce, and field large, complex satellites. For such satellite systems, a single adversary attack or on-orbit failure can result in the loss of billions of dollars of investment and significant loss of vital capabilities. As DOD plans new space systems and addresses an increasingly contested space environment, it has the opportunity to consider different acquisition approaches. One such approach is to integrate a government sensor or payload onto a commercial host satellite. House Armed Services Committee report 115-200, accompanying a bill for the Fiscal Year 2018 National Defense Authorization Act, included a provision for GAO to review DOD's use of commercially hosted payloads. This report (1) determines the extent to which DOD uses commercially hosted payloads and (2) describes and assesses factors that affect their use. GAO reviewed DOD policies, documentation, and planning documents, and interviewed a wide range of DOD and civil government officials, and commercial stakeholders. GAO and others have found that using commercial satellites to host government sensors or communications packages—called payloads—may be one way DOD can achieve on-orbit capability faster and more affordably. Using hosted payloads may also help facilitate a proliferation of payloads on orbit, making it more difficult for an adversary to defeat a capability. Since 2009, DOD has used three commercially hosted payloads, with three more missions planned or underway through 2022 (see figure below). DOD estimates that it has achieved cost savings of several hundred million dollars from using commercially hosted payloads to date, and expects to realize additional savings and deliver faster capabilities on orbit from planned missions. Cost savings can result from sharing development, launch, and ground system costs with the commercial host company. Among the factors that affect DOD's use of hosted payloads are a perception among some DOD officials that matching government payloads to commercial satellites is too difficult; and limited, fragmented knowledge on how to mitigate various challenges GAO found that further opportunities to use hosted payloads may emerge as DOD plans new and follow-on space systems in the coming years. However, DOD's knowledge on using hosted payloads is fragmented, in part because programs are not required to share information. In 2011, the Air Force created a Hosted Payload Office to provide expertise and other tools to facilitate matching government payloads with commercial hosts. However, GAO found that DOD programs using hosted payloads are not required and generally do not provide cost and technical data, or lessons learned, to the Hosted Payload Office, or another central office for analysis. Requiring programs that use hosted payloads agency-wide to provide this information to a central location would better position DOD to make informed decisions when considering acquisition approaches for upcoming space system designs. GAO recommends that DOD require programs using commercially hosted payloads to contribute resulting data to a central location. In implementing this recommendation, DOD should assess whether the Air Force's Hosted Payload Office is the appropriate location to collect and analyze the data.

The rule is intended to apply only to obvious reductions of funds in a general appropriations bill, achieved through specific reductions of total appropriations or cessation of government activities. The House has interpreted the rule through precedents, narrowing its application over time. The rule does not allow for broad legislative provisions or limitations, and its application is subject to the requirement of germaneness. The 115th Congress reinstated language that had been stricken from the rule in 1983, allowing for retrenchments resulting from a reduction of the number and salary of officers or the compensation of any person paid out of the Treasury.

In 2016, coal accounted for 17% of energy production in the US, with 730 million tons of coal mined domestically. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) requires operators to obtain permits and provide financial assurances for reclamation. OSMRE and state regulatory authorities manage financial assurances, which can be in the form of surety bonds, collateral bonds, or self-bonds. However, self-bonding poses risks, including the potential for operators to enter bankruptcy and leave taxpayers responsible for reclamation costs. OSMRE has taken steps to address these risks, including reviewing financial assurance amounts and inspecting mine sites. Despite these efforts, challenges remain, including the difficulty in determining whether an operator qualifies for self-bonding and the risk associated with self-bonding. The GAO recommends that Congress consider amending SMCRA to eliminate the use of self-bonding as a type of financial assurance for coal mine reclamation. Key evidence includes data on coal production, financial assurance amounts, and the number of inspections conducted by OSMRE. Unique points include the complexity of financial relationships between parent and subsidiary companies and the need for regulatory authorities to employ financial experts to evaluate operators' financial health. The GAO's recommendations aim to ensure that reclamation costs are covered and that taxpayers are not left responsible for these costs. \n\nSummary: Passage 2\nThe Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA) provides workers' compensation coverage for longshore, harbor, and other maritime occupations on or adjacent to navigable waters of the US.

The program provides medical and disability benefits to injured workers and survivors' benefits to families of deceased workers. The LHWCA has been amended four times to extend coverage to occupations outside its original scope. Employers may either purchase private insurance or self-insure to provide LHWCA benefits. The DOL operates the Special Fund to provide benefits in cases where the responsible employer or insurance carrier cannot pay.

Key evidence includes data on the number of workers covered, benefits paid, and the number of amendments to the LHWCA. Unique points include the", "answers": ["Coal accounts for 17 percent of domestic energy production. SMCRA requires coal mine operators to reclaim lands that were disturbed during mining and to submit a financial assurance in an amount sufficient to ensure that adequate funds will be available to complete reclamation if the operator does not do so. Recent coal company bankruptcies have drawn attention to whether financial assurances obtained by OSMRE and state agencies will be adequate to reclaim land once coal mining operations have ceased. GAO was asked to review management of financial assurances for coal mine reclamation. This report describes, among other things, the amounts and types of financial assurances held for coal mine reclamation in 2017 and the challenges that OSMRE and state agencies face in managing these financial assurances. GAO collected and analyzed data from OSMRE and 23 state agencies; reviewed federal laws, regulations, and directives; and interviewed OSMRE and state agency officials and representatives from organizations associated with the mining and financial assurance industries and environmental organizations. State agencies and the Department of the Interior's Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE) reported holding approximately $10.2 billion in surety bonds (guaranteed by a third party), collateral bonds (guaranteed by a tangible asset, such as a certificate of deposit), and self-bonds (guaranteed on the basis of a coal operator's own finances) as financial assurances for coal mine reclamation. OSMRE and state agencies face several challenges in managing financial assurances, according to the stakeholders GAO interviewed. Specifically, Obtaining additional financial assurances from operators for unanticipated reclamation costs, such as long-term treatment for water pollution, can be difficult. Determining the financial stability of surety companies has been challenging in certain instances. Self-bonding presents a risk to the government because it is difficult to (1) ascertain the financial health of an operator, (2) determine whether the operator qualifies for self-bonding, and (3) obtain a replacement for existing self-bonds when an operator no longer qualifies. In addition, some stakeholders said that the risk from self-bonding is greater now than when the practice was first authorized under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA). GAO's previous work examining environmental cleanup found that the financial risk to government and the amount of oversight needed for self-bonds are relatively high compared to other forms of financial assurances. GAO also previously reviewed federal financial assurance requirements for various energy and mineral extraction sectors and found that coal mining is the only one where self-bonding was allowed. However, because SMCRA explicitly allows states to decide whether to accept self-bonds, eliminating the risk that self-bonds pose to the federal government and states would require SMCRA be amended. GAO recommends that Congress consider amending SMCRA to eliminate self-bonding. Interior neither agreed nor disagreed with GAO's recommendation."], "length": 13987}

The passage highlights the importance of accurate and allowable expenditures to ensure that federal funds are appropriately spent. CMS has various procedures in place to review state-reported expenditures, including quarterly reviews and focused financial management reviews (FMRs). However, the passage identifies weaknesses in CMS's oversight, including inconsistent allocation of resources across regional offices and a lack of a comprehensive national risk assessment. The passage also notes that CMS's sampling methodology for reviewing expenditures for the Medicaid expansion population does not account for risk factors like program size or vulnerabilities in state eligibility-determination processes and systems. As a result, errors may be going undetected, and CMS may be providing federal funds at higher matching rates than is allowable. The passage recommends that CMS complete a comprehensive national risk assessment, clarify internal guidance on when a variance analysis on higher matched expenditures is required, and revise the sampling methodology for reviewing expenditures for the Medicaid expansion population to better target reviews to areas of high risk. The passage concludes that CMS's oversight of state-reported expenditures is critical to ensuring that federal funds are appropriately spent and that CMS should take steps to improve its oversight processes. \n\nPassage 1 discusses the development and acquisition of the Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV) by the Marine Corps.

The passage also discusses the development of the Marine Personnel Carrier (MPC), which is intended to serve as a survivable and mobile platform to transport Marines when ashore. The passage notes that the MPC was not intended to be amphibious like the AAV or ACV but would have a swim capability for inland waterways. The passage also discusses the challenges faced by the Marine Corps in developing the ACV, including difficulties in achieving high water speed and the need for a connector to get the vehicles from ship to shore. The passage concludes that the ACV is on track to meet development cost goals and is expected to be fielded by summer 2023. The passage also notes that the Marine Corps plans to develop an ACV 2.0, capable of carrying 10 to 13 Marines plus crew, capable of high water speeds, and deployment from ships far from the coast. \n\nNote: The summary", "answers": ["Medicaid has grown by over 50 percent over the last decade, with about $370 billion in federal spending in fiscal year 2017. CMS is responsible for assuring that expenditures—reported quarterly by states—are consistent with Medicaid requirements and matched with the correct amount of federal funds. CMS's review of reported expenditures has become increasingly complex due to variation in states' Medicaid programs and an increasing number of different matching rates. GAO was asked to examine CMS's oversight of state-reported Medicaid expenditures. In this report, GAO examined how CMS assures that (1) expenditures are supported and consistent with requirements; and (2) the correct federal matching rates were applied to expenditures subject to a higher match. GAO also examined the financial impact of resolved errors. GAO reviewed documentation for the most recently completed quarterly reviews by 3 of CMS's 10 regional offices for six states that varied by Medicaid program expenditures and design. GAO also reviewed policies, procedures, and data on resolved errors; and interviewed CMS and state officials. GAO assessed CMS's oversight processes against federal standards for internal control. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), which oversees Medicaid, has various review processes in place to assure that expenditures reported by states are supported and consistent with Medicaid requirements. The agency also has processes to review that the correct federal matching rates were applied to expenditures receiving a higher than standard federal matching rate, which can include certain types of services and populations. These processes collectively have had a considerable federal financial benefit, with CMS resolving errors that reduced federal spending by over $5.1 billion in fiscal years 2014 through 2017. However, GAO identified weaknesses in how CMS targets its resources to address risks when reviewing whether expenditures are supported and consistent with requirements. CMS devotes similar levels of staff resources to review expenditures despite differing levels of risk across states. For example, the number of staff reviewing California's expenditures—which represent 15 percent of federal Medicaid spending—is similar to the number reviewing Arkansas' expenditures, which represents 1 percent of federal Medicaid spending. CMS cancelled in-depth financial management reviews in 17 out of 51 instances over the last 5 years. These reviews target expenditures considered by CMS to be at risk of not meeting program requirements. CMS told GAO that resource constraints contributed to both weaknesses. However, the agency has not completed a comprehensive assessment of risk to (1) determine whether oversight resources are adequate and (2) focus on the most significant areas of risk. Absent such an assessment, CMS is missing an opportunity to identify errors in reported expenditures that could result in substantial savings to the Medicaid program. GAO also found limitations in CMS's processes for reviewing expenditures that receive a higher federal matching rate. Internal guidance for examining variances in these expenditures was unclear, and not all reviewers in the three CMS regional offices GAO reviewed were investigating significant variances in quarter-to-quarter expenditures. Review procedures for expenditures for individuals newly eligible for Medicaid under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act were not tailored to different risk levels among states. For example, in its reviews of a sample of claims for this population, CMS reviewed claims for the same number of enrollees—30—in California as for Arkansas, even though California had 10 times the number of newly eligible enrollees as Arkansas. Without clear internal guidance and better targeting of risks in its review procedures for expenditures receiving higher matching rates, CMS may overpay states. GAO is making three recommendations, including that CMS improve its risk-based targeting of oversight efforts and resources, and clarify related internal guidance.

The program has three components: identification and enrollment, assignment coordination, and family support. Each Military Service has its own EFMP, which is responsible for identifying eligible family members, enrolling them in the program, and providing family support. However, the Services vary in their implementation of the EFMP, with some providing more resources and support than others. The DOD has not developed common performance metrics to track the Services' progress in implementing the EFMP, and the Services are responsible for monitoring their own EFMPs. The Office of Special Needs (OSN) has begun to standardize procedures for assignment coordination and family support, but more work is needed to ensure that all families with special needs receive consistent support. The GAO recommends that the Secretary of Defense direct the OSN to assess the extent to which each Service is providing sufficient resources for family support providers and developing services plans for each family with special needs.

This report examines the extent to which (1) each Service provides family support and (2) the Services monitor and DOD evaluates assignment coordination and family support. GAO analyzed DOD and Service-specific EFMP guidance and documents; analyzed fiscal year 2016 EFMP data (the most recent available); visited seven military installations, selected for their large numbers of military-connected students; and interviewed officials responsible for implementing each Service's EFMP, as well as officials in OSN that administer DOD's EFM policy. The support provided to families with special needs through the Department of Defense's (DOD) Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP) varies widely for each branch of Military Service. Federal law requires DOD's Office of Special Needs (OSN) to develop a uniform policy that includes requirements for (1) developing and updating a services plan for each family with special needs and (2) resources, such as staffing, to ensure an appropriate number of family support providers. OSN has developed such a policy, but DOD relies on each Service to determine its compliance with the policy. However, Army and Navy officials said they have not received feedback from OSN about the extent to which their Service-specific guidance complies. Federal internal control standards call for developing clear policies to achieve agency goals. In addition, DOD's most recent annual reports to Congress do not indicate the extent to which each Service provides services plans or allocates sufficient resources for family support providers. According to GAO's analysis, the Military Services have developed relatively few services plans, and there is wide variation in the number of family support providers employed, which raises questions about potential gaps in services for families with special needs (see table). Each Service uses various mechanisms to monitor how servicemembers are assigned to installations (assignment coordination) and obtain family support, but DOD has not established common performance measures to assess these activities. DOD has taken steps to better support families with special needs, according to the DOD officials GAO interviewed. For example, DOD established a working group to identify gaps in services. However, OSN officials said that DOD lacks common performance measures for assignment coordination and family support because the Services have not reached consensus on what those measures should be. In addition, OSN does not have a process to systematically evaluate the results of the Services' monitoring activities. Federal internal control standards call for assessing performance over time and evaluating the results of monitoring activities. Without establishing common performance measures and assessing monitoring activities, DOD will be unable to fully determine the effect of its efforts to better support families with special needs and the adequacy of the Services' EFMPs as required by federal law. GAO makes a total of three recommendations to DOD. DOD should assess and report to Congress on the extent to which each Service provides sufficient family support personnel and services plans, develop common performance metrics for assignment coordination and family support, and evaluate the results of the Services' monitoring activities.

House Report Number 3128 included a provision for GAO to assess the risks of DHS using IBC in connection with its modernization efforts. This report examines (1) the extent to which DHS and the TRIO components followed best practices in analyzing alternatives, and the key factors, metrics, and processes used in their choice of a modernized financial management system; (2) the extent to which DHS managed the risks of using IBC for its TRIO project consistent with risk management best practices; and (3) the key factors and challenges that have impacted the TRIO project and DHS's plans for completing remaining key priorities. GAO interviewed key officials, reviewed relevant documents, and determined whether DHS followed best practices identified by GAO as necessary characteristics of a reliable, high-quality AOA process and other risk management best practices. The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) TRIO project represents a key effort to address long-standing financial management system deficiencies. During 2012 and 2013, the TRIO components—U.S. Coast Guard (Coast Guard), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO)—each completed an alternatives analysis (AA) to determine a preferred alternative for modernizing its financial management system. GAO found that DNDO's AA substantially met the four characteristics—well-documented, comprehensive, unbiased, and credible—that GAO previously identified for a reliable, high-quality analysis of alternatives (AOA) process. However, Coast Guard's and TSA's AAs did not fully or substantially meet three of these characteristics, and DHS guidance for conducting AAs did not substantially incorporate certain best practices, such as identifying significant risks and mitigation strategies and performing an independent review to help validate the AOA process. Based on these analyses and other factors, the TRIO components determined that migrating to a federal shared service provider (SSP) represented the best alternative, and in 2014, DHS selected the Department of the Interior's Interior Business Center (IBC) as the federal SSP for the project. However, because Coast Guard's and TSA's AAs did not fully or substantially reflect all of the characteristics noted above, they are at increased risk that the alternative selected may not achieve mission needs. DHS also did not fully follow best practices for managing project risks related to its use of IBC on the TRIO project. Specifically, DHS followed three of seven risk management best practices, such as determining risk sources and categories and establishing a risk management strategy. However, it did not fully follow four best practices for defining risk parameters, identifying risks, developing risk mitigation plans, and implementing these plans largely because its guidance did not sufficiently address these best practices. For example, although DHS created joint teams with IBC and provided additional resources to IBC to help address risk mitigation concerns, it did not always develop sufficiently detailed risk mitigation plans that also included contingency plans for selected critical risks. As a result, although IBC's capacity and experience for migrating large agencies the size of Coast Guard and TSA was identified as a risk in July 2014, a contingency plan working group to address this concern was not established until January 2017. By not fully following risk management best practices, DHS is at increased risk that potential problems may not be identified or properly mitigated. DHS, IBC, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and other federal oversight agencies identified various challenges that have impacted the TRIO project and contributed to a 2-year delay in the implementation of Coast Guard's and TSA's modernized solutions. These challenges include the lack of sufficient resources, aggressive schedule, complex requirements, increased costs, and project management and communication concerns. To help address these challenges, DHS and IBC established review teams and have taken other steps to assess potential mitigating steps. In May 2017, DHS determined that migrating the solution from IBC to a DHS data center represented the best option and initiated discovery efforts to further assess this as its path forward for the TRIO project.

Fees are voluntary, but not paying them may make it impossible to carry out many activities legally. The statutory basis for each particular fee or user charge varies in specificity and in the degree of discretion granted to the executive branch. User fees have several advantages, including being voluntary, connecting the burden of financing activities to those who directly benefit from them, and helping to decentralize decisionmaking. However, the flow of user fees and charges may reflect fluctuations in economic conditions, and some are concerned that funding arrangements may bypass regular congressional scrutiny and dilute Congress's power of the purse. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) defines a user fee as a fee assessed to users for goods or services provided by the federal government.

GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care. For example, GAO found that after one VAMC failed to report to the NPDB or SLBs a provider who resigned to avoid an adverse privileging action, a non-VA hospital in the same city took an adverse privileging action against that same provider for the same reason 2 years later."], "length": 13669}

The passage highlights the importance of cost and schedule reserves in managing large projects, citing the example of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) project, which experienced significant cost increases and schedule delays due to inadequate cost and schedule reserves. The passage also notes that NASA has taken steps to improve its project management, including the establishment of a joint cost and schedule confidence level (JCL) and the use of earned value management. However, the passage concludes that NASA still has opportunities to strengthen its program management of major acquisitions, including its space telescopes, by adopting lessons learned from previous projects. The passage also discusses the challenges faced by other NASA projects, including the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), and notes that these projects are making progress but still face challenges in execution. Overall, the passage highlights the importance of effective project management in achieving successful outcomes for large and complex projects like NASA's space telescopes.\n\nPassage 3 discusses the use of cluster munitions, which are weapons that disperse smaller submunitions over an area. The passage notes that cluster munitions have been used in at least 21 states by 13 different countries, and that they have been criticized for their imprecise targeting and high failure rate, which can result in unexploded submunitions that remain hazardous for decades. The passage also discusses the Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM), which bans the use of cluster munitions, as well as their development, production, acquisition, transfer, and stockpiling. However, the passage notes that the United States has not signed the CCM and has instead developed its own policy on cluster munitions, which requires that cluster munitions used after 2018 must leave less than 1% of unexploded submunitions on the battlefield. The passage also discusses the challenges of developing \"smart\" cluster munitions that can detect and engage a single target, and notes that even with advances in technology, cluster munitions may still be considered an indiscriminate area weapon in an era where precision weapons are increasingly becoming the military norm. Overall, the passage highlights the complexities and challenges of cluster munitions and the need for effective policies and technologies to mitigate their risks.", "answers": ["Acquisition management has been a long-standing challenge at NASA, although GAO has reported on improvements the agency has made in recent years. Three space telescope projects are the key enablers for NASA to achieve its astrophysics' science goals, which include seeking to understand the universe. In its fiscal year 2018 budget request, NASA asked for about $697 million for these three projects, which represents over 50 percent of NASA's budget for its astrophysics' major projects. In total, these projects represent an expected investment of at least $12.4 billion. This statement reflects preliminary observations on (1) the current status and cost of NASA's major telescope projects and (2) lessons learned that can be applied to NASA's management of its telescope projects. This statement is based on ongoing work on JWST and ongoing work on the status of NASA's major projects. Both reports are planned to be published in Spring 2018. This statement is also based on past GAO reports on JWST and NASA's acquisitions of major projects, and NASA input. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) current portfolio of major space telescopes includes three projects that vary in cost, complexity, and phase of the acquisition life cycle. GAO's ongoing work indicates that these projects are each making progress in line with their phase of the acquisition cycle but also face some challenges. For example, the current launch date for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) project reflects a 57-60-month delay from the project's original schedule. GAO's preliminary observations indicate this project still has significant integration and testing to complete, with very little schedule reserve remaining to account for delays. Therefore, additional delays beyond the delay of up to 8 months recently announced are likely, and funding available under the $8 billion Congressional cost cap for formulation and development may be inadequate. There are a number of lessons learned from its acquisitions that NASA could consider to increase the likelihood of successful outcomes for its telescope projects, as well as for its larger portfolio of projects, such as its human spaceflight projects. For example, twice in the history of the JWST program, independent reviews found that the program was not holding adequate cost and schedule reserves. GAO has found that NASA has not applied this lesson learned to all of its large projects, and similar outcomes to JWST have started to emerge. For example, NASA did not incorporate this lesson with its human spaceflight programs. In July 2016 and April 2017, GAO found that these programs were holding inadequate levels of cost and schedule reserves to cover unexpected cost increases or delays. In April 2017, GAO recommended that NASA reassess the date of the programs' first test flight. NASA concurred and, in November 2017, announced a launch delay of up to 19 months.

The SBA also sets size standards to determine eligibility for federal small business contracting purposes. The SBA's size standards are designed to encourage competition within each industry and ensure that SBA assistance is provided only to firms that are not dominant in their field on a national basis.

The report shows that federal agencies have generally met the goals for small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, but have struggled to meet the goals for women-owned small businesses and HUBZone small businesses. The Small Business Goaling Report has limitations, including not including all federal contracts and not evaluating the effect of these contracts on small businesses, industry competitiveness, or the overall economy. Despite these limitations, the report can help policymakers identify programs most in need of examination. The SBA has announced that it is focusing additional efforts on promoting the HUBZone program to federal contracting officials due to the continuing difficulties federal agencies have had in meeting the 3% goal for HUBZone small businesses.

One way in which Congress has exercised this authority is by adopting measures to promote contracting and subcontracting between \"small businesses\" and federal agencies. These measures, among other things, declare a congressional policy of ensuring that a \"fair proportion\" of federal contract and subcontract dollars is awarded to small businesses; establish government-wide and agency-specific goals for the percentage of federal contract and subcontract dollars awarded to small businesses; establish an annual Small Business Goaling Report to measure progress in meeting these goals; generally require federal agencies, under specified circumstances, to reserve contracts that have an anticipated value greater than the micro-purchase threshold (currently $10,000), but not greater than the simplified acquisition threshold (currently $250,000) exclusively for small businesses; authorize federal agencies, under specified circumstances, to set aside contracts that have an anticipated value greater than the simplified acquisition threshold exclusively for small businesses; authorize federal agencies to make sole source awards to small businesses when the award could not otherwise be made (e.g., only a single source is available, under urgent and compelling circumstances); authorize federal agencies to set aside contracts for, or grant other contracting preference to, specific types of small businesses (e.g., 8(a) small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, women-owned small businesses (WOSBs) and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSBs)); and task the Small Business Administration (SBA) and other federal procurement officers with reviewing and restructuring proposed procurements to maximize opportunities for small business participation. Small business contracting programs generally have strong bipartisan support. However, that does not mean that these programs face no opposition, or that issues have not been raised concerning the impact and operations of specific programs. For example, small business advocates note that implementing regulations in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) narrow the reach (and impact) of some small business contracting preferences by excluding specific types of contracts, such as those listed in the Federal Supply Schedules, from FAR requirements pertaining to small business contracting. Advocates want the federal government to enact policies that reduce or eliminate such exclusions. Critics have questioned some of these programs' effectiveness, in terms of both promoting small business opportunities to win federal contracts and promoting a more diversified, robust economy. Many observers judge the relative success or failure of federal efforts to enhance small business contracting opportunities by whether federal government and individual federal agencies meet the predetermined procurement goals in the annual Small Business Goaling Report. In recent years, the federal government has generally succeeded in meeting the government-wide goals of awarding 23% of the total value of all small business eligible prime contract awards to small businesses, 5% to small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs), and 3% to SDVOSBs. It has had difficulty meeting the goals of 5% to WOSBs and 3% to HUBZone small businesses. The Small Business Goaling Report is the most convenient measure available to compare federal small business contracting performance over time, but it has limitations. For example, the SBA excludes some contracts from the report in its determination of what is \"small business eligible\" and some federal procurement activities are not included because they are not recorded in the Federal Procurement Data System—Next Generation.

{"pred": " Passage 2\nThe Commercial Space Launch Act Amendments of 1988 established the foundation for the U.S. policy to provide federal payment for a portion of claims by third parties for injury, damage, or loss resulting from a commercial launch or reentry accident. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) calculates the Maximum Potential Loss (MPL) value, which is the greatest dollar amount of loss to third parties and the federal government for bodily injury and property damage that can be reasonably expected to result from a launch or reentry accident. However, the FAA's MPL methodology has several weaknesses, including an outdated cost-of-casualty amount, which has not been updated since 1988, and a method for estimating property damage that can lead to overestimates. The FAA has implemented some improvements, such as the risk profile method, but has not fully addressed these weaknesses. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommends that the FAA reexamine the current probability thresholds, analyze the cost impact of implementing its revised MPL methodology, and consult with the commercial space sector and insurance providers to evaluate the effects on key potential costs to launch companies and the federal government. The GAO also recommends that the FAA establish an estimated completion date for developing and implementing a plan to establish guidance on the most appropriate MPL methodologies and tools to use for each launch. The Department of Transportation concurred with the GAO's recommendations. The FAA's MPL methodology is critical in balancing the encouragement of the U.S. commercial space industry with the need to manage the federal government's risk exposure, and addressing these weaknesses is essential to ensure the validity of the MPL methodology and the results obtained for each launch.", "answers": ["The federal government shares liability risks with the commercial space launch industry for accidents that result in damages to third parties or federal property. This arrangement requires space launch companies to have a specific amount of insurance to cover these damages. The government is potentially liable for damages above that amount, up to a cap GAO estimated to be $3.1 billion in 2017, subject to appropriations in advance. CSLCA, enacted in 2015, directed the Department of Transportation, of which FAA is a part, to evaluate its MPL methodology and, if necessary, develop a plan to update that methodology. The act also included a provision requiring GAO to assess FAA's evaluation and any actions needed to update the methodology. This report discusses the extent to which (1) FAA's evaluation report addresses the requirements in CSLCA and (2) FAA has addressed previously identified weaknesses in the MPL methodology. GAO reviewed documents and interviewed FAA on its loss methodology evaluation and actions to address weaknesses. The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) report evaluating its maximum probable loss (MPL) methodology did not fully address the evaluation and consultation requirements specified by the U.S. Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act (CSLCA). Balance of Risk. CSLCA required FAA to include ensuring that the federal government is not exposed to greater indemnification costs and that launch companies are not required to purchase more insurance coverage than necessary as a result of FAA's MPL methodology. FAA said that it ensured this balance by improving its methodology, but it did not reevaluate its probability thresholds after revising its methodology. These thresholds are used to divide the risk of loss between launch companies and the government. Impact on Costs. The act required FAA to consider the costs to both the industry and the federal government of implementing an updated methodology. FAA's report discussed the impact on indirect costs, such as data collection, but did not discuss direct costs: insurance premiums for launch companies and indemnification liability for the federal government. Consultation. The act also required FAA to consult with the commercial space sector and insurance providers in evaluating its MPL methodology in accordance with the preceding requirements. While the agency consulted with some stakeholders, these consultations were limited in scope. FAA officials said they have not been able to take the actions needed to fully satisfy the mandated elements because of issues such as resource limitations and the lack of available data. However, by not resolving these issues, FAA lacks assurance that launch companies are not purchasing more insurance than needed or that the federal government is not being exposed to greater indemnification costs than expected. FAA has addressed two of three previously identified weaknesses in its MPL methodology but has not yet dealt with the remaining weakness. Specifically, the agency has revised its methodology for estimating the number of potential casualties for a launch and changed the factor it uses to derive estimated property damage from estimated casualties. However, FAA has not updated the amount used for the cost of an individual casualty. GAO recommended in a March 2017 report (GAO-17-366) that FAA update this amount. Not doing so could understate the amount of insurance launch companies are required to purchase, exposing the federal government to excess risk. GAO also determined that while FAA has two tools and methods it can use in making its MPL estimates, it does not have guidance on determining which are most appropriate for a given launch scenario. For example, one tool is more comprehensive but also labor intensive to use, while the other is inappropriate for certain launch scenarios and could result in misleading MPL amounts. Officials said they have begun to create such guidance but do not have an estimated completion date. Without such guidance, FAA cannot ensure that the most appropriate MPL methodology is used for each launch. FAA should fully address mandated requirements in evaluating its MPL—probability thresholds, direct costs, and stakeholder consultations— and establish an estimated completion date for developing guidance on tools and methods to use for specific launch scenarios.

{"pred": " Passage 1\nThe U.S. Navy has experienced four significant mishaps at sea since January 2017, resulting in 17 sailor deaths and significant damage to ships. The Navy has 277 ships, a 17% reduction from 1998, and each ship is being deployed more to maintain the same level of presence. The Navy attributes its low readiness levels to increased deployment lengths and the need to shorten or defer training and maintenance periods. The Navy has doubled the percentage of its fleet assigned to overseas homeports since 2006, but this comes at a cost, including higher operations and support costs and difficulty keeping crews fully trained and ships maintained. The Navy has not conducted an assessment of the long-term costs and risks associated with its reliance on overseas homeporting, despite DOD's concurrence with a GAO recommendation to do so. The Navy's current guidance does not require that the factors used to calculate manpower requirements be reassessed periodically or when conditions change, which may lead to readiness and safety risks. The Navy's ships may not have the right number and skill mix of sailors to maintain readiness and prevent overworking its sailors. The Navy's implementation of the optimized fleet response plan has been hindered by difficulty in completing maintenance on time, and the Navy's public shipyards will be unable to support 73 of 218 maintenance periods planned over the next 23 years. The Navy's readiness recovery efforts may be at risk without a comprehensive plan, and the Navy has not developed specific benchmarks or interim goals for tracking and reporting on readiness recovery. The Navy's plans to grow its fleet by 30% will require addressing its readiness problems, including implementing GAO recommendations to assess the risks associated with overseas basing, reassess sailor workload, and manage investments in its shipyards. Congressional oversight will be needed to ensure the Navy demonstrates progress in addressing its maintenance, training, and other challenges. The GAO has issued several reports related to Navy readiness, including a report on the Navy's ability to support its readiness needs, which found that the Navy's public shipyards will be unable to support 73 of 218 maintenance periods planned over the next 23 years. The GAO has made several recommendations to address the Navy's readiness problems, including reassessing the standard workweek, requiring examination of in-port workload, and developing criteria to reassess the factors used in its manpower requirements process.

Three of these incidents involved ships homeported in Japan. In response to these incidents, the Chief of Naval Operations ordered an operational pause for all fleets worldwide, and the Vice Chief of Naval Operations directed a comprehensive review of surface fleet operations, stating that these tragic incidents are not limited occurrences but part of a disturbing trend in mishaps involving U.S. ships. This statement provides information on the effects of homeporting ships overseas, reducing crew size on ships, and not completing maintenance on time on the readiness of the Navy and summarizes GAO recommendations to address the Navy's maintenance, training, and other challenges. In preparing this statement, GAO relied on work it has published since 2015 related to the readiness of ships homeported overseas, sailor training and workload issues, maintenance challenges, and other issues. GAO updated this information, as appropriate, based on Navy data. GAO's prior work shows that the Navy has increased deployment lengths, shortened training periods, and reduced or deferred maintenance to meet high operational demands, which has resulted in declining ship conditions and a worsening trend in overall readiness. The Navy has stated that high demand for presence has put pressure on a fleet that is stretched thin across the globe. Some of the concerns that GAO has highlighted include: Degraded readiness of ships homeported overseas: Since 2006, the Navy has doubled the number of ships based overseas. Overseas basing provides additional forward presence and rapid crisis response, but GAO found in May 2015 that there were no dedicated training periods built into the operational schedules of the cruisers and destroyers based in Japan. As a result, the crews of these ships did not have all of their needed training and certifications. Based on updated data, GAO found that, as of June 2017, 37 percent of the warfare certifications for cruiser and destroyer crews based in Japan—including certifications for seamanship—had expired. This represents more than a fivefold increase in the percentage of expired warfare certifications for these ships since GAO's May 2015 report. The Navy has made plans to revise operational schedules to provide dedicated training time for overseas-based ships, but this schedule has not yet been implemented. Crew size reductions contribute to sailor overwork and safety risks: GAO found in May 2017 that reductions to crew sizes the Navy made in the early 2000s were not analytically supported and may now be creating safety risks. The Navy has reversed some of those changes but continues to use a workweek standard that does not reflect the actual time sailors spend working and does not account for in-port workload—both of which have contributed to some sailors working over 100 hours a week. Inability to complete maintenance on time: Navy recovery from persistently low readiness levels is premised on adherence to maintenance schedules. However, in May 2016, GAO found that the Navy was having difficulty completing maintenance on time. Based on updated data, GAO found that, in fiscal years 2011 through 2016, maintenance overruns on 107 of 169 surface ships (63 percent) resulted in 6,603 lost operational days (i.e., the ships were not available for training and operations). Looking to the future, the Navy wants to grow its fleet by as much as 30 percent but continues to face challenges with manning, training, and maintaining its existing fleet. These readiness problems need to be addressed and will require the Navy to implement GAO's recommendations—particularly in the areas of assessing the risks associated with overseas basing, reassessing sailor workload and the factors used to size ship crews, managing investments to modernize and improve the efficiency of the naval shipyards, and applying sound planning and sustained management attention to its readiness rebuilding efforts. In addition, continued congressional oversight will be needed to ensure that the Navy demonstrates progress in addressing its maintenance, training, and other challenges. GAO made 14 recommendations in prior work cited in this statement. The Department of Defense generally concurred with all of them but has implemented only 1.

There is no single definition of the terms \"runaway youth\" or \"homeless youth.\" However, both groups of youth share the risk of not having adequate shelter and other provisions, and may engage in harmful behaviors while away from a permanent home. Youth most often cite family conflict as the major reason for their homelessness or episodes of running away. A youth's sexual orientation, sexual activity, school problems, and substance abuse are associated with family discord. The precise number of homeless and runaway youth is unknown due to their residential mobility and overlap among the populations. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is supporting data collection efforts, known as Voices of Youth Count, to better determine the number of homeless youth. The 2017 study found that approximately 700,000 youth ages 13 to 17 and 3.5 million young adults ages 18 to 25 experienced homelessness within a 12-month period because they were sleeping in places not meant for habitation, in shelters, or with others while lacking alternative living arrangements. From the early 20th century through the 1960s, the needs of runaway and homeless youth were handled locally through the child welfare agency, juvenile justice courts, or both. The 1970s marked a shift toward federal oversight of programs that help youth who had run afoul of the law, including those who committed status offenses (i.e., a noncriminal act that is considered a violation of the law because of the youth's age). The Runaway Youth Act of 1974 was enacted as Title III of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (P.L. 93-415) to assist runaways through services specifically for this population. The act was amended over time to include homeless youth. It authorizes funding for services carried out under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Program (RHYP), which is administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The program was most recently authorized through FY2020 by the Juvenile Justice Reform Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-385). This law did not make other changes to the RHYP statute. Funding is discretionary, meaning provided through the appropriations process. FY2019 appropriations are $127.4 million. The RHYP program is made up of three components: the Basic Center Program (BCP), Transitional Living Program (TLP), and Street Outreach Program (SOP). The BCP provides temporary shelter, counseling, and after care services to runaway and homeless youth under age 18 and their families. In FY2017, the program served 23,288 youth, and in FY2018 it funded 280 BCP shelters (most recent figures available). The TLP is targeted to older youth ages 16 through 22 (and sometimes an older age). In FY2017, the TLP program served 3,517 youth, and in FY2018 it funded 299 grantees (most recent figures available). Youth who use the TLP receive longer-term housing with supportive services. The SOP provides education, treatment, counseling, and referrals for runaway, homeless, and street youth who have been subjected to, or are at risk of being subjected to, sexual abuse, sex exploitation, and trafficking. In FY2017, the SOP grantees made contact with 24,366 youth. The RHYP is a part of larger federal efforts to end youth homelessness through the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH). The USICH is a coordinating body made up of multiple federal agencies committed to addressing homelessness. The USICH's Opening Doors plan to end homelessness includes strategies for ending youth homelessness by 2020, including through collecting better data and supporting evidence-based practices to improve youth outcomes. Voices of Youth Count is continuing to report on characteristics of homeless youth. In addition to the RHYP, there are other federal supports to address youth homelessness.

DLA Document Services has key DOD-wide responsibilities for (1) printing and reproduction, (2) print device procurement, and (3) electronic content management (e.g., digital document repositories). Other DOD components, including the military services, also maintain some document services capabilities at various locations. House Report 115-200 accompanying a bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2018 included a provision for GAO to examine DOD's document services. This report evaluates (1) the progress DOD has made in achieving efficiencies in its document services and opportunities, if any, to achieve further efficiencies, and (2) the extent to which DOD reports accurate financial information about its document services to key stakeholders. GAO reviewed documents and interviewed officials regarding DOD's efficiency initiatives, including DLA Document Services' transformation plan; reviewed print device procurement contracts and pricing information; and analyzed DOD budget data for fiscal years 2012 through 2016. The Department of Defense (DOD) has taken steps to achieve efficiencies in its document services, including implementing a transformation plan to consolidate existing Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Document Services facilities. However, GAO identified four areas where further gains may be possible: Managing fragmentation in printing and reproduction services. DOD has designated DLA Document Services as the single manager for printing and reproduction services, but DOD customers, citing concerns with DLA's services, have also obtained these services directly from the Government Publishing Office and via in-house print facilities (see fig.). DOD has not assessed DLA's performance in this role or whether additional efficiencies may be possible in light of DLA's transformation plan. Reducing overlap in procuring print devices. GAO found that DOD components used at least four different contract sources to acquire print devices. DOD has not assessed which acquisition approach represents the best value; doing so might better position DOD to further reduce its costs. Meeting goals to reduce the number of print devices. DOD and the military services have not demonstrated that they achieved established goals for reducing the number of print devices. Additional controls and assignment of oversight responsibilities to monitor progress could better enable DOD to achieve its cost savings goals, estimated to be millions of dollars annually. Consolidating DLA facilities. DLA is closing or consolidating 74 of its 112 facilities in the United States. However, GAO found that for four of seven types of specialty services, DLA plans to retain facilities that are responsible for less than 5 percent of the total revenue for each of those specialties, which suggests that further consolidations are possible. DOD includes the cost of non-printing activities, such as the purchase of advertising time for recruiting, within its budget materials for printing and reproduction. It does not include costs to acquire print devices and for electronic content management. As a result, DOD and the Congress lack the oversight into total document services costs needed to make informed decisions. GAO is making six recommendations, including that DOD evaluate options to achieve additional cost savings and other efficiencies in its document services and report more accurate budget data. DOD generally agreed with the recommendations."], "length": 12825}
{"pred": " Passage 2\nThe Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) overtime provisions for executive, administrative, and professional employees (EAP) have undergone several changes over the years. The FLSA authorizes the Secretary of Labor to define and delimit the EAP exemptions, which currently require employees to meet three criteria: a salary basis test, duties test, and salary level test. The salary level threshold has been increased eight times since 1938, with the most recent proposed rule increasing the threshold to $679 per week. The proposed rule would expand overtime coverage to EAP employees making between $455 per week and $679 per week, affecting approximately 4.9 million workers. The rule would also establish a quadrennial update process for the salary level threshold, using data from the Current Population Survey (CPS). The FLSA applies to employees in the U.S. territories, institutions of higher education, and state and local governments, but some employees in these sectors may be exempt from overtime pay due to other provisions of the FLSA. The proposed rule would not change the status quo for congressional staff, as the Congressional Accountability Act (CAA) requires the Office of Compliance to adopt and Congress to approve regulations before they take effect. Overall, the proposed rule aims to update the EAP exemptions to reflect changing wage distributions and provide clearer overtime protections for employees. The key evidence presented includes data from the CPS and estimates of the number of affected workers, while the unique point made is the proposed rule's commitment to updating the salary level threshold every four years. The main argument is that the FLSA overtime provisions need to be updated to reflect changing wage distributions and provide clearer overtime protections for employees. The conclusion is that the proposed rule would expand overtime coverage to approximately 4.9 million workers and establish a quadrennial update process for the salary level threshold.

The conclusion", "answers": ["The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), enacted in 1938, is the main federal law that establishes general wage and hour standards for most, but not all, private and public sector employees. Among other protections, the FLSA establishes that covered nonexempt employees must be compensated at one-and-a-half times their regular rate of pay for each hour worked over 40 hours in a workweek. The FLSA also establishes certain exemptions from its general labor market standards. One of the major exemptions to the overtime provisions in the FLSA is for bona fide \"executive, administrative, and professional\" employees (the \"EAP\" or \"white collar\" exemptions). The FLSA grants authority to the Secretary of Labor to define and delimit the EAP exemption \"from time to time.\" To qualify for this exemption from the FLSA's overtime pay requirement, an employee must be salaried (the \"salary basis\" test); perform specified executive, administrative, or professional duties (the \"duties\" test); and earn above an established salary level threshold (the \"salary level\" test). In March 2019, the Secretary of Labor published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to make changes to the EAP exemptions. The 2019 proposed rule would become effective around January 2020. The major changes in the 2019 proposed rule include increasing the standard salary level threshold from the previous level of $455 per week to $679 per week and committing the Department of Labor (DOL) to updating the EAP exemptions every four years through the rulemaking process. The 2019 proposed rule does not change the duties and responsibilities that employees must perform to be exempt. Thus, the 2019 proposed rule would affect EAP employees at salary levels between $455 and $679 per week in 2020. DOL estimates that about 4.9 million workers would be affected in the first year, including about 1.3 million EAP employees who would become newly entitled to overtime pay and an additional 3.6 million workers who would have overtime protection clarified and thereby strengthened.

The DEA has implemented regulations for the disposal of unused prescription drugs, including the use of disposal bins, mail-back programs, and take-back events. Authorized collectors, such as pharmacies and hospitals, must register with the DEA and follow specific guidelines for the disposal of controlled substances. The DEA has reported that only about 3% of eligible entities have chosen to become authorized collectors, with the majority of these being pharmacies. The participation rates vary by state, with some states having much higher rates of participation than others. The DEA has identified several factors that may contribute to the low participation rates, including the associated costs of participating, uncertainty over proper implementation, and participation in other, similar efforts for disposing of unused prescription drugs. The DEA has also noted that it does not collect information on the extent to which individuals use the prescription drug disposal bins, but estimates that about half of the country's population lives within 5 miles of a disposal bin.

About half of the people who reported misusing prescription drugs in 2015 received them from a friend or relative. One way to help prevent this kind of diversion and potential misuse is by providing secure and convenient ways to dispose of unused, unneeded, or expired prescription medications. The Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010 authorizes pharmacies and other entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances to also collect unused prescription drugs for disposal. In 2014, DEA finalized regulations for the implementation of the Act, establishing a voluntary process for eligible entities to become authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs using disposal bins. GAO was asked to review participation among authorized collectors that maintain disposal bins. In this report GAO describes (1) participation rates among entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs and (2) factors that affect participation. GAO analyzed the most currently available DEA data from April 2017 on entities eligible to participate and those participating as authorized collectors. GAO also conducted interviews with DEA officials and a nongeneralizable sample of 11 stakeholder organizations selected to illustrate different types of authorized collectors and long-term care facilities. GAO is not making any recommendations. DEA provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. GAO found that about 3 percent of pharmacies and other entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs for disposal have volunteered to do so. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) authorizes these entities to dispose of unused drugs to help reduce their potential misuse. Analysis of DEA data shows that as of April 2017, 2,233 of the 89,550 (2.49 percent) eligible entities—that is, certain entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances—had registered with DEA to use disposal bins to collect unused prescription drugs. Most—about 81 percent—of the authorized collectors were pharmacies, followed by hospitals or clinics. GAO also found that participation rates varied by state, though in 44 states less than 5 percent of the state's pharmacies and other eligible entities had registered to become authorized collectors. Stakeholders cited several factors that may explain why relatively few pharmacies and other eligible entities have registered with DEA as authorized collectors of unused drugs. Most notably, stakeholders representing authorized collectors told GAO that because participation is voluntary, the cost associated with maintaining a disposal bin—which includes purchasing and installing the bin according to DEA requirements and paying for the destruction of its contents—is an important factor to weigh against potential benefits.

The process for awarding these medals involves legislation that is typically referred to the House Committee on Financial Services or the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. The legislation includes findings, specifications for awarding the medal, and instructions for the medal's design and striking. The Secretary of the Treasury is responsible for striking the medal, and the design is determined by the Secretary in consultation with the Citizens Coinage Advisory Commission and the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts. There are no specific criteria for determining who or what is worthy of a Congressional Gold Medal, and each individual or group is judged on their merits by Congress. The number of gold medals awarded has increased in recent years, with an average of almost 20 medals awarded per decade in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. The awarding of Congressional Gold Medals is an important way for Congress to express public gratitude for important historical events and achievements. The process for awarding these medals is not codified, and there is no statutory limit on the number of gold medals that can be authorized. Some Members of Congress have proposed legislation to limit the number of gold medals awarded, but this has not been adopted. The awarding of Congressional Gold Medals is a way for Congress to recognize individuals and groups for their patriotic, humanitarian, and artistic achievements.

Since 1776, this award, which initially was bestowed on military leaders, has also been given to such diverse individuals as Sir Winston Churchill and Bob Hope, George Washington and Robert Frost, Joe Louis and Mother Teresa of Calcutta. Congressional gold medal legislation generally has a specific format. Once a gold medal is authorized, it follows a specific process for design, minting, and awarding. This process includes consultation and recommendations by the Citizens Coinage Advisory Commission (CCAC) and the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts (CFA), pursuant to any statutory instructions, before the Secretary of the Treasury makes the final decision on a gold medal's design. Once the medal has been struck, a ceremony will often be scheduled to formally award the medal to the recipient. In recent years, the number of gold medals awarded has increased, and some have expressed interest in examining the gold medal awarding process. Should Congress want to make such changes, several individual and institutional options might be available. The individual options include decisions made by Members of Congress as to what individual or groups might be honored; potential specification of gold medal design elements; and where gold medals for groups might be housed once the award is made.

The review found that from October 2013 to March 2017, the medical centers failed to conduct reviews of 26 providers' clinical care after concerns were raised about their care. The medical centers lacked documentation for these reviews, and in some cases, the required reviews were not conducted at all. The review also found that the medical centers did not always conduct reviews in a timely manner, with some reviews taking multiple years to initiate. The main factors contributing to these shortcomings were inadequate VHA policy and oversight. The review recommended that VHA require documentation of all reviews of providers' clinical care, establish a timeliness requirement for initiating such reviews, and strengthen its oversight to ensure that reviews are conducted and documented in a timely manner. VA concurred with these recommendations and described plans to revise existing policy and update the standardized audit tool used by the networks to include more comprehensive oversight of VA medical centers' reviews of providers' clinical care. The review also found that providers who were not reported to the NPDB and state licensing boards as required were able to obtain privileges at other VA medical centers or hospitals outside of VA's healthcare system, highlighting the need for improved oversight and reporting.

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (VAMC) officials are responsible for reviewing the clinical care delivered by their privileged providers—physicians and dentists who are approved to independently perform specific services—after concerns are raised. The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care. For example, GAO found that after one VAMC failed to report to the NPDB or SLBs a provider who resigned to avoid an adverse privileging action, a non-VA hospital in the same city took an adverse privileging action against that same provider for the same reason 2 years later."], "length": 13360}
{"pred": " \nCluster munitions are weapons that disperse smaller submunitions over an area, causing widespread destruction and civilian casualties. The use of cluster munitions has been criticized due to their imprecise targeting, high failure rate, and long-lasting unexploded ordnance. Despite these concerns, the United States has continued to use cluster munitions, with the Pentagon estimating that up to 80% of U.S. cluster munitions reside in the Army artillery stockpile. In 2008, the U.S. government established a policy requiring cluster munitions to leave less than 1% of unexploded submunitions on the battlefield, but this policy was revised in 2017 to allow for the use of cluster munitions with higher failure rates in extreme situations. The revised policy also does not establish a deadline to replace cluster munitions exceeding the 1% rate, and these munitions will be removed only after new munitions that meet the 1% or less unexploded submunitions standard are fielded in sufficient quantities. The use of cluster munitions has been banned by 105 states, including 18 NATO members, through the Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM), which prohibits the use, development, production, acquisition, transfer, and stockpiling of cluster munitions. However, the United States has not signed the CCM and has continued to use cluster munitions, citing their military utility and the need to minimize harm to civilians and infrastructure. The U.S. military has also been working to develop new technologies to reduce cluster munitions failure rates, including the Army's Alternative Warhead Program (AWP). Despite these efforts, the use of cluster munitions remains a contentious issue, with many arguing that they are an indiscriminate area weapon that is no longer necessary in an era of precision-guided munitions. The U.S. policy reversal on the military use of cluster munitions has also raised concerns about its impact on international military treaty initiatives and the perception of the United States in the international community. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010, prohibits the provision of military assistance for cluster munitions unless they meet certain standards, and subsequent appropriations laws have included similar provisions. The revised U.S. policy on cluster munitions has also raised questions about the effectiveness of cluster munitions in achieving tactical results and the potential for effects-based weapons systems and operations to achieve the same or similar effects without applying a \"kinetic solution\" such as a cluster munition.

Cluster munitions have been highly criticized internationally for causing a significant number of civilian deaths, and efforts have been undertaken to ban and regulate their use. The Department of Defense (DOD) continues to view cluster munitions as a military necessity but in 2008 instituted a policy to reduce the failure rate of cluster munitions to 1% or less after 2018. In November 2017, a new DOD policy was issued that essentially reversed the 2008 policy. Under the new policy, combatant commanders can use cluster munitions that do not meet the 1% or less unexploded submunitions standard in extreme situations to meet immediate warfighting demands. In addition, the new policy does not establish a deadline to replace cluster munitions exceeding the 1% rate and states that DOD \"will retain cluster munitions currently in active inventories until the capabilities they provide are replaced with enhanced and more reliable munitions.\" Potential issues for Congress include cluster munitions in an era of precision weapons, other weapons in lieu of cluster munitions, and the potential impact of DOD's 2017 revised cluster munitions policy."], "length": 12545}

Egypt controls the Suez Canal, which is one of the world's most well-known maritime chokepoints, linking the Mediterranean and Red Seas. Egypt, with its population of more than 100 million people, is by far the most populous Arabic-speaking country. Although it may not play the same type of leading political or military role in the Arab world as it has in the past, Egypt may retain some \"soft power\" by virtue of its history, media, and culture. Cairo plays host both to the 22-member Arab League and Al Azhar University, which claims to be the oldest continuously operating university in the world and has symbolic importance as a leading source of Islamic scholarship. Additionally, Egypt's 1979 peace treaty with Israel remains one of the most significant diplomatic achievements for the promotion of Arab-Israeli peace. While people-to-people relations remain cold, the Israeli and Egyptian governments have increased their cooperation against Islamist militants and instability in the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza Strip. Personnel moves and possible amendments to the Egyptian constitution highlight apparent efforts by President Sisi to consolidate power with the help of political allies, including colleagues from Egypt's security establishment. President Sisi has come under repeated international criticism for an ongoing government crackdown against various forms of political dissent and freedom of expression. The Egyptian government has defended its human rights record, asserting that the country is under pressure from terrorist groups seeking to destabilize Arab nation-states. The Trump Administration has tried to normalize ties with the Sisi government that were generally perceived as strained under President Obama. In January 2019, U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo delivered a major policy speech at the American University in Cairo, where he stated, \"And as we seek an even stronger partnership with Egypt, we encourage President Sisi to unleash the creative energy of Egypt's people, unfetter the economy, and promote a free and open exchange of ideas.\" The United States has provided significant military and economic assistance to Egypt since the late 1970s. Successive U.S. Administrations have justified aid to Egypt as an investment in regional stability, built primarily on long-running cooperation with the Egyptian military and on sustaining the 1979 Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty. All U.S. foreign aid to Egypt (or any recipient) is appropriated and authorized by Congress. Since 1946, the United States has provided Egypt with over $83 billion in bilateral foreign aid (calculated in historical dollars—not adjusted for inflation). Annual appropriations legislation includes several conditions governing the release of these funds. All U.S. military aid to Egypt finances the procurement of weapons systems and services from U.S. defense contractors. For FY2019, Congress has appropriated $1.4 billion in total bilateral assistance for Egypt, the same amount it provided in FY2018. For FY2020, the President is requesting a total of $1.382 billion in bilateral assistance for Egypt. Nearly all of the U.S. funds for Egypt come from the FMF account (military aid). In November 2018, the U.S. Defense Department notified Congress of a major $1 billion sale of defense equipment to Egypt, consisting of 10 AH-64E Apache Attack Helicopters, among other things. Beyond the United States, President Sisi has broadened Egypt's international base of support to include several key partners, including the Arab Gulf states, Israel, Russia, and France.

{"pred": " Passage 1\nThe National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's 2006 report on radiation and human health concluded that the risk of cancer increases with every incremental increase in radiation exposure. The linear no-threshold model, which assumes that the risk of cancer increases with every incremental increase in radiation exposure, is used by federal agencies to set dose limits for radiation exposure. However, there is uncertainty about the extent to which the health effects for non-U.S. populations, such as Japanese atomic bomb survivors, can be extrapolated to a U.S. population that is regularly exposed to low-dose radiation. Despite this uncertainty, federal agencies continue to follow the linear no-threshold model, and the National Academies' 2006 report remains the basis for radiation protection requirements and guidance. The report's estimates of cancer risk have been strengthened by new and more extensive data since its publication in 1990. The linear no-threshold model is used to set dose limits for radiation exposure, and federal agencies have established limits on occupational dose and guidance levels on exposure. The NRC's annual dose limit for members of the public is a hundredth of the level the National Academies considers low dose. The NRC also applies the principle that doses should be kept as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA). The ALARA principle is used to guide the development of radiation protection requirements and guidance. The NRC has established limits on occupational dose and guidance levels on exposure, and the agency has developed a mechanism for interagency collaboration to address overall research priorities related to low-dose radiation health effects. However, the NRC did not agree with the GAO's recommendation to lead the development of a mechanism for interagency collaboration. The GAO believes that an interagency coordination mechanism for low-dose research is needed and that DOE is in the best position to lead agencies in developing the most appropriate mechanism. The GAO recommended that the Secretary of Energy lead the development of a mechanism for interagency collaboration to determine roles and responsibilities for addressing priorities related to research on the health effects of low-dose radiation. The GAO also recommended that VHA require documentation of all reviews of providers' clinical care after concerns have been raised, establish a timeliness requirement for initiating such reviews, and strengthen its oversight by requiring networks to oversee VA medical centers to ensure that such reviews are documented and initiated in a timely manner.

The", "answers": ["This testimony summarizes the information contained in GAO's September 2017 report, entitled Low-Dose Radiation: Interagency Collaboration on Planning Research Could Improve Information on Health Effects ( GAO-17-546 ). The Department of Energy (DOE), Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Food and Drug Administration generally used the advice of scientific advisory bodies to develop and apply radiation protection requirements and guidance for workers and the public in the radiation exposure settings that GAO reviewed. These settings were: (1) the operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants; (2) the cleanup of sites with radiological contamination; (3) the use of medical equipment that produces radiation; and (4) accidental or terrorism-related exposure to radiation. Specifically, the agencies relied on the advice of three scientific advisory bodies that supported the use of a model that assumes the risk of cancer increases with every incremental radiation exposure. Accordingly, the agencies have set regulatory dose limits and issued guidance to confine exposure to levels that reduce the risk of cancer, while recognizing that scientific uncertainties occur in estimating cancer risks from low-dose radiation. For example, NRC requires nuclear power plants to consider measures for limiting workers' exposure below NRC's regulatory dose limit, such as by using robots for maintenance work in radiation areas. GAO identified seven federal agencies that funded research on low-dose radiation's health effects. In fiscal years 2012 to 2016, DOE, NRC, EPA, and four other federal agencies obligated about $210 million for such research . Although the agencies have collaborated on individual projects on radiation's health effects, they have not established a collaborative mechanism to set research priorities. GAO's previous work has shown that federal agencies can use such mechanisms to implement interagency collaboration to develop and coordinate sound science policies. In the past, DOE took a leading role in this area because DOE provided stable funding and advocated for greater coordination on research on low-dose radiation's health effects. However, since fiscal year 2012, DOE has phased out funding for one of its main research programs in this area. This has created a void in coordination efforts among federal agencies, and no other agency has stepped forward to fill this void. Because of DOE's prior experience as a leader in this area of research and its research responsibility under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, it could play an important role in helping federal agencies establish a coordinating mechanism for low-dose radiation research.

{"pred": " \nThe Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) is a federal program that provides free meals to children in low-income areas during the summer months. The program has been in operation since 1968 and is authorized under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act. The SFSP operates during the summer months, vacation periods, and other times when school is not in session. In fiscal years 2007 through 2016, federal expenditures on SFSP increased, with a slight decrease between fiscal years 2015 and 2016. The program is administered at the federal level by the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) and at the state level by state agencies and locally operated by state-approved sponsors. The SFSP provides meals to children in a variety of settings, including schools, parks, community centers, and migrant camps. Meals must meet certain requirements, such as being served and consumed on-site at an approved site, and must include a minimum of four components, including meat, fruits and/or vegetables, bread, and milk. The federal reimbursement rate for SFSP meals is $3.83 or $3.77 per meal, depending on the type of meal site. The program has seen an increase in the number of meals served, with 149 million meals served in fiscal year 2016. However, the estimate of children's participation in the program is unreliable due to inconsistent state methods for calculating average daily attendance (ADA). The FNS has taken steps to address challenges with the program, including providing flexibilities in meal delivery and streamlining options for sponsors participating in multiple child nutrition programs. However, a lack of clarity on the circumstances under which FNS grants flexibilities in areas of violence and crime, and a lack of information on the use of these flexibilities, hinder efforts to ensure program goals are met. The GAO recommends that the FNS improve its estimate of children's participation in the SFSP, communicate the circumstances for approving requests for flexibility, evaluate and report on the use of waivers and demonstration projects, and disseminate information on existing flexibilities available to state agencies to streamline administrative requirements. The GAO also notes that the FNS has taken steps to address challenges with the program, but more work is needed to ensure the program's goals are met. The SFSP is an important program that provides meals to children in low-income areas during the summer months, but it faces challenges that need to be addressed to ensure its success. The GAO's recommendations aim to improve the program's effectiveness and ensure that it meets its goals", "answers": ["The SFSP, a federal nutrition assistance program, is intended to provide food to children in low-income areas during periods when area schools are closed for vacation. In the last decade, federal expenditures for SFSP have increased as the program has expanded, according to USDA data. GAO was asked to review the SFSP. This report examines (1) what is known about SFSP participation, (2) other programs that help feed low-income children over the summer, and (3) challenges, if any, in providing summer meals to children and the extent to which USDA provides assistance to address these challenges. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed USDA's SFSP data for fiscal years 2007 through 2016; surveyed state agencies responsible for administering the SFSP in 50 states and the District of Columbia; visited a nongeneralizable group of 3 states and 30 meal sites, selected based on Census data on child poverty rates and urban and rural locations; analyzed meal site data from the 3 states; and interviewed USDA, state and national organization officials, and SFSP providers, including sponsors and site operators. Nationwide, the total number of meals served to children in low-income areas through the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) increased from 113 to 149 million (about 32 percent) from fiscal year 2007 through 2016. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) directs states to use the number of meals served, along with other data, to estimate the number of children participating in the SFSP. However, participation estimates have been calculated inconsistently from state to state and year to year. In 2017, USDA took steps to improve the consistency of participation estimates, noting they are critical for informing program implementation and strategic planning. However, GAO determined that the method USDA directs states to use will continue to provide unreliable estimates of participation, hindering USDA's ability to use them for these purposes. Other federal and nonfederal programs help feed low-income children over the summer to some extent, according to states GAO surveyed and SFSP providers and others GAO interviewed. For example, in July 2016, USDA data indicate about 26 million meals were served through a separate federal program that allows school meal providers to serve summer meals. Some children also received summer meals through nonfederal programs operated by faith-based organizations and foodbanks, though GAO's state survey and interviews with providers and national organizations indicate the reach of such efforts is limited. States and SFSP providers reported challenges with meal sites, participation, and program administration; USDA has taken steps to address these areas. Specifically, in GAO's survey, a majority of states reported challenges with availability and awareness of meal sites, as well as limited program participation and administrative capacity. National, state, and local officials have taken steps to address these issues, such as increasing outreach and offering activities to attract participation. In addition, 17 states in GAO's survey and providers in the states GAO visited reported a challenge with ensuring meal sites are in safe locations. To address this safety issue, USDA has granted some states and sponsors flexibility from the requirement that children consume meals on-site. However, USDA has not broadly communicated the circumstances it considers when granting this flexibility. Further, some states and sponsors that have requested this flexibility reported difficulty obtaining data to show these circumstances exist, hampering their ability to ensure safe meal delivery. GAO is making four recommendations, including that USDA improve estimates of children's participation in SFSP and communicate the circumstances it considers when granting flexibilities to ensure safe meal delivery. USDA generally agreed with GAO's recommendations."], "length": 13319}

The User Interface presented various concepts, including voice recognition, a spinning wheel, and a scroll button with integrated push-button. However, the team decided to omit the touch screen in favor of voice recognition, citing cost concerns and the need to prioritize features. The User Interface suggested that the voice recognition system could be used to create a more user-friendly interface, and the team agreed to focus on this feature. The team also discussed the casing and materials, considering options such as rubber, wood, and leather. They decided to use a rubber-like material for the case, which would provide a durable and tactile experience. The team also discussed the possibility of using a round, non-remote-looking design, which would be more aesthetically pleasing and easier to use. The User Interface suggested that this design could be inspired by Apple's products, such as the iPod and iMac. The team agreed to work together to create a prototype, with the User Interface and Industrial Designer focusing on the design and the Marketing team working on the branding and marketing strategy. The team decided to have a follow-up meeting in half an hour to discuss the next steps and assign tasks. The Project Manager assigned tasks to the team members, asking the User Interface to work on the design and the Industrial Designer to focus on the materials and casing.

DOD's document services are provided by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Document Services, which has a transformation plan to transition from on-site printing to digital services. The plan aims to reduce costs by 20% and consolidate facilities from 112 to 38. However, DOD has not assessed whether DLA Document Services' single manager role for printing and reproduction provides the best value to the government. Additionally, DOD has not demonstrated that it has achieved its goals for reducing the number of print devices, and there are limitations in internal controls. Furthermore, DOD's O&M budget materials for printing and reproduction activities include information on non-printing activities that make up a larger portion of its reported spending than printing does. The report makes six recommendations to DOD to improve its document services, including assessing the single manager role and evaluating options to report more accurate funding information.\n\nThe Public Safety Officers' Benefits (PSOB) program provides cash benefits to federal, state, and local law enforcement officers, firefighters, and emergency medical services workers who are killed or permanently and totally disabled in the line of duty. The program is administered by the Department of Justice (DOJ) and provides a lump-sum death benefit of $359,316 and a monthly disability benefit of $1,224. To be eligible for PSOB benefits, a public safety officer must have served in a public agency in an official capacity and have been injured or killed in the line of duty. The PSOB program covers a public safety officer's death or disability if it occurred as the result of an injury incurred in the line of duty. The program also provides financial assistance with costs associated with higher education to the spouse or children of a public safety officer who is eligible for PSOB death or disability benefits.

DLA Document Services has key DOD-wide responsibilities for (1) printing and reproduction, (2) print device procurement, and (3) electronic content management (e.g., digital document repositories). Other DOD components, including the military services, also maintain some document services capabilities at various locations. House Report 115-200 accompanying a bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2018 included a provision for GAO to examine DOD's document services. This report evaluates (1) the progress DOD has made in achieving efficiencies in its document services and opportunities, if any, to achieve further efficiencies, and (2) the extent to which DOD reports accurate financial information about its document services to key stakeholders. GAO reviewed documents and interviewed officials regarding DOD's efficiency initiatives, including DLA Document Services' transformation plan; reviewed print device procurement contracts and pricing information; and analyzed DOD budget data for fiscal years 2012 through 2016. The Department of Defense (DOD) has taken steps to achieve efficiencies in its document services, including implementing a transformation plan to consolidate existing Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Document Services facilities. However, GAO identified four areas where further gains may be possible: Managing fragmentation in printing and reproduction services. DOD has designated DLA Document Services as the single manager for printing and reproduction services, but DOD customers, citing concerns with DLA's services, have also obtained these services directly from the Government Publishing Office and via in-house print facilities (see fig.). DOD has not assessed DLA's performance in this role or whether additional efficiencies may be possible in light of DLA's transformation plan. Reducing overlap in procuring print devices. GAO found that DOD components used at least four different contract sources to acquire print devices. DOD has not assessed which acquisition approach represents the best value; doing so might better position DOD to further reduce its costs. Meeting goals to reduce the number of print devices. DOD and the military services have not demonstrated that they achieved established goals for reducing the number of print devices. Additional controls and assignment of oversight responsibilities to monitor progress could better enable DOD to achieve its cost savings goals, estimated to be millions of dollars annually. Consolidating DLA facilities. DLA is closing or consolidating 74 of its 112 facilities in the United States. However, GAO found that for four of seven types of specialty services, DLA plans to retain facilities that are responsible for less than 5 percent of the total revenue for each of those specialties, which suggests that further consolidations are possible. DOD includes the cost of non-printing activities, such as the purchase of advertising time for recruiting, within its budget materials for printing and reproduction. It does not include costs to acquire print devices and for electronic content management. As a result, DOD and the Congress lack the oversight into total document services costs needed to make informed decisions.

These challenges can lead to project delays, cancellations, or suspensions. A recent study found that two-thirds of U.S.-based nonprofit organizations (NPOs) that work internationally experience banking access challenges. The main reasons for these challenges are due diligence requirements, sanctions, and de-risking by banks. USAID's current reporting system does not capture information on banking access challenges, making it difficult for the agency to help its partners mitigate these challenges. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommends that USAID take steps to collect information on banking access challenges and communicate this information to external entities. The GAO also notes that USAID's limited engagement with other agencies and NPOs on banking access challenges hinders its ability to effectively address these challenges. The report highlights the need for improved communication and collaboration among USAID, its partners, and other stakeholders to address banking access challenges and ensure the effective delivery of humanitarian assistance. Key evidence includes a survey of 300 NPOs, which found that 70% of respondents experienced banking access challenges, and a review of 1,300 USAID partner reports, which found that only 5 reports mentioned banking access challenges. The report also notes that USAID's current reporting system does not capture information on banking access challenges, making it difficult for the agency to help its partners mitigate these challenges.

State officials reported occasional banking access challenges, including short delays in funds transfers, denials of funds transfers to certain countries, and one bank-initiated account closure. However, State was able to mitigate these challenges and ensure operations were not affected. The report highlights the importance of effective communication and collaboration", "answers": ["Since 2012, the United States has provided approximately $36 billion in humanitarian assistance to save lives and alleviate human suffering. Much of this assistance is provided in areas plagued by conflict or other issues that increase the risk of financial crimes. The World Bank and others have reported that humanitarian assistance organizations face challenges in accessing banking services that could affect project implementation. GAO was asked to review the possible effects of decreased banking access for nonprofit organizations on the delivery of U.S. humanitarian assistance. In this report, GAO examines (1) the extent to which State and USAID partners experienced banking access challenges, (2) USAID partners' reporting on such challenges, and (3) actions U.S. agencies have taken to help address such challenges. GAO selected four high-risk countries—Syria, Somalia, Haiti, and Kenya—based on factors such as their inclusion in multiple financial risk-related indices, and selected a non-generalizable sample of 18 projects in those countries. GAO reviewed documentation and interviewed U.S. officials and the 18 partners for the selected projects. Implementing partners (partners) for 7 of 18 Department of State (State) and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) humanitarian assistance projects that GAO selected noted encountering banking access challenges, such as delays or denials in transferring funds overseas. Of those 7 projects, 1 partner told us that banking access challenges adversely affected its project and 2 additional partners told us that the challenges had the potential for adverse effects. Moreover, the majority of partners (15 out of 18) for the 18 projects noted experiencing banking access challenges on their global portfolio of projects over the previous 5 years. USAID's partners' written reports do not capture potential risks posed by banking access challenges because USAID generally does not require most partners to report in writing any challenges that do not affect implementation. Six of the 7 projects that encountered challenges were USAID-funded. Of those 6 USAID projects, 5 partners told us that these challenges did not rise to the threshold of affecting project implementation that would necessitate reporting, and 1 did not report challenges although its project was adversely affected. Additionally, GAO's review of about 1,300 USAID partner reports found that the few instances where challenges were mentioned lacked sufficient detail for GAO to determine their type, severity, or origin. Without information on banking access challenges that pose potential risks to project implementation, USAID is not aware of the full extent of risks to achieving its objectives. The Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and State have taken various actions to help address banking access challenges encountered by nonprofit organizations (NPO), but USAID's efforts have been limited. Treasury's efforts have focused on engagement between NPOs and U.S. agencies, while State has issued guidance on the topic to its embassies and designated an office to focus on these issues. In contrast, USAID lacks a comparable office, and NPOs stated that it is difficult to find USAID staff to engage with on this topic. Further, GAO found that awareness of specific challenges was generally limited to USAID staff directly overseeing the project. Without communicating these challenges to relevant parties, USAID may not be aware of all risks to agency objectives and may not be able to effectively engage with external entities on efforts to address these challenges. GAO recommends that USAID should take steps to (1) collect information on banking access challenges experienced by USAID's partners and (2) communicate that information both within USAID and with external entities, such as other U.S. agencies and partners.

MYP is a contracting mechanism that allows DOD to use a single contract for two to five years' worth of procurement of a given kind of item, without having to exercise a contract option for each year after the first year. BBC is similar to MYP but does not have a permanent statute governing its use. The report highlights the potential savings of MYP and BBC, which can range from 5% to 15% compared to annual contracting. The report also discusses the criteria for qualifying for MYP, including significant savings, realistic cost estimates, stable need for the items, and stable design for the items. The report concludes that MYP and BBC can reduce procurement costs, but also notes that they can reduce Congress's and DOD's flexibility for making changes in procurement programs in future years.\n\nPassage 2 discusses the oversight of clinical care reviews at five VA medical centers.

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (VAMC) officials are responsible for reviewing the clinical care delivered by their privileged providers—physicians and dentists who are approved to independently perform specific services—after concerns are raised. The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs.

GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care.

{"pred": " Passage 2\nThe federal government operates four regional power marketing administrations (PMAs) through the Department of Energy. These PMAs are responsible for marketing and transmitting electric power produced by federal dams. The PMAs are self-financed, with the exception of the Southwestern Power Administration (SWPA), which relies on congressional appropriations. The Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) is the largest PMA in terms of transmission system size, and it operates in the Pacific Northwest. BPA has a unique financing structure, with a permanent Treasury borrowing authority, and it has been exploring alternative financing options to address its debt limit. The Southeastern Power Administration (SEPA) is the smallest PMA, with a limited service area and a reliance on contracting with other utilities for transmission. The Southwestern Power Administration (SWPA) markets hydroelectric power in six states and has a unique financing structure, relying on alternative financing and offsetting collection authorities. The Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) is the largest PMA in terms of service area, covering 1.3 million square miles, and it has a diverse customer base, including Native American tribes. WAPA has been exploring new transmission projects and has joined the Southwest Power Pool, a Regional Transmission Organization. The Trump Administration proposed selling federal transmission assets owned and operated by the PMAs, but the proposal was dropped due to stakeholder opposition. The PMAs are subject to various laws and regulations, including the Flood Control Act of 1944 and the Reclamation Project Act of 1939, which stipulate a preference for publicly or cooperatively owned utilities to purchase federal power. Overall, the PMAs play a critical role in providing electricity to customers in the western United States, and their operations and financing structures are subject to various laws and regulations.

The PMAs'", "answers": ["The federal government, through the Department of Energy, operates four regional power marketing administrations (PMAs), created by statute: the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), the Southeastern Power Administration (SEPA), the Southwestern Power Administration (SWPA), and the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA). Each PMA operates in a distinct geographic area. Congressional interest in the PMAs has included diverse issues such as rate setting, cost and compliance associated with the Endangered Species Act (ESA; P.L. 93-205; 16 U.S.C. §§1531 et seq.), and questions of privatization of these federal agencies. In general, the PMAs came into being because of the government's need to dispose of electric power produced by dams constructed largely for irrigation, flood control, or other purposes, and to achieve small community and farm electrification—that is, providing service to customers whom it would not have been profitable for a private utility to serve. With minor exceptions, these agencies market the electric power produced by federal dams constructed, owned, and operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) and the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR). By statute, PMAs must give preference to public utility districts and cooperatives (e.g., \"preference customers\"), and sell their power at cost-based rates set at the lowest possible rate consistent with sound business principles. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulates PMA rates to ensure that they are set high enough to repay the U.S. Treasury for the portion of federal facility costs allocated to hydropower beneficiaries. With energy and capacity markets changing in the western United States (especially with the growing need to integrate increasing amounts of variable renewable sources), and the development of the Energy Imbalance Market in the West, BPA and WAPA may have to adapt their plans with regard to generation needs and how transmission systems are developed. In 2018, the Trump Administration proposed to sell the transmission assets (lines, towers, substations, and/or rights of way) owned and operated by the federal Power Marketing Administrations. The proposal suggested that \"eliminating or reducing\" the federal government's role in owning and operating transmission assets, and increasing the private sector's role, would \"encourage a more efficient allocation of economic resources and mitigate unnecessary risk to taxpayers.\" The resulting PMA entities would then contract with other utilities to provide transmission services for the delivery of federal power, similar to what SEPA does currently. Reportedly, the proposed sale of PMA assets was dropped after opposition to the plan emerged from stakeholders. Under Section 208 of the Urgent Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1986 (P.L. 99-349), the executive branch is prohibited from spending funds to study or draft proposals to transfer from federal control any portion of the assets of the PMAs unless specifically authorized by Congress. Environmental, fishing, and tribal advocates have sued the federal government over concerns that operating rules for hydropower dams on the Columbia and Snake Rivers (i.e., the National Marine Fisheries Service Biological Opinion) are inadequate to ensure survival of species threatened or endangered under the ESA. In 2016, a federal judge overturned a previous management plan for the dams, finding that it would not be sufficient to protect salmon runs, and ordered a new management plan that could include removing the dams. However, in 2018, President Trump issued a Presidential Memorandum accelerating the process for a new management plan, requiring the biological opinion to be ready by 2020. Since FY2011, power revenues associated with the PMAs have been classified as discretionary offsetting receipts (i.e., receipts that are available for spending by the PMAs), thus the agencies are sometimes noted as having a \"net-zero\" spending authority. Only the capital expenses of WAPA and SWPA require appropriations from Congress."], "length": 13305}

{"pred": " Passage 1\nThe passage discusses the concept of funding gaps in the federal government, which occur when appropriations for a particular project or activity are not enacted into law. This can happen at the start of the fiscal year or at any time a continuing resolution (CR) expires and another CR or regular appropriations bill is not enacted immediately. The passage explains that the Antideficiency Act bars the obligation or expenditure of federal funds in the absence of appropriations. In the event of a funding gap, executive agencies begin a shutdown of affected projects and activities, including the furlough of non-excepted personnel. The passage also notes that a shutdown may not always result in a funding gap, and that the two events should be distinguished. The passage provides a historical context of funding gaps, noting that there have been 20 funding gaps since FY1977, with the majority occurring between FY1977 and FY1995. The passage concludes by highlighting the importance of avoiding funding gaps and proposes the establishment of an \"automatic continuing resolution\" (ACR) to provide a fallback source of funding authority for activities in the event of a funding gap. Key evidence presented includes the historical data on funding gaps, the Antideficiency Act, and the guidelines provided by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for handling funding gaps. Unique points made in the passage include the distinction between funding gaps and shutdowns, and the proposal for an ACR to avoid funding gaps. Overall, the passage provides a comprehensive overview of the concept of funding gaps and their implications for the federal government.", "answers": ["The Antideficiency Act (31 U.S.C. 1341-1342, 1511-1519) generally bars the obligation of funds in the absence of appropriations. Exceptions are made under the act, including for activities involving \"the safety of human life or the protection of property.\" The interval during the fiscal year when appropriations for a particular project or activity are not enacted into law, either in the form of a regular appropriations act or a continuing resolution (CR), is referred to as a funding gap or funding lapse. Although funding gaps may occur at the start of the fiscal year, they may also occur any time a CR expires and another CR (or the regular appropriations bill) is not enacted immediately thereafter. Multiple funding gaps may occur within a fiscal year. When a funding gap occurs, federal agencies are generally required to begin a shutdown of the affected projects and activities, which includes the prompt furlough of non-excepted personnel. The general practice of the federal government after the shutdown has ended has been to retroactively pay furloughed employees for the time they missed, as well as employees who were required to come to work. Although a shutdown may be the result of a funding gap, the two events should be distinguished. This is because a funding gap may result in a total shutdown of all affected projects or activities in some instances but not others. For example, when funding gaps are of a short duration, agencies may not have enough time to complete a shutdown of affected projects and activities before funding is restored. In addition, the Office of Management and Budget has previously indicated that a shutdown of agency operations within the first day of the funding gap may be postponed if a resolution appears to be imminent. Since FY1977, 20 funding gaps occurred, ranging in duration from 1 day to 34 full days. These funding gaps are listed in Table 1. About half of these funding gaps were brief (i.e., three days or less in duration). Notably, many of the funding gaps do not appear to have resulted in a \"shutdown.\" Prior to the issuance of the opinions in 1980 and early 1981 by then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti, while agencies tended to curtail some operations in response to a funding gap, they often \"continued to operate during periods of expired funding.\" In addition, some of the funding gaps after the Civiletti opinions did not result in a completion of shutdown operations due to both the funding gap's short duration and an expectation that appropriations would soon be enacted. Some of the funding gaps during this period, however, did have a broader impact on affected government operations, even if only for a matter of hours. Two funding gaps occurred in FY1996, amounting to 5 days and 21 days. The chronology of regular and continuing appropriations enacted during FY1996 is illustrated in Figure 1. At the beginning of FY2014 (October 1, 2013), none of the regular appropriations bills had been enacted, so a government-wide funding gap occurred. It concluded on October 17, 2013, after lasting 16 full days. During FY2018, there was a funding gap when a CR covering all of the regular appropriations bills expired on January 19, 2018. It concluded on January 22, 2018, after lasting two full days. The most recent funding gap occurred during FY2019, when a CR covering federal agencies and activities funded in 7 of the 12 regular appropriations bills expired on December 21, 2018. It concluded on January 25, 2019, after lasting 34 full days.

{"pred": " Passage 1\nThe CHIP-IN Act was enacted to allow the VA to accept private donations for the construction of medical facilities. The act was motivated by the uncertainty of when or if the VA would be able to build a replacement medical center in Omaha. The VA and an Omaha donor group discussed a change in the scope of the project from a replacement medical center to a smaller ambulatory care center that could be constructed using existing appropriations and private donations. The CHIP-IN Act authorized five pilot projects, but did not name specific locations. The Omaha donor group applied to participate in the pilot program, and the VA executed a donation agreement in April 2017. The agreement required the donor group to conduct environmental and historic preservation due diligence, obtain permits, and use construction standards required of the VA. The facility will provide approximately 158,000 gross square feet of outpatient clinical functions and will be completed at a cost of $86 million, with the VA contributing $56 million and the donor group donating the remaining $30 million. The VA has not yet established clear objectives for the pilot program, which is necessary for effective implementation and evaluation. The VA has not developed an assessment methodology or evaluation plan, and has not determined how to make decisions about scalability. The pilot program is a unique opportunity for the VA to test a new approach to building medical facilities using non-federal funding sources. However, without a strengthened pilot design, it may not be clear to the VA and Congress whether the CHIP-IN approach could be part of a longer-term strategy. The VA has begun to implement the pilot program, but has not yet documented roles and responsibilities for the pilot, and has not identified the resources needed to effectively implement the pilot. The VA has not yet collected the information it needs to support decisions by the VA or Congress about the pilot. The GAO recommends that the Secretary of VA ensure that internal stakeholders agree to and document clear, measurable objectives for the CHIP-IN pilot, develop an assessment methodology and evaluation plan, and document the roles and responsibilities of the CHIP-IN steering committee. The GAO also recommends that the Secretary of VA ensure that the CHIP-IN steering committee documents the roles and responsibilities of its members and identifies available staff resources, including any additional expertise and skills that are needed to implement the CHIP-IN pilot program. The GAO has provided a draft of this report to the VA for comment, and the VA has concurred with the recommendations. The report is available at no charge on the GAO website.

The Communities Helping Invest through Property and Improvements Needed for Veterans Act of 2016 (CHIP-IN Act) authorized VA to accept donated real property—such as buildings or facility construction or improvements—through a pilot program. VA has initiated one project in Omaha, Nebraska, through a partnership with a donor group. VA can accept up to five donations through the pilot program, which is authorized through 2021. The CHIP-IN Act includes a provision for GAO to report on donation agreements. This report (1) examines the extent to which the VA's pilot design aligns with leading practices and (2) discusses what VA has learned from the pilot to date. GAO reviewed VA documents, including plans for the pilot program, and visited the Omaha pilot project. GAO interviewed VA officials, the Omaha donor group, and three non-federal entities that responded to VA's request seeking donors. GAO compared implementation of VA's pilot to leading practices for pilot design, organizational transformation, and cross-functional teams. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is conducting a pilot program, called CHIP-IN, that allows VA to partner with non-federal entities and accept real property donations from them as a way to help address VA's infrastructure needs. Although VA signed its first project agreement under the program in April 2017, VA has not yet established a framework for effective design of the pilot program. Specifically, VA's pilot program design is not aligned with four of five leading practices for designing a well-developed and documented pilot program. VA has begun to implement one leading practice by improving its efforts to communicate with relevant stakeholders, such as including external stakeholders in key meetings. However, the VA offices involved have not agreed upon and documented clear, measurable objectives for the pilot program, which is a leading practice. Further, VA has not developed an assessment methodology or an evaluation plan that would help inform decisions about whether or how the pilot approach could be expanded. While VA officials said they intend to develop these items as tasks for the newly formed CHIP-IN steering committee, they have no timeline for doing so. Without clear objectives and assessment and evaluation plans, VA and Congress may have difficulty determining whether the pilot approach is an effective way to help address VA's infrastructure needs. To date, the CHIP-IN pilot suggests that donation partnerships could improve construction projects, but identifying donors and establishing a team for the pilot program have presented challenges. Officials from VA and the donor group for the first pilot project—an ambulatory care center in Omaha, Nebraska—said they are completing the project faster than if it had been a standard federal construction project, while achieving potential cost savings by using private sector practices. However, VA officials said it is challenging to find partners to make large donations with no financial return, and VA's lack of marketing and philanthropic development experience exacerbates that challenge. VA and the donor group agreed that a dedicated team of individuals with relevant expertise could facilitate the pilot's implementation. The new CHIP-IN steering committee could serve this purpose, but it lacks documented roles and responsibilities. Establishing a team with clear roles and responsibilities and identifying both available and needed staff resources could assist VA in partnering with additional donors and creating new opportunities to meet veterans' needs. GAO is recommending that VA: (1) establish pilot program objectives, (2) develop an assessment methodology and an evaluation plan, and (3) document roles and responsibilities and identify available and needed staff resources.

{"pred": " \nThe rise of e-commerce has led to a shift in the market for counterfeit goods, with counterfeiters now selling their products through primary markets, including e-commerce websites, corporate and government supply chains, and traditional retail stores. This shift has made it more difficult for law enforcement to distinguish between legitimate and counterfeit goods, and for rights holders and e-commerce websites to identify and investigate individual counterfeit cases. The changing marketplace also presents challenges to CBP and ICE, including the need to screen a wider variety of goods and the use of smaller express shipments to decrease the risk of losing significant quantities of merchandise to a single seizure. To address these challenges, CBP and ICE engage in various activities, including detecting imports of potentially IPR-infringing goods, conducting special operations at U.S. ports, and engaging with international partners. However, CBP has limited evaluation of its efforts to enhance IPR enforcement, and we recommended that CBP take steps to evaluate the effectiveness of its IPR enforcement efforts. Additionally, we found that CBP and ICE interagency collaboration on IPR enforcement is generally consistent with key practices for effective interagency collaboration, and that information shared by law enforcement entities is critical to private sector IPR enforcement. However, restrictions on the amount and type of information about seized items shared by CBP limit the ability of rights holders and e-commerce websites to protect IPR, and we recommended that CBP assess what, if any, additional information would be beneficial to share with the private sector and take action to enhance information sharing where possible. Overall, the rise of e-commerce has created new challenges for law enforcement and the private sector in addressing the issue of counterfeit goods, and requires a coordinated effort to protect intellectual property rights.  The GAO report highlights the need for CBP to evaluate the effectiveness of its IPR enforcement efforts and to enhance information sharing with the private sector to better protect IPR. The report also emphasizes the importance of interagency collaboration between CBP and ICE in addressing the issue of counterfeit goods. The GAO report provides recommendations for CBP and ICE to improve their IPR enforcement efforts and to better protect IPR in the e-commerce marketplace.

Changes in the market for counterfeit goods entering the United States pose new challenges for consumers, the private sector, and U.S. agencies that enforce intellectual property rights (IPR). Specifically, growth in e-commerce has contributed to a shift in the sale of counterfeit goods in the United States, with consumers increasingly purchasing goods online and counterfeiters producing a wider variety of goods that may be sold on websites alongside authentic products. For example, 20 of 47 items GAO purchased from third-party sellers on popular consumer websites were counterfeit, according to testing by the products' rights holders (see table), highlighting potential risks to consumers. The changes in the market for counterfeit goods can also pose challenges to the private sector—for example, the challenge of distinguishing counterfeit from authentic goods listed for sale online—and complicate the enforcement efforts of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). CBP and ICE engage in a number of activities to enhance IPR enforcement; however, while ICE has assessed some of its efforts, CBP has taken limited steps to do so. CBP's and ICE's IPR enforcement activities broadly include detecting imports of potentially IPR-infringing goods, conducting special operations at U.S. ports, engaging with international partners, and undertaking localized pilot programs or port-led initiatives. CBP and ICE have collected some performance data for each of the eight activities GAO reviewed, and ICE has taken some steps to understand the impact of its efforts. However, CBP has conducted limited evaluation of its efforts to enhance IPR enforcement. Consequently, CBP may lack information needed to ensure it is investing its resources in the most efficient and effective activities. CBP and ICE generally collaborate on IPR enforcement, but according to private sector representatives, restrictions on CBP's information sharing limit private sector enforcement efforts. GAO found that CBP and ICE have undertaken efforts that align with selected key practices for interagency collaboration, such as participating in developing a national IPR enforcement strategy and agreeing on roles and responsibilities. However, sharing additional information about seized items with rights-holding companies and e-commerce websites could improve enforcement, according to private sector representatives. CBP officials said they share information to the extent allowed under current regulations, but CBP has not completed an assessment of what, if any, additional information would be beneficial to share with private sector entities. Without such an assessment, CBP will not know if sharing additional information requires regulatory or legal changes."], "length": 13264}

Overall,", "answers": ["The LDA, as amended, requires lobbyists to file quarterly disclosure reports and semiannual reports on certain political contributions. The law also includes a provision for GAO to annually audit lobbyists' compliance with the LDA. GAO's objectives were to (1) determine the extent to which lobbyists can demonstrate compliance with disclosure requirements, (2) identify challenges to compliance that lobbyists report, and (3) describe the resources and authorities available to USAO in its role in enforcing LDA compliance, and the efforts USAO has made to improve enforcement. This is GAO's 11th report under the provision. GAO reviewed a stratified random sample of 98 quarterly disclosure LD-2 reports filed for the third and fourth quarters of calendar year 2016 and the first and second quarters of calendar year 2017. GAO also reviewed two random samples totaling 160 LD-203 reports from year-end 2016 and midyear 2017. This methodology allowed GAO to generalize to the population of 45,818 disclosure reports with $5,000 or more in lobbying activity, and 30,594 reports of federal political campaign contributions. GAO also met with officials from USAO to obtain status updates on its efforts to focus resources on lobbyists who fail to comply. GAO is not making any recommendations in this report. GAO provided a draft of this report to the Department of Justice for review and comment. The Department of Justice provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. For the 2017 reporting period, most lobbyists provided documentation for key elements of their disclosure reports to demonstrate compliance with the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995, as amended (LDA). For lobbying disclosure (LD-2) reports and political contributions (LD-203) reports filed during the third and fourth quarter of 2016 and the first and second quarter of 2017, GAO estimates that 87 percent of lobbyists filed reports as required for the quarter in which they first registered; the figure below describes the filing process and enforcement; 99 percent of all lobbyists who filed (up from 83 percent in 2016) could provide documentation for income and expenses; and 93 percent filed year-end 2016 LD-203 reports as required. These findings are generally consistent with prior reports GAO issued for the 2010 through 2016 reporting periods. However, in recent years GAO's findings showed some variation in the estimated percentage of reports with supporting documentation. For example, an estimated increase in lobbyists who could document expenses is notable in 2017 and represents a statistically significant increase from 2016. As in GAO's other reports, some lobbyists were still unclear about the need to disclose certain previously held covered positions, such as paid congressional internships or certain executive agency positions. GAO estimates that 15 percent of all LD-2 reports may not have properly disclosed previously held covered positions. On the other hand, over the past several years of reporting on lobbying disclosure, GAO found that most lobbyists in the sample rated the terms associated with LD-2 reporting as “very easy” or “somewhat easy” to understand.

The passage highlights the challenges DOD faces in determining the costs of contractor personnel, including the lack of a centralized database on service-contractor pay. DOD's Cost-Comparison Report found that for the 21,000 federal civilians and service contractors compared, neither federal civilians nor service contractors were predominately more or less expensive, with the costs being dependent upon the function being performed, location, and level of expertise. However, the report excluded certain non-labor costs from its cost calculations, including direct non-labor costs for government-owned facilities and government-provided supplies, indirect costs for general and administrative and overhead for civilians, and costs to manage contracts. The passage concludes that DOD partially addressed the reporting element to account for the full cost of civilian and contractor personnel, but did not fully address the mandate. The GAO report notes that DOD's methodology for estimating and comparing the full costs of civilian and contractor personnel is incomplete and that the department needs to improve its methodology to accurately compare the costs of different workforces. The passage also highlights the importance of accurate workforce data in supporting better-informed leadership decisions and improving the accuracy of analyses.

The Senate report also included a provision for GAO to assess DOD's report, which DOD submitted to Congress in April 2017. This report examines the extent to which DOD's report addressed the prescribed congressional elements. GAO reviewed DOD's report and compared it to the prescribed elements, examined documents relevant to DOD's cost estimating and comparison methodology, and interviewed DOD officials, including those in its Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation responsible for the calculations in DOD's report. In response to Congressional direction, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a report in April 2017 comparing the costs of federal civilian and service contractor personnel at select installations. The report addressed three out of four provision elements and partially addressed one, as discussed below. DOD concluded that neither federal civilians nor service contractors were predominately more or less expensive, with costs being dependent on position, location, and level of seniority. DOD noted that it used a non-probability based sample of personnel for its report, and the results are not generalizable. An assessment of performance of functions being performed by federal civilian and service contractor personnel at six military installations, with four being in the continental United States and two being outside the continental United States. GAO believes that DOD addressed this requirement because it developed a methodology to assess performance of functions performed by federal civilians and service contractors at 17 organizations within nine geographic regions including two locations outside the continental United States. DOD used data from the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System to identify military installations with large reported numbers of federal civilians. DOD determined that personnel need to perform at least 80 percent common tasks to be able to make a comparison. An accounting of the fully-burdened, or full, cost of federal civilian and service contractor personnel performing functions at the selected installations including training, benefits, reimbursable costs, and facility overhead. GAO believes that DOD partially addressed this requirement because while it calculated the labor costs of selected federal civilian and service contractor full-time equivalents performing similar functions for organizations at government-owned facilities, it excluded certain non-labor costs from its calculations. A comparison of the costs of performance of these functions by federal civilians and service contractor personnel at the selected installations.

The TRIO project, which aimed to modernize the financial management systems of the U.S. Coast Guard, Transportation Security Administration, and Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, has experienced significant challenges, including delays, cost overruns, and a lack of sufficient, reliable cost and schedule information. The project's risk management efforts have also been inadequate, with the DHS risk register containing missing data and not accurately reflecting the status of risks. The GAO has identified 22 best practices for conducting an analysis of alternatives (AOA) process, which the TRIO components did not always follow.

The GAO also recommends that DHS improve the Risk Management Planning Handbook and other relevant guidance for managing risks associated with financial management system modernization projects. DHS has concurred with these recommendations and has taken steps to address them. The TRIO project represents a key element of DHS's efforts to address long-standing deficiencies in its financial management systems, and following best practices to manage risks effectively can help provide increased assurance that large, complex projects will achieve planned objectives.

House Report Number 3128 included a provision for GAO to assess the risks of DHS using IBC in connection with its modernization efforts. This report examines (1) the extent to which DHS and the TRIO components followed best practices in analyzing alternatives, and the key factors, metrics, and processes used in their choice of a modernized financial management system; (2) the extent to which DHS managed the risks of using IBC for its TRIO project consistent with risk management best practices; and (3) the key factors and challenges that have impacted the TRIO project and DHS's plans for completing remaining key priorities. GAO interviewed key officials, reviewed relevant documents, and determined whether DHS followed best practices identified by GAO as necessary characteristics of a reliable, high-quality AOA process and other risk management best practices. The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) TRIO project represents a key effort to address long-standing financial management system deficiencies. During 2012 and 2013, the TRIO components—U.S. Coast Guard (Coast Guard), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO)—each completed an alternatives analysis (AA) to determine a preferred alternative for modernizing its financial management system. GAO found that DNDO's AA substantially met the four characteristics—well-documented, comprehensive, unbiased, and credible—that GAO previously identified for a reliable, high-quality analysis of alternatives (AOA) process. However, Coast Guard's and TSA's AAs did not fully or substantially meet three of these characteristics, and DHS guidance for conducting AAs did not substantially incorporate certain best practices, such as identifying significant risks and mitigation strategies and performing an independent review to help validate the AOA process. Based on these analyses and other factors, the TRIO components determined that migrating to a federal shared service provider (SSP) represented the best alternative, and in 2014, DHS selected the Department of the Interior's Interior Business Center (IBC) as the federal SSP for the project. However, because Coast Guard's and TSA's AAs did not fully or substantially reflect all of the characteristics noted above, they are at increased risk that the alternative selected may not achieve mission needs. DHS also did not fully follow best practices for managing project risks related to its use of IBC on the TRIO project. Specifically, DHS followed three of seven risk management best practices, such as determining risk sources and categories and establishing a risk management strategy. However, it did not fully follow four best practices for defining risk parameters, identifying risks, developing risk mitigation plans, and implementing these plans largely because its guidance did not sufficiently address these best practices. For example, although DHS created joint teams with IBC and provided additional resources to IBC to help address risk mitigation concerns, it did not always develop sufficiently detailed risk mitigation plans that also included contingency plans for selected critical risks. As a result, although IBC's capacity and experience for migrating large agencies the size of Coast Guard and TSA was identified as a risk in July 2014, a contingency plan working group to address this concern was not established until January 2017. By not fully following risk management best practices, DHS is at increased risk that potential problems may not be identified or properly mitigated. DHS, IBC, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and other federal oversight agencies identified various challenges that have impacted the TRIO project and contributed to a 2-year delay in the implementation of Coast Guard's and TSA's modernized solutions. These challenges include the lack of sufficient resources, aggressive schedule, complex requirements, increased costs, and project management and communication concerns. To help address these challenges, DHS and IBC established review teams and have taken other steps to assess potential mitigating steps. In May 2017, DHS determined that migrating the solution from IBC to a DHS data center represented the best option and initiated discovery efforts to further assess this as its path forward for the TRIO project.

{"pred": " \nThe federal government supports airport infrastructure development through three main ways: the Airport Improvement Program (AIP), the Passenger Facility Charge (PFC), and tax-exempt bonds. AIP provides grants to airports for planning and development, mainly for capital projects related to aircraft operations. PFCs are a state, local, or port authority fee that airports can impose on each paying passenger boarding an aircraft. Tax-exempt bonds allow airports to raise funds more cheaply than taxable bonds. The AIP program has undergone several changes since its inception, with the most recent reauthorization act funding the program at an annual level of $3.35 billion from FY2019 to FY2023. The program's funding structure is complex, with a combination of formula grants and discretionary funds. The federal government's role in airport development is to ensure a safe and efficient national airport system, with a focus on increasing capacity, reducing congestion, and minimizing noise impacts. The FAA estimates that the national system's capital needs for FY2019-FY2023 will total $35.1 billion, while the Airports Council International-North America (ACI-NA) estimates that the total infrastructure needs will be $128.1 billion over the same period. The ACI-NA estimate is higher due to its broader definition of airport projects, including those funded by PFCs, bonds, or state or local funding. The FAA's Operational Evolution Plan (OEP) aims to increase the capacity and efficiency of the National Airspace System (NAS) over a 10-year period. The OEP focuses on the 35 busiest airports, with the goal of increasing total capacity by 30% over a 10-year period. The FAA's Capacity Needs in the National Airspace System study identified 18 airports that would need additional capacity by 2020, with 14 hub airports likely to be capacity-constrained in 2025. The study also found that many non-OEP airports have higher capacities than originally presumed, and thus less need for additional capacity. The FAA's FACT3 study forecasted that airport delays would remain concentrated at a few major hub airports, and that the large runway projects required for capacity expansion would need to be funded in earlier years. The AIP program's structure and funding levels may need to be adjusted to accommodate the changing needs of the national airport system. The FAA's reauthorization act of 2018 included provisions to increase the flexibility of AIP funding, including the ability to use discretionary funds for capacity enhancement and the elimination of the requirement", "answers": ["There are five major sources of airport capital development funding: the federal Airport Improvement Program (AIP); local passenger facility charges (PFCs) imposed pursuant to federal law; tax-exempt bonds; state and local grants; and airport operating revenue from tenant lease and other revenue-generating activities such as landing fees. Federal involvement is most consequential in AIP, PFCs, and tax-exempt financing. The AIP has been providing federal grants for airport development and planning since the passage of the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 (P.L. 97-248). AIP funding is usually spent on projects that support aircraft operations such as runways, taxiways, aprons, noise abatement, land purchase, and safety or emergency equipment. The funds obligated for AIP are drawn from the airport and airway trust fund, which is supported by a variety of user fees and fuel taxes. Different airports use different combinations of these sources depending on the individual airport's financial situation and the type of project being considered. Although smaller airports' individual grants are of much smaller dollar amounts than the grants going to large and medium hub airports, the smaller airports are much more dependent on AIP to meet their capital needs. This is particularly the case for noncommercial airports, which received over 25% of AIP grants distributed in FY2018. Larger airports are much more likely to issue tax-exempt bonds or finance capital projects with the proceeds of PFCs. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-254) provided annual AIP funding of $3.35 billion from the airport and airway trust fund for five years from FY2019 to FY2023. The act left the basic structure of AIP unchanged, but authorized supplemental annual funding of over $1 billion from the general fund to the AIP discretionary funds, starting with $1.02 billion in FY2019, and required at least 50% of the additional discretionary funds to be available to nonhub and small hub airports. The act included a provision permitting eligible projects at small airports (including those in the State Block Grant Program) to receive a 95% federal share of project costs (otherwise capped at 90%), if such projects are determined to be successive phases of a multiphase construction project that received a grant in FY2011. The 2018 reauthorization expanded the number of states that could participate in the State Block Grant Program from 10 to 20 and also expanded the existing airport privatization pilot program (now renamed the Airport Investment Partnership Program) to include more than 10 airports. The law included a provision that forbids states or local governments from levying or collecting taxes on a business at an airport that \"is not generally imposed on sales or services by that State, political subdivision, or authority unless wholly utilized for airport or aeronautical purposes.\" The airport improvement issues Congress generally faces in the context of FAA reauthorization include the following: Should airport development funding be increased or decreased? Should the $4.50 ceiling on PFCs be eliminated, raised, or kept as it is? Could AIP be restructured to address congestion at the busiest U.S. airports, or should a large share of AIP resources continue to go to noncommercial airports that lack other sources of funding? Should Congress set tighter limits on the purposes for which AIP and PFC funds may be spent?

It also discusses some ongoing airport issues that are likely to be included in a future FAA reauthorization debate."], "length": 12362}

{"pred": " Passage 1\nThe Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) aimed to focus federal agencies on performance by requiring them to develop long-term and annual goals, and measure and report on progress towards those goals annually. Our analysis found that GPRA's requirements had laid a solid foundation for results-oriented management, but the benefit of collecting performance information is fully realized only when that information is actually used by managers to make decisions aimed at improving results. Despite some improvements, our surveys showed that managers' use of performance information generally has not changed or has declined. The GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA) expanded and enhanced the statutory framework for federal performance management, requiring certain agencies to designate a subset of their respective goals as their highest priorities and to measure and assess progress toward those goals at least quarterly. Our recent work and surveys suggest that data-driven reviews are having their intended effect, but the use of performance information in decision making remains a challenge. The President's Management Agenda (PMA) outlines a long-term vision for modernizing federal operations and improving the ability of agencies to achieve outcomes, but the administration's efforts to improve the use of performance information in decision making have been limited. Our analysis identified 14 agencies that may have insights into specific practices that led to recent improvements in managers' use of performance information, and 9 agencies where results suggest managers face challenges that have hampered their ability to use performance information. We recommended that OMB should work with the Performance Improvement Council (PIC) to identify and share among agencies proven practices for increasing, and challenges that hamper, the use of performance information in decision making more extensively within agencies. The Director of OMB should direct the leaders of the Leveraging Data as a Strategic Asset CAP Goal to ensure future updates to the action plan provide additional details on improving the use of data, including performance information, more extensively within federal agencies. The action plan should identify performance goals, contributing agencies, organizations, programs, and other activities, those responsible for leading implementation within these contributors, planned actions, time frames, and means to assess progress. The Director of OMB, in coordination with the PIC, should prioritize efforts to identify and share among agencies proven practices for increasing, and challenges that hamper, the use of performance information in decision making more extensively within agencies. At a minimum, this effort should involve the agencies that our survey suggests may offer such insights. The PIC has not yet undertaken a systematic approach to improve the use of performance information by managers at lower levels within agencies", "answers": ["To reform the federal government and make it more efficient and effective, agencies need to use data about program performance. The benefit of collecting performance information is only fully realized when it is used by managers to make decisions aimed at improving results. GAO was asked to review agencies' use of performance information. This report assesses, among other things, the extent to which: (1) 24 agencies' reported use of performance information and related leading practices has changed since 2013 and (2) the Executive Branch has taken actions to enhance the use of performance information. To address the first objective, GAO analyzed results from its 2017 survey of federal managers, and compared them to 2013 results. The survey covered a stratified random sample of 4,395 managers from the 24 Chief Financial Officers Act agencies. The survey had a 67 percent response rate and results can be generalized to the population of managers government-wide and at each agency. For the second objective, GAO reviewed agency documents and interviewed staff from OMB and the PIC. Agencies' reported use of performance information to make decisions, and leading practices that can promote such use, generally has not improved since GAO's last survey of federal managers in 2013. However, GAO's survey results continue to point to certain practices that could help agencies improve managers' use of performance information. For example, as shown in the table below, GAO's survey found that managers whose programs were subject to data-driven reviews (regular reviews used to assess progress on select agency goals) to a greater extent reported statistically significantly greater use of performance information to make decisions. The Executive Branch has begun taking steps to improve the use of performance information within agencies and across the government. For example, In the President's Management Agenda and government-wide reform plan, released in March and June 2018 respectively, the administration acknowledged the need to do more, and announced a goal, among other actions, to improve the use of data in federal decision making. However, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and others responsible for this goal have yet to fully develop action plans to hold agencies accountable for achieving it. The Performance Improvement Council (PIC), which is chaired by OMB, has undertaken efforts to improve the use of performance information by, for example, creating a working group on agency performance reviews. But it has not yet taken a systematic approach to identify and share proven practices that led to, or challenges that may be hampering, increased use of performance information by managers. GAO's survey results identified agencies that may have insights into such practices and challenges. More fully developing action plans for the new goal, and identifying and sharing proven practices and challenges, could help ensure the Executive Branch takes further steps to improve the use of performance information by managers within agencies and across the federal government. To improve the use of performance information within agencies and across the federal government, GAO recommends that OMB work with (1) fellow goal leaders to more fully develop action plans for the new goal to improve the use of data and (2) the PIC to prioritize efforts to identify and share proven practices and challenges. OMB had no comments on this report."], "length": 13750}

The eligibility criteria for the Purple Heart have changed over time, with the most recent expansion in 2015 allowing for the award to be given to servicemembers who are wounded or killed in terrorist attacks. The debate over Purple Heart eligibility has been contentious, with some arguing that mental health conditions such as PTSD should be eligible for the award, while others believe that it would dishonor those who have received Purple Hearts for physical injuries. The Department of Defense does not maintain a record of the number of Purple Heart recipients, but estimates suggest that over 1 million Purple Hearts have been awarded since 1932. The Purple Heart is currently authorized for any member of the U.S. Armed Forces who has been wounded or died from wounds sustained under certain conditions, including in action against an opposing armed force of a foreign country. The award may be given to servicemembers who are killed or wounded in terrorist attacks, as well as those who are prisoners of war or held captive by enemy forces. The Purple Heart may also be awarded to servicemembers who are wounded or killed in peacekeeping operations outside of the United States. The award is typically given to the servicemember, but may also be given to the representatives of the deceased. Servicemembers can be awarded multiple Purple Hearts for separate incidents, and the award is indicated with oak leaf clusters or 5/16 inch service stars. The decision to award the Purple Heart is typically made by the executive branch, but Congress has been expanding its role in this area in recent decades. The Purple Heart is a highly respected and prestigious award, and its eligibility criteria have been the subject of much debate and controversy. The award is currently being considered for expansion to include mental health conditions such as PTSD, but this proposal has been met with resistance from some veterans groups. The Purple Heart is a symbol of the sacrifices made by members of the U.S. Armed Forces, and its eligibility criteria should reflect the changing nature of warfare and the needs of servicemembers.

The conflicts 2001 to the present have greatly increased the number of Purple Hearts awarded to servicemembers. Events over the past few years have spurred debate on the eligibility criteria for the Purple Heart. Shootings on U.S. soil and medical conditions such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have prompted changes to the eligibility requirements for the Purple Heart. Some critics believe that these changes may lessen the value of the medal and the sacrifices of past recipients on the battlefield. In the past, efforts to modify the Purple Heart's eligibility requirements were contentious, and veterans groups were vocal concerning eligibility changes. While medal requirements are often left to the military and executive branch to decide, Congress is involved in Purple Heart eligibility, utilizing its constitutional power \"To Make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces\" (U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 8, clause 14). The Carl Levin and Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 (P.L. 113-291) included language that expands eligibility for the Purple Heart. Previous debates have raised several questions about the Purple Heart. In some respects, how an event is defined can determine eligibility: Is a servicemember the victim of a crime or a terrorist attack? Conversely, arguing that killed or wounded servicemembers \"should\" be eligible for the Purple Heart can redefine an event: Is the servicemember an advisor to a foreign military or a combatant? Are PTSD and other mental health conditions adequate injuries to warrant the Purple Heart? These are questions that Congress might consider if it chooses to act on this issue."], "length": 13502}

The reviews were not conducted in a timely manner, and in some cases, the required reviews were not conducted at all. The GAO found that VHA policy does not require documentation of all types of reviews, and VHA has not established a timeliness requirement for initiating reviews. The GAO also found that VHA's oversight of the reviews is inadequate, and network officials are not using the standardized audit tool as required. The GAO recommended that VHA require documentation of all reviews, establish a timeliness requirement, and strengthen its oversight. The VA concurred with the recommendations and plans to revise existing policy and update the standardized audit tool. The GAO also found that the VA medical centers did not report providers to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) and state licensing boards as required, which can facilitate providers who provide substandard care at one facility obtaining privileges at another VA medical center or at hospitals outside of VA's healthcare system. The GAO recommended that VHA require its networks to establish a process for overseeing VA medical centers to ensure they are reporting to the NPDB and state licensing boards and to ensure that this reporting is timely. The VA concurred with this recommendation and plans to include oversight of timely reporting to the NPDB and state licensing boards as part of the standard audit tool used by the networks. The GAO's findings highlight the need for improved oversight and accountability in the VA's healthcare system. The VA's concurrence with the GAO's recommendations suggests that the agency is taking steps to address these issues.

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (VAMC) officials are responsible for reviewing the clinical care delivered by their privileged providers—physicians and dentists who are approved to independently perform specific services—after concerns are raised. The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care. For example, GAO found that after one VAMC failed to report to the NPDB or SLBs a provider who resigned to avoid an adverse privileging action, a non-VA hospital in the same city took an adverse privileging action against that same provider for the same reason 2 years later."], "length": 13577}

This statement discusses Coast Guard actions needed to (1) improve the quality of data used for program management and (2) improve the transparency of its data for reporting on mission performance and planning. This statement is based on relevant products GAO issued from June 2014 through December 2017 on Coast Guard strategic planning and management issues, as well as related recommendation follow-up conducted through February 2018. GAO reviewed applicable laws, regulations, policies and guidance. GAO also interviewed Coast Guard officials responsible for administering these programs and obtained information on how they used data to inform decisionmaking. GAO interviewed a range of stakeholders, including federal and industry officials. GAO's prior work recommended multiple actions to improve the Coast Guard's program management by improving the quality of data it uses to manage and report on its mission performance. Specifically, GAO recommended actions such as collecting more complete data and clarifying the data limitations to facilitate more effective program management. For example, in December 2017, GAO found that more information is needed to calculate vessel safety statistics that could enhance the Coast Guard's knowledge about accident, injury, and fatality trends involving commercial fishing vessels. Having more complete information could be useful to carrying out its marine safety mission, and GAO recommended, among other things, that the Coast Guard ensure that data collected during commercial fishing vessel incident investigations is accurately captured. In 2018, the Coast Guard reported taking initial steps to capture more accurate data. GAO's prior work also identified areas where the Coast Guard could improve the transparency of the data it uses for reporting on its mission performance as well its capital planning purposes. For example, in an October 2017 report on performance goals, GAO found the Coast Guard's Annual Performance Report (APR) has not been released publicly since 2011. Consequently, there has not been full visibility over performance across all of the Coast Guard's missions. Coast Guard officials stated that a decision by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) leadership to limit the number of performance goals shared publicly had deterred the Coast Guard from public release of its APR. GAO recommended that APRs be available on the Coast Guard's website; the Coast Guard plans to publicly release future APRs. In addition, previous GAO reports found that the Coast Guard's annual 5-year capital investment plan, which projects acquisition funding needs for the upcoming 5 years, did not consistently reflect current total cost estimates or the effects of tradeoffs made as part of the annual budget cycle. GAO made recommendations to help the Coast Guard plan for future acquisitions and the difficult trade off decisions it will face given funding constraints. The Coast Guard agreed, but it is unclear when it will complete the 20-year plan.

Changes in the market for counterfeit goods entering the United States pose new challenges for consumers, the private sector, and U.S. agencies that enforce intellectual property rights (IPR). Specifically, growth in e-commerce has contributed to a shift in the sale of counterfeit goods in the United States, with consumers increasingly purchasing goods online and counterfeiters producing a wider variety of goods that may be sold on websites alongside authentic products. For example, 20 of 47 items GAO purchased from third-party sellers on popular consumer websites were counterfeit, according to testing by the products' rights holders (see table), highlighting potential risks to consumers. The changes in the market for counterfeit goods can also pose challenges to the private sector—for example, the challenge of distinguishing counterfeit from authentic goods listed for sale online—and complicate the enforcement efforts of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). CBP and ICE engage in a number of activities to enhance IPR enforcement; however, while ICE has assessed some of its efforts, CBP has taken limited steps to do so. CBP's and ICE's IPR enforcement activities broadly include detecting imports of potentially IPR-infringing goods, conducting special operations at U.S. ports, engaging with international partners, and undertaking localized pilot programs or port-led initiatives. CBP and ICE have collected some performance data for each of the eight activities GAO reviewed, and ICE has taken some steps to understand the impact of its efforts. However, CBP has conducted limited evaluation of its efforts to enhance IPR enforcement. Consequently, CBP may lack information needed to ensure it is investing its resources in the most efficient and effective activities. CBP and ICE generally collaborate on IPR enforcement, but according to private sector representatives, restrictions on CBP's information sharing limit private sector enforcement efforts. GAO found that CBP and ICE have undertaken efforts that align with selected key practices for interagency collaboration, such as participating in developing a national IPR enforcement strategy and agreeing on roles and responsibilities. However, sharing additional information about seized items with rights-holding companies and e-commerce websites could improve enforcement, according to private sector representatives. CBP officials said they share information to the extent allowed under current regulations, but CBP has not completed an assessment of what, if any, additional information would be beneficial to share with private sector entities.

{"pred": " \nPassage 2 discusses the oversight of clinical care reviews at five VA medical centers. The review found that the medical centers lacked documentation for almost half of the reviews conducted, and in some cases, the required reviews were not conducted at all. The main argument is that VHA policy does not require documentation of all types of reviews, and VHA's oversight of the reviews is inadequate. The key evidence presented includes the lack of documentation for 26 providers who underwent focused professional practice evaluations (FPPEs) for cause, and the failure to report nine providers to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) and state licensing boards as required. The review also found that VHA's oversight of the reviews is inadequate, with network officials unaware of situations in which VA medical center officials failed to report providers to the NPDB. The unique point made is that VHA's failure to report providers to the NPDB and state licensing boards facilitates providers who provide substandard care at one facility obtaining privileges at another VA medical center or at hospitals outside of VA's health care system. The review recommends that VHA require documentation of all reviews, establish a timeliness requirement for initiating reviews, and strengthen its oversight by requiring networks to oversee VA medical centers to ensure that such reviews are documented and initiated in a timely manner. VA concurred with these recommendations and described plans for VHA to revise existing policy and update the standardized audit tool used by the networks.  The review also found that VHA lacks reasonable assurance that all providers who should be reported to these entities are reported, and that VHA's failure to report providers to the NPDB and state licensing boards facilitates providers who provide substandard care at one facility obtaining privileges at another VA medical center or at hospitals outside of VA's health care system.  The review concludes that VHA needs to improve its oversight of clinical care reviews to ensure that providers who provide substandard care are held accountable.  The review also found that VHA's failure to report providers to the NPDB and state licensing boards is a significant concern, as it allows providers who provide substandard care to continue practicing without being held accountable.  The review recommends that VHA take steps to improve its oversight of clinical care reviews and to ensure that providers who provide substandard care are held accountable.

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (VAMC) officials are responsible for reviewing the clinical care delivered by their privileged providers—physicians and dentists who are approved to independently perform specific services—after concerns are raised. The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care. For example, GAO found that after one VAMC failed to report to the NPDB or SLBs a provider who resigned to avoid an adverse privileging action, a non-VA hospital in the same city took an adverse privileging action against that same provider for the same reason 2 years later."], "length": 13809}

They estimated that incorporating touch screen technology would cost around 17.50 Euros per remote, which is above their target price of 12.50 Euros. They decided to omit the touch screen in favor of voice recognition, considering it a lower-risk option that would allow them to have a product on the market sooner. The group also discussed the design of the remote control, considering a non-remote-looking design with a rounded shape and a squishy feel, which would be a unique feature. They decided to stick with a traditional button layout, using rubber buttons, and to incorporate a voice recognition system and a drop-down menu. The group also discussed the casing, considering different materials such as wood, leather, and rubber, and decided to use a rubber-like material for the outside case. They also discussed the possibility of having different case colors and designs for different people. The group assigned tasks to each member, with Nathan working on the basic look and feel of the remote control, Ron working on the layout of the design with the voice recognition and drop-down menu, and the team working together to create a prototype using prototype building materials. The next meeting was scheduled for half an hour, and the group agreed to work on multiple case colors and stick with the same basic non-remote design.  The group also discussed the availability of disposal bins for unused prescription drugs and the factors that affect participation rates among pharmacies and other eligible entities. They found that the costs associated with purchasing, installing, and managing the disposal bins are a major factor in the low participation rates, with stakeholders estimating the yearly costs of maintaining a disposal bin to range from $500 to $600 per location. They also found that uncertainty over proper implementation and participation in other, similar efforts for disposing of unused prescription drugs are also factors that affect participation rates. The group discussed the DEA's regulations for prescription drug disposal bins and the challenges that authorized collectors face in complying with these regulations. They found that the DEA's non-retrievable standard for destruction of the inner liners of the bins is a major challenge, with stakeholders expressing uncertainty over whether certain disposal methods meet this standard. The group also discussed the availability of disposal options at law enforcement agencies and how this contributes to the low participation rates among pharmacies as authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs.

The report also discusses the methodology used by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to estimate the maximum probable loss (MPL) for a launch or reentry accident. The report concludes that the FAA's MPL methodology has several weaknesses, including an outdated cost-of-casualty amount and a lack of guidance on determining which methodological tools to use for a given launch. The report recommends that the FAA reevaluate its MPL methodology and update the cost-of-casualty amount. The report also recommends that the FAA establish an estimated completion date for developing and implementing a plan to establish guidance on the most appropriate MPL methodologies and tools to use for each launch.

{"pred": " \nThe National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NRC) and other federal agencies have established guidelines for radiation exposure, including the linear no-threshold model, which assumes that the risk of cancer increases with every incremental increase in radiation exposure. The NRC has set dose limits for radiation exposure that are below the level considered low dose by the National Academies, and has applied the principle that doses should be kept as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA). However, the effects of low-dose radiation are more difficult to detect, and there is uncertainty about the extent to which the health effects for non-U.S. populations can be extrapolated to a U.S. population that is regularly exposed to low-dose radiation. The federal agencies have collectively decreased their annual funding obligations for research on the health effects of low-dose radiation by 48 percent from 2012 to 2016, with DOE accounting for a large portion of this decrease. The GAO recommends that the Secretary of Energy lead the development of a mechanism for interagency collaboration to determine roles and responsibilities for addressing priorities related to research on the health effects of low-dose radiation. The GAO believes that an interagency coordination mechanism is needed and that DOE is in the best position to lead agencies in developing the most appropriate mechanism.  The GAO made several changes to their report and recommendation to clarify DOE’s role and to address DOE’s concerns.  The GAO continues to believe that an interagency coordination mechanism for low-dose research is needed.", "answers": ["This testimony summarizes the information contained in GAO's September 2017 report, entitled Low-Dose Radiation: Interagency Collaboration on Planning Research Could Improve Information on Health Effects ( GAO-17-546 ). The Department of Energy (DOE), Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Food and Drug Administration generally used the advice of scientific advisory bodies to develop and apply radiation protection requirements and guidance for workers and the public in the radiation exposure settings that GAO reviewed. These settings were: (1) the operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants; (2) the cleanup of sites with radiological contamination; (3) the use of medical equipment that produces radiation; and (4) accidental or terrorism-related exposure to radiation. Specifically, the agencies relied on the advice of three scientific advisory bodies that supported the use of a model that assumes the risk of cancer increases with every incremental radiation exposure. Accordingly, the agencies have set regulatory dose limits and issued guidance to confine exposure to levels that reduce the risk of cancer, while recognizing that scientific uncertainties occur in estimating cancer risks from low-dose radiation. For example, NRC requires nuclear power plants to consider measures for limiting workers' exposure below NRC's regulatory dose limit, such as by using robots for maintenance work in radiation areas. GAO identified seven federal agencies that funded research on low-dose radiation's health effects. In fiscal years 2012 to 2016, DOE, NRC, EPA, and four other federal agencies obligated about $210 million for such research . Although the agencies have collaborated on individual projects on radiation's health effects, they have not established a collaborative mechanism to set research priorities. GAO's previous work has shown that federal agencies can use such mechanisms to implement interagency collaboration to develop and coordinate sound science policies. In the past, DOE took a leading role in this area because DOE provided stable funding and advocated for greater coordination on research on low-dose radiation's health effects. However, since fiscal year 2012, DOE has phased out funding for one of its main research programs in this area. This has created a void in coordination efforts among federal agencies, and no other agency has stepped forward to fill this void. Because of DOE's prior experience as a leader in this area of research and its research responsibility under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, it could play an important role in helping federal agencies establish a coordinating mechanism for low-dose radiation research.

The main argument is that the exercise of emergency powers has become increasingly rooted in statutory law, with the discretion available to the executive being harnessed and regulated procedurally through the National Emergencies Act. The passage highlights the importance of understanding the concept of a national emergency, which is defined as an unforeseen combination of circumstances that calls for immediate action. The key evidence presented includes the history of emergency powers, from the Lincoln Administration to the present day, and the development of the National Emergencies Act in 1976. The passage also notes that the National Emergencies Act has not been revisited by congressional overseers since its enactment. A unique point made in the passage is the anomaly that occurred in 2005, when President George W. Bush issued a proclamation suspending certain wage requirements without declaring a national emergency, highlighting the need for clear procedures and regulations for the exercise of emergency powers.

This shift has made it more difficult for consumers to identify counterfeit goods, as counterfeiters have adopted new ways to deceive consumers, such as posting pictures of authentic goods on their websites and posting pseudonymous reviews. The volume, variety, and methods of shipment of counterfeit goods have also changed, with express carriers and international mail becoming the predominant form of transportation for IPR-infringing goods entering the United States. The risks associated with counterfeit goods extend beyond the infringement of a company's IPR, as counterfeit products may contain hazardous substances, such as lead and cyanide. The report recommends that CBP take steps to evaluate the effectiveness of its IPR enforcement efforts and that CBP and ICE assess what additional information would be beneficial to share with the private sector to enhance IPR enforcement.

The CCM does not prohibit cluster munitions that can detect and engage a single target or explosive submunitions equipped with an electronic self-destruction or self-deactivating feature. The United States has not signed the CCM, but has implemented a policy that requires cluster munitions to leave less than 1% of unexploded submunitions on the battlefield. The policy was revised in 2017 to allow for the use of cluster munitions that do not meet the 1% standard in extreme situations. The Department of Defense (DOD) will continue to replace cluster munitions that do not meet the standard with new munitions that meet the 1% or less unexploded submunitions standard.

The passage reports that USAID has obligated more than $5 billion in bilateral assistance to the Palestinians since 1993, primarily using funds appropriated through the Economic Support Fund (ESF). The assistance aims to build a more democratic, stable, prosperous, and secure Palestinian society. The passage also examines the vetting process of Palestinian Authority (PA) creditors to ensure that assistance does not support entities or individuals associated with terrorism. The report finds that USAID has complied with the vetting requirements and has taken additional steps to mitigate findings noted in external assessments of the PA Ministries of Health and Finance and Planning. The passage concludes that USAID's debt relief payments to PA creditors have been made in accordance with USAID policies and procedures, and that the agency has taken steps to ensure the integrity of its debt relief payment process. The report also notes that USAID has commissioned external assessments and financial audits of the PA Ministries of Health and Finance and Planning to ensure that assistance is used as intended.

According to the Department of State, this assistance to the Palestinians promotes U.S. economic and political foreign policy interests by supporting Middle East peace negotiations and financing economic stabilization programs. USAID is primarily responsible for administering ESF assistance to the West Bank and Gaza. Appropriations acts for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 included provisions for GAO to review the treatment, handling, and uses of funds provided through the ESF for assistance to the West Bank and Gaza. This report examines (1) the status of ESF assistance and projects provided to the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016, including project assistance and payments to PA creditors, and (2) the extent to which USAID conducted required vetting of PA creditors to ensure that this assistance would not support entities or individuals associated with terrorism and assessed PA ministries' capacity to use ESF assistance as intended. GAO reviewed relevant laws and regulations and USAID financial data, policies, procedures, and documents. GAO also interviewed USAID and State Department officials. As of March 2018, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) had allocated about $545 million of funding appropriated to the Economic Support Fund (ESF) for assistance in the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016. USAID obligated about $544 million (over 99 percent) and expended about $351 million (over 64 percent) of the total allocations. Project assistance accounted for approximately $399 million of the obligated funds, while payments to Palestinian Authority (PA) creditors accounted for $145 million (see figure). USAID's obligations for project assistance in the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 supported three development objectives—Economic Growth and Infrastructure ($239 million), Investing in the Next Generation ($107 million), and Governance and Civic Engagement (about $25 million). In fiscal years 2015 and 2016, USAID made payments directly to PA creditors—two Israeli fuel companies, to cover debts for petroleum purchases, and a local Palestinian bank, to pay off a line of credit used for PA medical referrals to six hospitals in the East Jerusalem Hospital network. USAID vetted PA creditors to ensure that the program assistance would not provide support to entities or individuals associated with terrorism and also conducted external assessments and financial audits of PA ministries of Health and Finance and Planning. USAID documentation showed that, as required, officials checked the vetting status of each PA creditor within 12 months before USAID signed its debt relief grant agreements with the PA. In addition, although USAID determined that it was not legally required to assess the PA Ministry of Health's medical referral services and the Ministry of Finance and Planning's petroleum procurement system, the agency commissioned external assessments of both ministries. These assessments found some weaknesses in both ministries' systems; however, USAID mission officials stated that these weaknesses did not affect USAID debt relief payments to the PA creditors. Nevertheless, USAID took additional steps to mitigate the identified weaknesses. For example, a USAID contractor worked with the Ministry of Health to update, revise, and approve guidelines for medical referrals. In addition, USAID commissioned financial audits of the debt relief grant agreements between USAID and the PA for direct payments to PA creditors in fiscal year 2015 and 2016.

{"pred": " Passage 2\nThe US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) faces challenges in aligning its services and real property portfolio to meet the needs of veterans. The VA has a large inventory of vacant or underutilized buildings, many of which are historic and difficult to renovate or demolish. The VA's Strategic Capital Investment Planning (SCIP) process has limitations, including subjective narratives, long timeframes, and restricted access to information, which undermine its ability to achieve its goals. The VAIP process, which produces a market-level health services delivery plan for each Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) and a facility master plan for each medical facility, assumes all future growth in services will be provided directly through VA facilities, which is not accurate. The VA has discontinued its VAIP facility master plans while pursuing a national realignment strategy. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommends that the VA address identified limitations to the SCIP process and assess the value of the VAIP's facility master plans as a facility-planning tool. The GAO also suggests that the VA consider seven elements used by the Department of Defense (DOD) in its BRAC process, including establishing goals, criteria for evaluating closures and realignments, estimating costs and savings, establishing an organizational structure, developing a common analytical framework, developing BRAC oversight mechanisms, and involving the audit community. The GAO identifies two key challenges that affected DOD's implementation of BRAC 2005 and would need to be addressed for VA to adopt a BRAC-like process for its asset and infrastructure review. These challenges include the need for sustained senior leadership attention and a high level of coordination among many stakeholders to complete by the required date, and the large number and variety of BRAC actions, which complicated the implementation process. The GAO concludes that the VA needs to address these challenges and implement a BRAC-like process to effectively align its services and real property portfolio to meet the needs of veterans. The GAO also suggests that Congress consider seven elements used by DOD in its BRAC process when evaluating proposed legislation for disposing of or realigning VA property. The GAO's recommendations aim to improve the VA's ability to align its services and real property portfolio, reduce costs, and improve the quality of care for veterans. The GAO's report provides a comprehensive analysis of the VA's challenges and recommends a BRAC-like process to address these challenges and improve the VA's ability to meet the needs of veterans.

DOD has repeatedly applied the BRAC process to reduce the amount of unneeded property that it owns and leases and to save billions of dollars that could be applied to higher priority defense needs. This statement is based on GAO's April 2017 report related to VA facility alignment ( GAO-17-349 ) and numerous GAO reports related to the BRAC process as summarized in a June 2011 testimony ( GAO-11-704T ) and a March 2012 testimony ( GAO-12-513T ). This statement addresses (1) the factors that affect VA's facility alignment and the extent to which VA's capital-planning process facilitates the alignment of facilities with the veterans' population, and (2) the key elements and challenges affecting DOD and the Commission in BRAC 2005. Detailed information on our scope and methodologies for this work can be found in these published products, cited throughout this testimony. Geographic shifts in the veterans' population, changes in health care delivery, aging infrastructure, and limited stakeholder involvement affect the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) efforts to align its services and real property portfolio to meet the needs of veterans. For example, a shift over time from inpatient to outpatient care will likely result in underutilized space once used for inpatient care. Further, the historic status of some VA facilities adds to the complexity of converting or disposing of them. In such instances, it is often difficult and costly for VA to modernize, renovate, and retrofit these older facilities. GAO reported that two of the planning processes VA uses to align its facilities—VA's Strategic Capital Investment Planning (SCIP) and the VA Integrated Planning (VAIP)—have limitations that undermine VA's efforts to achieve its goals. Specifically: VA relies on the SCIP process to plan and prioritize capital projects, but VA routinely asks its facility planners to submit their next year's planned project narratives before knowing if their previous submissions have been funded. The overlapping budget cycle, which is outside of VA's control, combined with other SCIP limitations—including subjective narratives, long time frames, and restricted access to information—make it difficult for VA to rely on SCIP to accurately identify the capital necessary to address its service and infrastructure gaps. VA concurred that it needs to address SCIP limitations that are within its control, as GAO recommended; VA has made some progress in implementing the recommendation has made some progress in implementing the recommendation.\\ The VAIP process is estimated to cost $108 million and to produce market-level service delivery plans and facility master plans. However, the VAIP master plans incorrectly assume that all future growth in services will be provided directly through VA facilities without considering alternatives, such as purchasing care from the community. GAO recommended that VA consider discontinuing the VAIP facility master plans pending an assessment of their value as a facility-planning tool. VA agreed with the recommendation and is implementing it while pursuing a national realignment strategy.. Key elements of the Department of Defense's (DOD) 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process could benefit VA's asset and infrastructure review. The key elements included: (1) establishing goals for the process, (2) developing criteria for evaluating closures and realignments, and (3) establishing an organizational structure to develop closure and realignment options. GAO identified key challenges that affected DOD's implementation of BRAC 2005 and the results achieved; these challenges would need to be addressed if VA is to successfully apply the process. These challenges included: (1) large, complex recommendations required sustained senior leadership's attention and a high level of coordination among many stakeholders, and (2) the large number of actions that depend on each other for successful implementation.

Elections are primarily administered by thousands of state and local systems rather than a single, unified national system. States and localities share responsibility for most election administration duties. Exactly how responsibilities are assigned at the state and local levels varies both between and within states, but there are some general patterns in the distribution of duties. States typically have primary responsibility for making decisions about the rules of elections (policymaking). Localities typically have primary responsibility for conducting elections in accordance with those rules (implementation). Localities, with varying contributions from states, typically also have primary responsibility for paying for the activities and resources required to conduct elections (funding). The structures of the state and local systems that conduct elections also vary between and within states. Common variations include differences related to the leadership of the system, the relationship between local election officials and the state, and the population size and density of the jurisdiction the system serves. The leadership of a state or local election system may be elected or appointed, and both the leaders and the methods used to select them may be partisan, bipartisan, or nonpartisan. State officials may have more or less direct influence over local election officials, and the extent of their influence may be affected by other structural features of the state's election systems, such as the methods used to select local officials. Finally, larger election jurisdictions have different administrative advantages and challenges than smaller ones, and more urban jurisdictions have different advantages and challenges than more rural ones. These differences between jurisdictions may be reflected in structural features of the election systems that serve them, such as how the systems allocate resources and where they find specialized expertise. Understanding the duties and structures of state and local election systems may be relevant to Congress for at least two reasons. First, the way state and local election systems work can affect how well federal action on election administration serves its intended purposes. The effectiveness of federal action depends in part on how it is implemented. How it is implemented can depend, in turn, on how the state and local election systems that implement it work. Second, Congress can make or incentivize changes to the way state and local election systems work. Congress has a number of policy tools it can use to affect the administration of federal elections.

Frasier's brother, Niles, suggests that the dream may be a manifestation of Frasier's unconscious mind, and that the tattoo could be a symbol of his mother. However, Frasier's father, Martin, reveals that he may have called his mother \"Hesty\" once, which could be the source of the tattoo. Frasier is relieved to have solved the mystery of his dream, but it is revealed that he is still having the same dream, and that he may be using the dream as a way to avoid dealing with his own desires and anxieties. The passage explores the themes of dreams, the unconscious mind, and the complexities of human psychology. The key evidence presented includes Frasier's recurring dream, his conversations with Niles and Martin, and his own reflections on the meaning of the dream. The passage is a humorous and satirical take on the world of psychiatry and the human psyche.

WMATA operates six rail lines and has 118 linear miles of guideway. The authority's capital investments are funded through grants from the federal government, matching funds from states and local jurisdictions, and long-term debt. From fiscal years 2011 through 2017, WMATA received about $5.8 billion in capital funding, with the federal government providing about 55% of the funding. WMATA has a capital planning process that includes developing a Capital Needs Inventory, annual capital budget, and Six-Year Capital Improvement Program. However, the authority has not established documented policies and procedures for its capital planning process, which has led to inconsistent and inefficient capital investment decisions. WMATA has also not developed performance measures to assess capital projects and the capital planning process. The authority has made progress in reducing track defects and electrical fires, but still faces challenges in implementing its track preventive maintenance program. WMATA officials have identified several challenges, including securing sufficient track time, demonstrating work time productivity, and overcoming resource constraints. The authority has not conducted a comprehensive risk assessment of the track preventive maintenance program, which is necessary to ensure the program's long-term viability. WMATA has not prepared a formal program management plan for the track preventive maintenance program, which is also necessary to ensure the program's success. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has made five recommendations to WMATA to address these issues, including establishing documented policies and procedures for the capital planning process, developing performance measures, and conducting a comprehensive risk assessment of the track preventive maintenance program. WMATA has partially concurred with these recommendations, but has not fully implemented them. The GAO will continue to monitor WMATA's progress in addressing these issues.

This report examines: (1) how WMATA spent its capital funds from fiscal years 2011 through 2017, (2) how WMATA's new capital planning process addresses weaknesses it identified in the prior process, and (3) WMATA's progress toward its track preventive maintenance program's goals and how the program aligns with leading program management practices. GAO analyzed WMATA's financial and program information, interviewed officials of WMATA, the Federal Transit Administration, and five transit agencies selected for similarities to WMATA. GAO compared WMATA's capital planning process and track maintenance program with leading practices. From fiscal years 2011 through 2017, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) spent almost $6 billion on a variety of capital assets, with the largest share spent on improving its rail and bus fleet (see figure). Over this period, WMATA's capital spending was, on average, about $845 million annually. WMATA's new capital planning process could address some weaknesses it identified in the prior process. WMATA established a framework for quantitatively prioritizing capital needs (investments to a group of related assets) over a 10-year period. However, WMATA has not established documented policies and procedures for implementing the new process, such as those for selecting specific projects for funding in its annual capital budget. WMATA is currently using its new capital planning process to make fiscal year 2020 investment decisions. WMATA has proposed a fiscal year 2020 capital budget of $1.4 billion. Without documented policies and procedures for implementing the new planning process, WMATA's stakeholders do not have reasonable assurance that WMATA is following a sound process for making investment decisions. WMATA has made significant progress toward its track preventive maintenance program's goals, which are to reduce both track-defect and electrical-fire incidents by 50 percent in fiscal year 2019 compared with 2017. In fiscal year 2018, WMATA met its goal for reducing track defect incidents and reduced electrical fire incidents by 20 percent. However, in designing the program, WMATA did not fully assess risks. For example, WMATA did not quantitatively assess the impact of track defects or electrical fires on its ability to provide service, nor did it consider other risks such as non-electrical track fires, which represent about 30 percent of all fires on the system, or other factors, such as resources or track time. Without a comprehensive risk assessment, WMATA lacks reasonable assurance that the program is designed to address risks affecting the safety of the rail system or other risks that could hinder the new program's success.

This shift has made it more difficult for law enforcement to identify and seize counterfeit goods, as they are often hidden among legitimate products. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have reported an increase in the volume and variety of counterfeit goods seized, with many of these goods being shipped from China and Hong Kong. The CBP has also noted that the methods of importing counterfeit goods have changed, with express carriers and international mail becoming the predominant form of transportation. A test purchase of consumer products from online marketplaces found that 20 out of 47 items were counterfeit, highlighting the difficulty in identifying counterfeit goods online. The CBP and ICE have taken steps to enhance IPR enforcement, but the CBP has limited evaluation of its efforts, and the agencies have identified challenges in sharing information with the private sector to protect intellectual property rights. Overall, the rise of e-commerce has created new challenges for law enforcement and intellectual property rights holders in identifying and preventing the sale of counterfeit goods.

Changes in the market for counterfeit goods entering the United States pose new challenges for consumers, the private sector, and U.S. agencies that enforce intellectual property rights (IPR). Specifically, growth in e-commerce has contributed to a shift in the sale of counterfeit goods in the United States, with consumers increasingly purchasing goods online and counterfeiters producing a wider variety of goods that may be sold on websites alongside authentic products. For example, 20 of 47 items GAO purchased from third-party sellers on popular consumer websites were counterfeit, according to testing by the products' rights holders (see table), highlighting potential risks to consumers. The changes in the market for counterfeit goods can also pose challenges to the private sector—for example, the challenge of distinguishing counterfeit from authentic goods listed for sale online—and complicate the enforcement efforts of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). CBP and ICE engage in a number of activities to enhance IPR enforcement; however, while ICE has assessed some of its efforts, CBP has taken limited steps to do so. CBP's and ICE's IPR enforcement activities broadly include detecting imports of potentially IPR-infringing goods, conducting special operations at U.S. ports, engaging with international partners, and undertaking localized pilot programs or port-led initiatives. CBP and ICE have collected some performance data for each of the eight activities GAO reviewed, and ICE has taken some steps to understand the impact of its efforts. However, CBP has conducted limited evaluation of its efforts to enhance IPR enforcement. Consequently, CBP may lack information needed to ensure it is investing its resources in the most efficient and effective activities. CBP and ICE generally collaborate on IPR enforcement, but according to private sector representatives, restrictions on CBP's information sharing limit private sector enforcement efforts. GAO found that CBP and ICE have undertaken efforts that align with selected key practices for interagency collaboration, such as participating in developing a national IPR enforcement strategy and agreeing on roles and responsibilities. However, sharing additional information about seized items with rights-holding companies and e-commerce websites could improve enforcement, according to private sector representatives. CBP officials said they share information to the extent allowed under current regulations, but CBP has not completed an assessment of what, if any, additional information would be beneficial to share with private sector entities.

The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs.

GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care.

The FHA was created in 1934 to encourage lending for housing and stimulate the construction industry. It has since become a key player in the mortgage market, providing affordable mortgages to households who might not be well-served by the private market. The FHA insures mortgages with lower down payment requirements and less stringent credit history requirements than conventional loans. This makes FHA-insured mortgages attractive to first-time homebuyers, low- and moderate-income households, and minorities. However, some have questioned whether FHA-insured mortgages are similar to subprime mortgages, which were a major contributor to the 2008 financial crisis. The FHA has taken steps to strengthen its insurance fund, including increasing mortgage insurance premiums and strengthening underwriting requirements. The number of new mortgages insured by FHA has fluctuated over the years, but it remains a significant player in the mortgage market. In 2018, FHA insured over 1 million new single-family purchase and refinance mortgages, with an initial loan balance of $209 billion. The FHA's market share has decreased somewhat from its peak during the housing market turmoil, but it generally remains higher than it was in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The FHA's market share can be measured in different ways, and it tends to fluctuate in response to economic conditions and other factors. The appropriate market share for FHA has been a subject of ongoing debate among policymakers. The FHA's financial status is also a concern, as it has historically generated negative credit subsidy, meaning that it has not required appropriations to cover the expected costs of loans to be insured.

FHA insures private lenders against the possibility of borrowers defaulting on mortgages that meet certain criteria, thereby expanding the availability of mortgage credit beyond what may be available otherwise. If the borrower defaults on the mortgage, FHA is to repay the lender the remaining amount owed. A household that obtains an FHA-insured mortgage must meet FHA's eligibility and underwriting standards, including showing that it has sufficient income to repay a mortgage. FHA requires a minimum down payment of 3.5% from most borrowers, which is lower than the down payment required for many other types of mortgages. FHA-insured mortgages cannot exceed a statutory maximum mortgage amount, which varies by area and is based on area median house prices but cannot exceed a specified ceiling in high-cost areas. (The ceiling is set at $726,525 in high-cost areas in calendar year 2019.) Borrowers are charged fees, called mortgage insurance premiums, in exchange for the insurance. In FY2018, FHA insured over 1 million new mortgages (including both home purchase and refinance mortgages) with a combined principal balance of $209 billion. FHA's share of the mortgage market tends to vary with economic conditions and other factors. In the aftermath of the housing market turmoil that began around 2007 and a related contraction of mortgage lending, FHA insured a larger share of mortgages than it had in the preceding years.

Since that time, FHA's share of the mortgage market has decreased somewhat, though it remains higher than it was in the early 2000s. In calendar year 2017, FHA's overall share of the mortgage market was about 17%. FHA-insured mortgages, like all mortgages, experienced increased default rates during the housing downturn that began around 2007, leading to concerns about the stability of the FHA insurance fund for single-family mortgages, the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMI Fund).

This review analyzes (1) the reliability of TAP data on participation levels for Coast Guard servicemembers and the factors that affect participation, and (2) the Coast Guard's performance measures and monitoring efforts related to TAP. GAO interviewed Coast Guard headquarters staff; surveyed 12 Coast Guard installations that conduct TAP (100 percent response rate); collected and reviewed participation data for reliability; and interviewed TAP managers from three installations selected for size and location, and 25 Coast Guard servicemembers at one location. (For a companion report on TAP implementation for separating and retiring servicemembers in other military services, see GAO-18-23 .) The United States Coast Guard (Coast Guard), which is overseen by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), lacks complete or reliable data on participation in the Transition Assistance Program (TAP), designed to assist servicemembers returning to civilian life. According to senior Coast Guard officials, a major reason why data are not reliable is the lack of an up-to-date Commandant Instruction that specifies when to record TAP participation data. Consequently, the data are updated on an ad-hoc basis and may not be timely or complete, according to officials. Federal internal control standards call for management to use quality information to achieve the entity's objectives. Until the Coast Guard issues an up-to-date Commandant Instruction that establishes policies and procedures to improve the reliability and completeness of TAP data, it will lack quality information to gauge the extent to which it is meeting TAP participation requirements in the VOW to Hire Heroes Act of 2011. According to GAO's survey of Coast Guard installations, various factors affected participation, such as servicemembers serving at geographically remote locations or separating from the Coast Guard rapidly. TAP officials and Coast Guard servicemembers GAO interviewed said commanders and direct supervisors sometimes pulled servicemembers out of TAP class or postponed participation because of mission priorities. TAP managers also said they rely on delivering TAP online because many Coast Guard servicemembers are stationed remotely. The Coast Guard cannot effectively measure performance to ensure key TAP requirements are met because it lacks reliable data and does not monitor compliance with several TAP requirements. Further, the Coast Guard has not established a formal performance goal against which it can measure progress, although federal internal control standards stipulate that management should consider external requirements—such as the laws with which the entity is required to comply—to clearly define objectives in specific and measurable terms. Establishing a goal could help the Coast Guard define expected performance. In addition, the Coast Guard does not monitor TAP requirements regarding the timeliness of servicemembers' TAP participation or their access to additional 2-day classes. Consequently, it cannot know whether servicemembers are starting TAP early enough to complete the program or those who elected to attend additional 2-day classes were able to do so before separation or retirement, as required by the Act. Finally, the Coast Guard lacks an up-to-date Commandant Instruction that establishes the roles and responsibilities of Coast Guard staff in implementing TAP. Federal internal control standards stipulate that management should assign responsibility and delegate authority to key roles throughout the entity. Issuing an up-to-date Commandant Instruction that defines roles and responsibilities would clarify who is ultimately responsible for ensuring Coast Guard servicemembers attend TAP, thereby facilitating accountability. GAO is making seven recommendations, including that the Coast Guard issue a new Commandant Instruction establishing data collection policies, set TAP performance goals, monitor timeliness and access, and define roles and responsibilities. DHS agreed with all of GAO's recommendations."], "length": 13594}

Rules for giving certain types of names to certain types of Navy ships have evolved over time. There have been exceptions to the Navy's ship-naming rules, particularly for the purpose of naming a ship for a person when the rule for that type of ship would have called for it to be named for something else. Some observers have perceived a breakdown in, or corruption of, the rules for naming Navy ships. On July 13, 2012, the Navy submitted to Congress a 73-page report on the Navy's policies and practices for naming ships. For ship types now being procured for the Navy, or recently procured for the Navy, naming rules can be summarized as follows: The first Ohio replacement ballistic missile submarine (SSBN-826) has been named Columbia in honor of the District of Columbia, but the Navy has not stated what the naming rule for these ships will be. Virginia (SSN-774) class attack submarines are being named for states. Aircraft carriers are generally named for past U.S. Presidents. Of the past 14, 10 were named for past U.S. Presidents, and 2 for Members of Congress. Destroyers are being named for deceased members of the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, including Secretaries of the Navy. The Navy has not yet announced a naming rule for its planned new class of FFG(X) frigates, the first of which the Navy wants to procure in FY2021. Previous classes of U.S. Navy frigates, like Navy destroyers, were generally named for naval leaders and heroes. Littoral Combat Ships (LCSs) are being named for regionally important U.S. cities and communities. Amphibious assault ships are being named for important battles in which U.S. Marines played a prominent part, and for famous earlier U.S. Navy ships that were not named for battles. San Antonio (LPD-17) class amphibious ships are being named for major U.S. cities and communities, and cities and communities attacked on September 11, 2001. John Lewis (TAO-205) class oilers are being named for people who fought for civil rights and human rights. Expeditionary Fast Transports (EPFs) are being named for small U.S. cities. Expeditionary Transport Docks (ESDs) and Expeditionary Sea Bases (ESBs) are being named for famous names or places of historical significance to U.S. Marines. Navajo (TATS-6) class towing, salvage, and rescue ships are being named for prominent Native Americans or Native American tribes. Since 1974, at least 21 U.S. military ships have been named for persons who were living at the time the name was announced. The most recent instance occurred on May 6, 2019, when the Navy announced that it was naming the destroyer DDG-51 for former Senator Sam Nunn. Members of the public are sometimes interested in having Navy ships named for their own states or cities, for older U.S. Navy ships (particularly those on which they or their relatives served), for battles in which they or their relatives participated, or for people they admire. Congress has long maintained an interest in how Navy ships are named, and has influenced the naming of certain Navy ships. The Navy suggests that congressional offices wishing to express support for proposals to name a Navy ship for a specific person, place, or thing contact the office of the Secretary of the Navy to make their support known.

Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, foreign aid has increasingly been associated with national security policy. At the same time, many Americans and some Members of Congress view foreign aid as an expense that the United States cannot afford given current budget deficits. In FY2017, U.S. foreign assistance, defined broadly, totaled an estimated $49.87 billion, or 1.2% of total federal budget authority. About 44% of this assistance was for bilateral economic development programs, including political/strategic economic assistance; 35% for military aid and nonmilitary security assistance; 18% for humanitarian activities; and 4% to support the work of multilateral institutions. Assistance can take the form of cash transfers, equipment and commodities, infrastructure, or technical assistance, and, in recent decades, is provided almost exclusively on a grant rather than loan basis. Most U.S. aid is implemented by nongovernmental organizations rather than foreign governments. The United States is the largest foreign aid donor in the world, accounting for about 24% of total official development assistance from major donor governments in 2017 (the latest year for which these data are available). Key foreign assistance trends in the past decade include growth in development aid, particularly global health programs; increased security assistance directed toward U.S. allies in the anti-terrorism effort; and high levels of humanitarian assistance to address a range of crises. Adjusted for inflation, annual foreign assistance funding over the past decade was the highest it has been since the Marshall Plan in the years immediately following World War II. In FY2017, Afghanistan, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, and Egypt received the largest amounts of U.S. aid, reflecting long-standing aid commitments to Israel and Egypt, the strategic significance of Afghanistan and Iraq, and the strategic and humanitarian importance of Jordan as the crisis in neighboring Syria continues. The Near East region received 27% of aid allocated by country or region in FY2017, followed by Africa, at 25%, and South and Central Asia, at 15%.

The rule has been interpreted through precedents, which have tended to narrow its application over time. The 115th Congress reinstated language from the older form of the rule, allowing for the consideration of retrenchments resulting from a reduction of the number and salary of officers or the reduction of compensation of any person paid out of the Treasury.

Additionally, the GAO suggests that CMS establish monitoring and evaluation mechanisms to inform its antifraud strategy and ensure that it is effectively preventing, detecting, and responding to potential fraud. The GAO also notes that CMS has made some progress in addressing fraud risks, but more work is needed to ensure that the agency is effectively managing fraud risks in the Medicare program.

GAO assessed the extent to which DOD has (1) policies on sexual harassment that include CDC principles and relevant legislative elements; (2) processes for maintaining and reporting consistent data on incidents of unwanted sexual behaviors; and (3) overarching efforts, including a prevention strategy, to address unwanted sexual behaviors across the continuum of harm. GAO reviewed DOD policies and pertinent databases, and interviewed agency officials. The Department of Defense's (DOD) policies on sexual harassment include some but not all of the Centers for Disease Control's (CDC) principles for preventing sexual violence and include most relevant legislative elements. GAO identified six principles from CDC's framework for preventing sexual violence, which CDC defines as including sexual harassment. GAO found that Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and military service policies generally include CDC's principles regarding prevention strategies, but none address risk and protective factors, which identify conditions or behaviors that might heighten or lower the risk of sexual harassment victimization or perpetration, respectively. Additionally, a statutory provision in fiscal year 2013 mandated that DOD, among other things, develop a comprehensive sexual harassment policy that includes prevention training, mechanisms for anonymous reporting, and mechanisms for resolving incidents of sexual harassment. OSD and service policies are generally consistent with those required elements except for the inclusion of anonymous reporting. DOD is developing a new department-wide policy that will address sexual harassment, but it is too early to determine how the policy will address these issues. Without policies that include CDC's principles and mechanisms for anonymous reporting, DOD may miss opportunities to address and potentially reduce incidents of unwanted sexual behaviors. Finally, a statutory change in fiscal year 2017 redefined sexual harassment for certain purposes so it is no longer defined solely as a form of sex discrimination but is recognized also as an adverse behavior on the spectrum of behavior that can contribute to an increase in the incidence of sexual assault. While officials indicated a need to update policies, they were unclear on the full implications, if any, of this change. DOD has processes for maintaining and reporting consistent data on incidents of unwanted sexual behaviors including sexual assault and incidents of domestic violence that involve sexual assault, but does not have similar processes for maintaining and reporting data on incidents of sexual harassment. Specifically, DOD uses centralized databases to maintain and report data on incidents of sexual assault and domestic violence that involve sexual assault, but relies on military service-specific databases for information on incidents of sexual harassment. DOD has not established standard data elements and definitions to guide the services in maintaining and reporting data on sexual harassment. Inconsistencies in data elements and definitions generally mean that one service may be maintaining data that is more or less detailed than, or that differs from, the data maintained by other services. Such inconsistencies may create difficulties in reporting department-wide sexual harassment data, since the individual service data must be adapted to fit reporting requirements. DOD has several overarching efforts to address unwanted sexual behaviors across the continuum of harm, including developing an overarching prevention strategy. However, it is unclear whether the strategy under development will contain key elements for long-term and results-oriented strategic planning such as long-term goals, strategies to achieve goals, and metrics to gauge progress. Without incorporating these elements into its overarching prevention strategy, DOD may not be in a position to effectively coordinate and integrate prevention activities and reduce instances of unwanted sexual behaviors. GAO recommends that DOD fully include in its new policy on sexual harassment CDC's principles for sexual violence prevention and mechanisms for anonymous reporting, develop standard data elements and definitions for reporting sexual harassment incidents, and incorporate in its overarching prevention strategy elements key for a long-term, results-oriented strategy. DOD generally concurred with the recommendations."], "length": 12433}
