Democrats, including Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, and Amy Klobuchar, demanded that Republicans delay the hearing due to the late release of documents related to Kavanaugh's time in the George W. Bush White House. Republicans accused Democrats of politicizing the hearing and avoiding substance. Kavanaugh, in his opening statement, emphasized his commitment to being a neutral and impartial arbiter and his independence from President Trump. He also highlighted his experience as a judge and his commitment to upholding the Constitution. The hearing was disrupted by protesters, with 61 individuals arrested inside the hearing room and nine outside. The protests were largely driven by concerns over Kavanaugh's potential impact on abortion rights and the Affordable Care Act. Despite the chaos, Kavanaugh remained calm and composed, and his nomination appears to be on track for confirmation. The hearing highlighted the deep divisions within the Senate and the country over the nomination, with Democrats vowing to continue their opposition. The White House released a statement praising Kavanaugh's qualifications and expressing confidence in his confirmation. The hearing also saw a rare moment of bipartisanship, with Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) criticizing Democrats for their behavior. The hearing is expected to continue on Wednesday, with senators planning to question Kavanaugh on his views on abortion, gun control, and executive power. The nomination is seen as a key test of the Republican Party's ability to confirm a Supreme Court justice despite opposition from Democrats. The hearing was also notable for the release of 42,000 pages of documents related to Kavanaugh's time in the Bush White House, which Democrats argued were withheld without justification.

Astronomers used the Hubble Space Telescope to measure the distance between 19 galaxies with unprecedented accuracy, finding that the universe is expanding at a rate of 73.2 kilometers per second per megaparsec. This rate is higher than the predicted rate based on measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation, which is the leftover glow from the Big Bang. The discrepancy may be due to dark energy, a mysterious force that is thought to be responsible for the acceleration of the universe's expansion. Alternatively, it could be due to dark matter, which is a type of matter that does not emit light and is thought to make up a large portion of the universe's mass. The new measurements also suggest that the universe may be expanding faster than Einstein's theory of general relativity predicts. The Hubble Space Telescope's measurements are based on the observation of Cepheid stars, which are used as cosmic yardsticks to measure distances in the universe. The team also used Type Ia supernovae, which are exploding stars that can be seen from relatively long distances, to measure the expansion rate. The new measurements are more accurate than previous estimates, with a margin of error of only 2.4%. The team's findings are published in an upcoming issue of The Astrophysical Journal. The universe's expansion rate is a key area of research in cosmology, and the new measurements provide important insights into the nature of the universe. The findings also have implications for our understanding of dark energy and dark matter, which are thought to make up a large portion of the universe's mass-energy budget.

If they decided to order the next size up, the sheath wouldn't fit snugly, and liquid could potentially leak out, causing damage. To make the process a little less embarrassing, the sizes were later renamed: large, gigantic, and humongous. Motherboard notes that the urination issue was first brought to the fore by Alan Shepard, who spent hours in the Freedom 7 capsule in advance of a quick 15-minute \"suborbital hop.\" Denied permission to leave the capsule, he opted to pee in his suit—forcing Mission Control to turn off his biomedical sensors until the flow of oxygen in the suit dried the pee, allowing the sensors to be switched on. Today's astronauts enjoy actual restrooms, though MAG systems are provided to astronauts who are operating outside space vehicles.

Monis had a history of violent crime, including being an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife and facing multiple sexual and indecent assault charges. He was also convicted of sending offensive letters to the families of Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan. The siege ended with Monis and two hostages dead, and four others injured. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott questioned why Monis was not on the country's terror watch list, given his long history of violent crime and extremist views. Monis' lawyer, Manny Conditsis, described him as an isolated figure who may have felt he had nothing to lose, leading him to participate in the siege. Monis had been consumed by his conviction for sending offensive letters and had lost a bid to have the charges overturned in the High Court. He had also been charged with being an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife and faced multiple sexual and indecent assault charges. Monis' self-radicalisation was rooted in grievances against the Australian government and increasing marginalisation among his peers. He had posted on his website that Shia Muslims were rejectionists, a key message of extremist Sunnis in the Middle East, and had announced that he had converted from Shia to Sunni Islam and pledged his allegiance to the caliphate declared by the militant group Islamic State.

This discrepancy may be due to unknown subatomic particles, dark energy, or an incomplete understanding of Einstein's theory of relativity. The research, which used data from the Hubble Space Telescope and Hawaii's Keck I telescope, refined the universe's current expansion rate to an unprecedented accuracy of 2.4%. The team measured about 2,400 Cepheid stars in 19 nearby galaxies and compared the apparent brightness of both types of stars to accurately determine their distance. The new data suggest that the universe is expanding faster than expected, which may be an important clue to understanding the mysterious parts of the universe that make up 95% of everything and don't emit light, such as dark energy, dark matter, and dark radiation. The discrepancy between the new measurements and the predicted expansion rate from the Big Bang's afterglow may indicate that there are underlying physical processes pushing space apart that we haven't fully accounted for. This could be due to dark energy, dark matter, or an incomplete understanding of Einstein's theory of relativity. The universe's expansion rate is accelerating, and the new measurements suggest that the distance between cosmic objects will double in about 9.8 billion years.

The study, conducted by researchers at the University of Southern California, tracked the use of cigarettes and e-cigarettes among 5,490 California high school seniors who graduated between 1995 and 2014. The study found that e-cigarettes do not appear to have made a dent in regular cigarette use, and that the rate of teenagers using nicotine - either through tobacco cigarettes or e-cigarettes - is on the rise. The study's lead author, Jessica Barrington-Trimis, noted that e-cigarettes may be recruiting a new group of teenagers to use nicotine, rather than simply replacing cigarette smoking.\n\nA study published in the journal Pediatrics found that the prevalence of e-cigarette use among adolescents in Southern California has increased significantly over the past two decades, with 14% of high school seniors in 2014 reporting use of e-cigarettes or cigarettes in the past 30 days. The study, which analyzed data from the Southern California Children's Health Study, found that the combined prevalence of e-cigarette or cigarette use in 2014 was substantially higher than the prevalence of smoking in 2004, suggesting that e-cigarettes are not simply substituting for cigarettes. The study's lead author, Jessica Barrington-Trimis, noted that e-cigarettes may be recruiting a new group of users who would not have otherwise initiated combustible tobacco product use.\n\nElectronic cigarettes, also known as e-cigarettes, are a booming industry that has gained popularity in recent years. E-cigarettes are battery-operated inhalers that heat up and vaporize liquid containing flavors and nicotine. While e-cigarettes may be safer than smoking tobacco, they are not risk-free, and nicotine is highly addictive.", "answers": ["With the debut of vaping in the US in 2007, there was hope that teens who smoked would replace old-school cigarettes with e-cigarettes, curbing tobacco use. But a new USC study in the journal Pediatrics has found teens who never would have smoked regular cigarettes are experimenting with vaping. Another USC study finds older teens who try vaping are six times more likely to try a tobacco-filled cigarette than non-vapers, per a press release. \"E-cigarettes may be recruiting a new group of kids to tobacco use,\" says Jessica Barrington-Trimis, lead author of both studies. While e-cigs may seem safer than tobacco, if they come pumped with nicotine (some don't), kids can get addicted. The New York Times notes chemicals in the vaping liquid may be harmful; WebMD adds long-term effects are unknown. Using participants from USC's Children's Health Study, scientists followed 5,490 teens who graduated high school in select years between 1995 and 2015, asking them via questionnaire about their tobacco use. It's true that rates among Southern California teens who said they had smoked over the past 30 days fell significantly from 1995 to 2004 (19% to 9%), and slightly more in the decade after that (a bit less than 8% by 2014). But when teens were asked to include e-cigarettes in their assessments, the smoking rate jumped back up to 14% in 2014. And that's got scientists worried, especially with the prevalence of e-cigarettes that come in kid-friendly flavors such as cotton candy. \"E-cigarettes may be safer than regular cigarettes for adults who are transitioning from smoking to vaping, but for youth who have never used any other tobacco products, nicotine experimentation could become nicotine addiction,\" Barrington-Trimis says."], "length": 24917}

The airline Aeroflot told the AP he was booked on a Moscow-Havana flight this morning (the expectation being he'd then travel to Venezuela and then to Ecuador, where WikiLeaks says he will seek asylum), prompting a number of journalists to grab seats on said flight. But Snowden apparently never boarded, reports Business Insider via an article with this headline: \"Russia Just Punked a Bunch of Journalists Who Are Now On Their Way to Havana.\" AP Moscow correspondent Max Seddon confirmed that there was no sign of Snowden, tweeting, \"Cuba here we come. Taxiing down Sheremetevo runway and no sign of Snowden. Seats empty still by 17A.\" How did Snowden get out of Hong Kong yesterday to begin with? Despite the Chinese territory's autonomy, the final decision came from Beijing, sources tell the New York Times. The move lets China save face while avoiding a drawn-out extradition battle. Some legal experts are telling the New York Times the US government goofed in waiting until Saturday to revoke Snowden's passport, though charges were filed June 14.

{"pred": " \nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS) has a complex history with plural marriage, a practice that was introduced by Joseph Smith in the 1840s. According to the LDS, the practice of plural marriage was a commandment from God, and it was intended to increase the number of children born in the gospel covenant. The practice was practiced by some LDS members for over half a century, but it was eventually discontinued in 1890 due to anti-polygamy laws and the Church's desire to comply with them. The practice of plural marriage was not universal among LDS members, and women were free to choose their spouses, whether to enter into a polygamous or monogamous union. The practice was also not without its challenges, including the difficulty of managing multiple wives and children, and the social and cultural stigma associated with it. Despite these challenges, the practice of plural marriage was seen as a trial of faith for many LDS members, and it was a way for them to demonstrate their obedience to God's commandments. Today, the LDS Church no longer practices plural marriage, but it continues to honor the memories of those who practiced it and to recognize its importance in the Church's history. In the 19th century, the practice of plural marriage was seen as a way to \"raise up seed unto God,\" and it resulted in the birth of large numbers of children within faithful LDS homes. The practice also shaped 19th-century Mormon society in many ways, including increasing marriage opportunities for women and reducing economic inequality. However, the practice was also associated with controversy and opposition, and it was eventually discontinued due to external pressures. The LDS Church's history with plural marriage is complex and multifaceted, and it continues to be an important part of the Church's identity and heritage. The practice of plural marriage was also seen as a way to create and strengthen a sense of cohesion and group identification among LDS members, who came to see themselves as a \"peculiar people\" bound to carry out God's commands despite outside opposition. The practice was also associated with the idea of eternal marriage, which was seen as a way to seal loved ones to each other for eternity, on condition of righteousness. The LDS Church's history with plural marriage is a reminder that the practice of faith is often complex and multifaceted, and that it can involve difficult choices and challenges. The Church's decision to discontinue the practice of plural marriage in 1890 was a significant turning point in its history, and it marked a shift", "answers": ["The Mormon church's big revelations didn't stop with its sacred undergarments: In an online essay titled \"Plural Marriage in Kirtland and Nauvoo,\" the church for the first time declares that founder Joseph Smith was a polygamist, with a footnote stating that \"careful estimates\" put his tally of wives at between 30 and 40. The essay explains that Smith was ordered to take multiple wives by an angel who visited him three times between 1834 and 1842; in the last instance, the angel was armed with a sword and threatened a reluctant Smith. The leader, then married to first wife Emma, took his first plural wife, Fanny Alger, in Kirtland, Ohio. Smith and Alger ultimately separated, and the church relocated to Nauvoo, Ill., where he married many more women. The oldest was 56, and the youngest was 14-year-old Helen Mar Kimball; some were already married, a revelation the New York Times describes as the \"biggest bombshell for some.\" The essay explains that a number of marriages, including that with Kimball, were sealed \"for eternity alone,\" suggesting sexual relations weren't involved (the ones that did involve sex were \"for time and eternity\"). What did Emma think of all this? Per the essay, she was none too pleased, though at one time she did accept four of Smith's wives into their home. And what was the reasoning behind what the essay describes as the \"wrenching trial\" of polygamy? Kimball said Smith told her that \"the practice of this principle would be the hardest trial the Saints would ever have to test their faith.\" Two more essays discuss plural marriage in the church's later years; they're part of an effort the church is making to share \"reliable, faith-promoting\" info about its past, the church's historian tells the Times.

The defeat is \"the most surreal and embarrassing night in US soccer history,\" writes Grant Wahl for Sports Illustrated. \"Unthinkable,\" declares the New York Times. \"With that loss, the USMNT gave a nation the lowest point in its sporting history, and it’s not really close,\" writes Andrew Joseph for USA Today. \"It took 90-plus minutes for United States soccer to regress 30 years,\" writes Frank Isola at the Daily News. The kicker is that two other games fell the wrong way in unexpected fashion, one on a \"phantom goal,\" sealing the US fate. Honduras rallied from two goals down to beat Mexico, and Panama rallied from one goal back to beat Costa Rica. Had either of those games gone the other way, or had the US even tied Trinidad and Tobago (which had previously been eliminated from qualifying), the Americans would have secured a spot in Russia for the 2018 competition. Of note: Phantom goal: The winning goal scored by Panama against Costa Rica didn't cross the goal line, per CBS Sports, which has video here.

The FBI and state police were involved in the investigation, and the suspect was eventually identified as Dylann Storm Roof, a 21-year-old white man who had a history of racist views and had been banned from a local mall. Roof was arrested in North Carolina and extradited to South Carolina to face charges. The incident highlighted the ongoing issue of racial violence and hate crimes in the United States.

The hackathon aims to bring together 150 engineers, designers, parents, public health researchers, and lactation consultants to brainstorm new innovations. The current breast pump design is outdated and has several problems, including a loud motor, too many parts, and difficulty in cleaning. The hackathon organizers believe that improving breast pump technology can save lives and money, and that it is a symbol of a technology that could be vastly improved to support healthier and happier families. The event will feature a variety of projects, including smarter interfaces and guided experiences, data collection, and innovative designs for breast pumps. The organizers hope to make space for innovation in family life more broadly and support a variety of different kinds of projects at the event. The hackathon is free and open to the public, but space is limited. The event will take place on September 20 and 21 in Cambridge, and tickets can be purchased through Eventbrite. The organizers are also offering scholarships for attendees who work with low-income mothers to be able to attend the event. The breast pump is a symbol of the modern work-life conundrum, and improving its design can help women balance their careers and family responsibilities.

The system uses functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to detect patterns in brain activity, enabling patients to answer \"yes\" or \"no\" to questions. In a study, four patients with CLIS were trained to use the system, and all were able to communicate effectively. The patients were asked questions about their quality of life, and surprisingly, all reported being \"happy\" with their lives. This finding challenges the common assumption that locked-in patients are miserable. The researchers believe that the patients' positive outlook may be due to their focus on social interactions and their inability to feel or move their bodies, which may lead to a state of meditation. The study's findings suggest that fNIRS may be a viable means of communication for patients with CLIS, and the researchers are working on developing a system that allows patients to communicate more proactively.

In other words, they had \"locked-in syndrome,\" meaning total motor paralysis in spite of normal cognitive and emotional processing. Researchers at the University of Tübingen in Germany fitted the patients with caps through which they could observe changes in blood flow in different parts of the brain, they explain in the journal PLOS Biology. They first asked the patients to think yes or no in response to simple statements such as their spouse's name, and moved on to more personal questions when that was mastered. “It’s the first sign that completely locked-in syndrome may be abolished forever, because with all of these patients, we can now ask them the most critical questions in life,” says researcher Niels Birbaumer. The patients, all of whom are on ventilators and being cared for at home, range in age from 24 to 76. The team did stumble on a couple surprises. For instance, all four patients suggested they were \"happy\" with their lives in spite of being locked-in. (Birmbaumer suggests this might be because of something akin to meditation.)

The zoo's director, Thane Maynard, stated that the decision to shoot Harambe was made to save the boy's life, as the gorilla's size and strength posed a great danger.

The study, which included 891 patients, found that for women who meet certain criteria, taking out cancerous nodes has no advantage in terms of survival or reducing the risk of cancer recurrence. In fact, the procedure can cause complications such as infection and lymphedema. The study's findings suggest that the traditional approach to breast cancer treatment may need to be reevaluated. The researchers found that the women in the study who had chemotherapy and radiation, which probably wiped out any disease in the nodes, did not benefit from having their lymph nodes removed.

The study's lead author, Dr. Armando E. Giuliano, said that the results should not come as a surprise, but they will be. He noted that surgeons and medical oncologists have been slow to accept that removing lymph nodes is not necessary in all cases.

The study's findings are consistent with those of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project B04 trial, which also found no significant survival differences between treatment groups.

The church investigated the claim and found no evidence of fraud or heresy, and a long history of shrine-related conversions, cures, and other signs of divine intervention. The Bishop of Green Bay, David L.

Despite efforts to improve the pipe, riders were considering their options, including protesting or pushing back the competition. Shaun White, a two-time gold medal winner, expressed frustration with the pipe and said he'd have trouble throwing his planned tricks.

The competition ultimately went ahead, with Shaun White finishing fourth and Iouri Podladtchikov of Switzerland winning the gold medal. The event was notable for being the first time since 2002 that no American won a medal in the halfpipe competition.

The coalition has also released a new television ad featuring a survivor of the Aurora shooting, asking presidential candidates to explain how they will reduce gun violence. In addition, the coalition has launched an interactive map showing how many mental health records each state has submitted to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), and has called on President Obama to strengthen and better enforce gun laws. The coalition has also introduced legislation to close gaps in the background check system and has received support from key members of Congress. The data from the investigations and reports has shown that states and federal agencies fail to send millions of records to the NICS, enabling substance abusers, the mentally ill, and other dangerous individuals to pass background checks and purchase firearms.

Matt Damon's comments on the movement have been criticized by actress Minnie Driver, who argues that men cannot understand what abuse is like on a daily level and should not attempt to differentiate or explain sexual misconduct against women. Driver believes that men should not be granted the power to interpret abuse inflicted on women without the risk of redoubling an injustice they can scarcely understand. Damon's comments, which suggested that there is a \"spectrum of behavior\" in sexual misconduct, were seen as tone-deaf and part of the problem. Driver also criticized Damon's defense of comedian Louis C.K., who was accused of misconduct including masturbating in front of women. Damon's comments were seen as an attempt to compartmentalize and judge what is worse and what is not, rather than acknowledging that all abuse is wrong. The #MeToo movement has highlighted the need for men to listen and support women, rather than trying to explain or justify their experiences. Driver's comments reflect a growing sentiment that men should take a backseat and allow women to speak out and be heard.

The indictment was filed under new German legal reasoning that allows prosecutors to pursue cases against Nazis who helped operate concentration camps during the war, even without evidence of a specific crime. The camp's victims included 65,000 people who died from malnutrition, disease, and other causes, as well as those who were put to death in gas chambers or shot.

A Holocaust survivor, Judith Meisel, played a key role in the indictment by identifying one of the former guards, Johann Rehbogen, as a teenage SS officer who taunted her and other female prisoners at the camp. Meisel's testimony was crucial in helping prosecutors build their case against the men. The indictment is a reminder that even decades after the Holocaust, justice can still be pursued and that those responsible for the atrocities committed during the war can still be held accountable.

The complaint, filed by William Brennan, alleges that Christie knew about the lane closures and did nothing to stop them, which constitutes second-degree official misconduct. The lane closures caused significant traffic problems and were later revealed to be a politically motivated act of retribution against Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich, a Democrat who did not support Christie's re-election bid. The scandal led to the indictment of two of Christie's former aides, Bill Baroni and Bridget Anne Kelly, who were found guilty on all counts in November 2016. The federal investigation into the scandal also led to the guilty plea of David Wildstein, a Christie appointee at the Port Authority, who testified that he discussed the plot with multiple members of Christie's senior staff before and during the lane closures. Wildstein's testimony suggested that Christie was informed of the lane closures as they were occurring on September 11, 2013, which could be considered a case of official misconduct. The Bergen County Prosecutor's Office, which would decide whether to bring an indictment against Christie, is likely to recuse itself due to Christie's appointment of the prosecutor. The citizen's complaint is seen as a new development in the Bridgegate scandal, which has already led to the indictment of several high-ranking officials in Christie's administration. The scandal has been widely criticized, with some experts arguing that state law was more clearly violated than federal law, and that the governor's actions were a clear case of malfeasance in office. The Bridgegate panel may have to reconvene to investigate further, and the case could potentially go to a grand jury. The citizen's complaint has been filed in Fort Lee Municipal Court, and a court official confirmed the filing. The complaint alleges that Christie's failure to stop the lane closures constitutes official misconduct, and that the governor's inaction was a result of his knowledge of the lane closures. The complaint has been sent to the Superior Court in Hackensack, per state law. If a superior court judge determines a probable cause, the case would go to a county prosecutor, and then if that office moves forward, to a grand jury.

Bill Brennan, whom the Star-Ledger describes as a \"citizen activist\" and Christie's office describes as \"a known serial complainant and political activist with a history of abusing the judicial system,\" filed the complaint last month over the 2013 BridgeGate scandal. Per Brennan's complaint, Christie knew lane closures were happening and could have put a stop to the whole thing. The complaint is based on testimony from the trial against former Christie aide Bridget Anne Kelly and former Port Authority executive Bill Baroni. During the trial, a man Christie appointed to Port Authority testified that both he and Baroni told Christie about the lane closures during a 9/11 ceremony (the lanes were closed from Sept. 9 to Sept. 13, 2013). Now that the judge has ruled the complaint can move forward, it will go to the Bergen County Prosecutor's Office so a decision can be made as to whether Christie should be indicted.

The critique argues that the League's lawyers made several key errors, including assuming that the gauging of the Patriots' footballs took up to 9 minutes, which is unlikely given the time constraints of halftime. The critique also points out that the League's lawyers refused to release the interview notes of the seven League witnesses to halftime gauging, which would have provided valuable information about the sequence of events. The critique further argues that the League's lawyers manipulated the text evidence to create the myth of a deflation scheme, and that the Jastremski/McNally texts do not support the existence of such a scheme. The critique also questions the accuracy of the PSI measurements taken at halftime, citing the lack of precision and the fact that the gauges used were not tested. The critique concludes that the Wells Report is a flawed piece of advocacy that ignores the scientific evidence and relies on dubious interpretations of ambiguous texts. The Patriots have responded to the Wells Report with a 20,000-word rebuttal, which includes a Nobel laureate's rejection of the Wells Report's scientific evidence and a claim that team attendant Jim McNally referred to himself as \"the deflator\" because he was losing weight, not because he was removing air pressure from Brady's footballs.

In other coverage: The Guardian looks at John McCain's involvement, which apparently included clandestine efforts to obtain the dossier after hearing about it from a diplomat during a conference in Canada. \"Upon examination of the contents, and unable to make a judgment about their accuracy, I delivered the information to the director of the FBI,\" McCain said in a statement Wednesday. The AP reports that it has been unable to contact Steele. A neighbor of the former spy, who lives outside London, says Steele and his family are away and it's not clear when they will return. Intelligence chiefs are defending their decision to take the very unusual step of attaching a summary of the unverified dossier to last week's briefing on Russian hacking, the Washington Post reports. \"Part of our obligation is to ensure that policymakers are provided with the fullest possible picture of any matters that might affect national security,\" Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Wednesday. He said he spoke with Trump and expressed dismay at the \"extremely corrosive\" leaks in the press. Early Thursday, Trump tweeted that Clapper had called him \"to denounce the false and fictitious report that was illegally circulated.\" He added: \"Made up, phony facts.Too bad!\" Politico looks at how Democrats are dealing with Trump's Russia troubles. So far, senators have been more restrained than House members, some of whom have started referring to Trump as \"Moscow Donald.\" The New York Times reports that Trump is facing a backlash from Jewish groups for wondering if we \"are living in Nazi Germany\" when he was criticizing intelligence agencies' handling of what he called \"fake news.\" At the Intercept, Glenn Greenwald calls the dossier \"farcical\" and warns that this episode could backfire badly for Democratic operatives and others treating the dossier as gospel. He warns that if it is proved false, it will \"forever discredit ... future journalistic exposés that are based on actual, corroborated wrongdoing.\""], "length": 26474}

Cindy Hyde-Smith is expected to win a special election runoff against Democrat Mike Espy, despite controversy surrounding her comments about public hangings. Hyde-Smith's campaign has focused on her support for President Donald Trump and her conservative values, while Espy has tried to appeal to black voters and white swing voters. Trump has endorsed Hyde-Smith and held two rallies for her in Mississippi, which may have helped to boost her chances. The outcome of the election will determine whether Republicans will hold a 52-53 majority in the Senate. Hyde-Smith's victory would also mean that she would be the first woman elected to Congress from Mississippi. The election has been closely watched due to its potential impact on the balance of power in the Senate and the state's history of racism and violence against blacks. Hyde-Smith's comments about public hangings have sparked controversy, with several businesses, including Walmart, demanding that she return their donations. Despite this, Hyde-Smith has maintained a strong lead in the polls and is expected to win the election. The outcome of the election will be a significant test of the Republican Party's ability to win elections in a state with a history of racism and violence against blacks. The election has also highlighted the importance of voter turnout, particularly among black voters, who make up nearly 40% of the state's electorate.

She claims Cosby then took her to a bedroom and molested her, but she does not remember the exact details of the incident. Goins' allegations are significant because they fall within California's statute of limitations for filing criminal charges, making it possible for prosecutors to pursue a case against Cosby. The allegations are also notable because they come from a woman who is not one of the many women who have come forward in recent years to accuse Cosby of similar behavior. Goins' lawyer has stated that she plans to make a full statement to the Los Angeles Police Department, and the LAPD has confirmed that they are investigating the allegations.

According to a recent analysis, Democrats have a 53% chance of winning a Senate majority, while Republicans hold 24 of the 34 seats up for reelection. The political geography favors Democrats, with none of the 10 seats they are defending in states that were won by either John McCain or Mitt Romney in 2008 or 2012. However, Republicans are defending seats in states that are either blue or purple, which could make it difficult for them to hold onto their seats. The Senate forecast has identified 11 seats to watch, with Illinois, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania being the most likely Democratic pickups. In these states, the Democratic candidates are favored to win, with Illinois being the most likely to go Democratic. The forecast also identifies Missouri, Nevada, and New Hampshire as tossup states, where the outcome is uncertain. In these states, the Democratic candidates are running close to the Republican candidates, and the outcome will depend on the turnout of voters. The forecast also identifies Indiana and North Carolina as plausible Democratic pickups, but the outcome is uncertain.

The coup was led by a faction within the Turkish military, which was allegedly backed by the Gülen Movement, a moderate Sunni cleric and his followers. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan blamed the coup on the Gülen Movement and demanded that Fethullah Gülen, the leader of the movement, be returned to Turkey to stand trial. However, the US administration has maintained that Turkey has not provided persuasive evidence that Gülen was behind the coup. The coup attempt was thwarted by Erdogan's supporters, who took to the streets to defend the government, and the military was eventually defeated. The aftermath of the coup saw a massive purge of the military and judiciary, with over 3,000 people detained, including top military commanders and judges. The US expressed support for Turkey's government and urged the country to follow the rule of law. The coup attempt was widely condemned, and the international community called for stability and calm in Turkey. The event marked a significant turning point in Turkey's history, with Erdogan's government consolidating power and the Gülen Movement facing increased scrutiny and persecution. The incident highlighted the complex and often contentious relationship between Erdogan's government and the Gülen Movement, which has been a key player in Turkish politics for decades. The coup attempt also raised concerns about the stability of the region and the potential for further conflict in Turkey.

Gulen says he condemns the coup attempt \"in the strongest terms.\" The AP reports that John Kerry says the US would consider an extradition request for Gulen, though nothing has been received yet and firm evidence would be required. \"We fully anticipate that there will be questions raised about Mr. Gulen,\" Kerry told reporters. \"And obviously we would invite the government of Turkey, as we always do, to present us with any legitimate evidence that withstands scrutiny.\" The New York Times looks at how the fallout from the coup will make the region's politics even more complicated for the US and Europe, which saw Erdogan's government as a stable and reliable ally. \"The danger here is this could spiral out of control and turn into a full-blown civil war,\" says former US Ambassador to Turkey Eric S.

Almost 3,000 military service members have been arrested and almost the same number of judges have been removed from their duties in what appears to be a nationwide purge of Gulen supporters, the Guardian reports. Reuters reports that Erdogan, who had been vacationing on the country's southeast coast, addressed thousands of supporters after flying into Ankara's airport early Saturday. \" This uprising is a gift from God to us because this will be a reason to cleanse our army,\" he said.

The review, the largest post-conviction review ever done by the FBI, will include cases conducted by all FBI Laboratory hair and fiber examiners since at least 1985. The review comes after The Washington Post reported that Justice Department officials had known for years that flawed forensic work might have led to the convictions of potentially innocent people but had not performed a thorough review of the cases. The review will be conducted in collaboration with the Innocence Project and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. The FBI's review is a significant step towards addressing the issue of flawed forensic evidence in the criminal justice system, which has been a long-standing concern. The review is also a response to the growing scrutiny of the nation's forensic science system, with the National Academy of Sciences urging the White House and Congress to remove crime labs from police and prosecutors' control or strengthen the science and standards underpinning the system. The review is expected to be a lengthy and complex process, with the exact number of cases to be reviewed unknown. The FBI has dedicated considerable time and resources to addressing the issues, with the goal of reaching final determinations in the coming months. The review is a critical step towards ensuring the scientific validity and accuracy of the forensic science used in the criminal justice system.

The incident sparked outrage on social media, with many criticizing the zoo's decision to shoot Harambe and blaming the boy's parents for not supervising their child. An online petition calling for \"justice for Harambe\" gathered over 8,000 signatures in less than 24 hours. The Cincinnati Zoo defended its decision, stating that the boy was in \"imminent danger\" and that tranquilizers may not have taken effect in time to save the boy. The zoo also pointed out that this was the first time Gorilla World had experienced a breach since the exhibit opened in 1978. The incident highlighted the risks and challenges of keeping animals in captivity, with some arguing that captivity is never acceptable for gorillas or other primates. A petition calling for the boy's parents to be held accountable for the lack of supervision and negligence that caused Harambe to lose his life gathered over 60,000 signatures. The Cincinnati Zoo temporarily shut its gorilla exhibit following the incident, and the boy was taken to a local hospital and is expected to fully recover. The incident has sparked a wider debate about the ethics of keeping animals in captivity and the responsibility of parents to supervise their children. The western lowland gorilla subspecies is critically endangered, with fewer than 175,000 individuals remaining in the wild, and the loss of Harambe is a significant blow to the species. The incident has also raised questions about the use of tranquilizers in emergency situations and the availability of fast-acting tranquilizers at zoos. The shooting of Harambe has been compared to the shooting of two lions in a zoo in Chile last week, which also sparked criticism from activists. The incident has highlighted the need for zoos to balance the safety of visitors with the welfare of the animals in their care.

The US has indicted seven Russian agents for cyber crimes linked to the Dutch investigation, including hacking into the world anti-doping agency and a US nuclear energy facility. The alleged plot against the OPCW demonstrates the GRU's disregard for global values and rules that keep us all safe, according to a joint statement from British Prime Minister Theresa May and her Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte. The incident is part of a sustained pattern of hostile cyberspace activity by Russia, according to British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt. The US Department of Justice announced charges against the seven Russian agents, accusing them of hacking into the world anti-doping agency, the OPCW, and of cyberattacks aimed at a US nuclear energy facility. The indictment accused the seven members of Russia's military intelligence agency, the GRU, of hacking into the world anti-doping agency, the OPCW, and of cyberattacks aimed at a US nuclear energy facility.

The breach was part of a wave of Iranian hacks on U.S. banks and occurred just three years after a computer worm believed to be built by the U.S. and Israel damaged nuclear infrastructure in Iran. The incident fits a pattern openly described by U.S. officials who warn that hackers from Russia, Iran, and China are testing U.S. critical infrastructure networks for vulnerabilities. The U.S. has more than 57,000 industrial-control systems connected to the Internet, and the Department of Homeland Security has issued repeated public warnings to utilities that their networks are at risk. A top DHS official recently told energy firm executives that ISIS is beginning to perpetrate cyberattacks. The incident raises questions about the murky set of guidelines surrounding cyberwarfare, with experts saying there are three distinct kinds of cyber intrusions: corporate espionage, hacks intended to do damage to infrastructure, and traditional intelligence-gathering efforts. The U.S. response to different incidents is unclear, with lawmakers calling for clear standards governing the U.S. response. The breach involving Calpine Corp. is particularly disturbing because the cyberspies grabbed so much information, including user names and passwords that could be used to connect remotely to Calpine's networks, detailed engineering drawings of networks and power stations, and additional diagrams showing how those local plants transmit information back to the company's virtual cloud. The hackers had gained access to an aging, outdated power system, and the breach began at least as far back as August 2013 and could still be going on today. The incident highlights the vulnerability of the U.S. power grid to cyberattacks, with experts saying that skilled hackers could have used the stolen information to shut down generating stations and cause a blackout. The grid is largely privately owned and has entire sections that fall outside federal regulation, leaving the industry poorly defended against a growing universe of hackers seeking to access its networks. The incident also raises concerns about the ability of the U.S. to respond to cyberattacks, with experts saying that the government's response to these hacks is often protected and sometimes classified, and many are never even reported to the government. The breach involving Calpine Corp. is just one of many incidents that have highlighted the vulnerability of the U.S. power grid to cyberattacks, with experts warning that the consequences of a large-scale blackout could be devastating, including a cost to the economy of hundreds of billions of dollars, raised mortality rates at hospitals, and cut", "answers": ["Iranian hackers who targeted American financial institutions two years ago were also apparently curious about a small dam in upstate New York—and officials are worried what this means for the security of US industrial infrastructure overall, the Wall Street Journal reports.

In fact, per a separate AP investigation, \"sophisticated foreign hackers\" have accessed about a dozen power networks here, attacks that the AP says the US public is rarely informed about. US infrastructure is often run by creaky systems that were previously offline, which kept them relatively safe. But, \"against the advice of hacking gurus,\" as the Journal notes, many companies started connecting their systems to the Internet without adequately securing them.

The main arguments or conclusions of each passage are as follows: \nThe management of IT acquisitions and operations is a high-risk area for federal agencies, with many failed projects and cost overruns. The Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) and the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) aim to improve IT management and security. However, agencies have not fully implemented these laws, and CIOs have limited authority and oversight. \nThe security of federal IT is a critical issue, with many agencies struggling to protect their systems and information from security breaches. The FISMA requires agencies to develop and implement information security programs, but many agencies have not done so effectively. The GAO has made numerous recommendations to improve IT security, but many have not been implemented. \nThe use of commercially hosted payloads in space systems is a promising approach for increasing affordability and reducing acquisition timelines. However, DOD has limited experience with hosted payloads, and there are logistical challenges to matching government payloads with commercial hosts. The Hosted Payload Office (HPO) is developing tools to help address these challenges, but more data and analysis are needed to inform decisions on the use of hosted payloads. \nThe passages also discuss the controversy surrounding Jeffrey Tambor's behavior on the set of the TV show Transparent. Tambor has denied allegations of sexual harassment, but his behavior has been described as \"mean\" and \"difficult\" by his co-stars. The controversy has led to a re-evaluation of Tambor's role on the show, and he will not return for the final season. \nThe passages also highlight the importance of learning from mistakes and growing as a person. Jason Bateman and Alia Shawkat have spoken out in support of Tambor, but also acknowledged the importance of listening to and believing victims of sexual harassment. The Me Too movement has brought attention to the issue of sexual harassment and the need for accountability. \nOverall, the selected passages highlight the importance of effective IT management and security, the use of commercially hosted payloads in space systems, and the need for accountability and growth in personal and professional relationships.

The extension showed the locations, which were accurate to within three feet, in a group chat with people he barely knew. Facebook responded by asking Khanna to disable the extension and later rescinded his internship offer. Khanna's extension highlighted a privacy flaw in Facebook Messenger that had been known for three years, where the app automatically shared users' locations with anyone they messaged. The extension was downloaded over 85,000 times, and Facebook eventually changed its default settings to require users to opt-in to share their location. Khanna's experience showed that transparency and public attention can motivate companies to change their practices. The incident also raised questions about the balance between innovation and privacy, and the role of users in protecting their own data. Khanna's extension was a tool for showing users how their data was being used, and it sparked a wider conversation about the importance of transparency and user control in the digital age. The incident also highlighted the need for companies to be more proactive in protecting users' privacy and to be more transparent about their data collection practices. Khanna's experience was a case study in how a single individual can make a difference in the digital world, and it showed that users have the power to demand more from companies when it comes to their data.

A Harvard University junior lost his Facebook internship two hours before he had planned to travel to it after he exploited a privacy issue in the social network's Messenger system.

The flaw was that those locations could be seen by anyone in a group chat, even if the person who sent the message wasn't friends with everyone else in the group. And so Khanna developed a browser app called Marauder's Map that exposed, on a map, the geo-location data that was being shared.

By the 28th, CNN, the Washington Post, and many others had covered his findings; the extension was downloaded 85,000 times. That same day, Facebook asked Khanna to disable the app; he did. The company also deactivated location sharing on desktops and released a June 4 update that required users to opt in to location sharing.

Weiner has denied the allegations, stating that he has \"repeatedly demonstrated terrible judgment about the people I have communicated with online and the things I have sent.\" However, a cache of online messages obtained by the Daily Mail suggests that Weiner was aware that the girl was underage and had engaged in explicit conversations with her. The girl, who has not been named, claimed that Weiner had asked her to dress up in \"school-girl\" outfits for him on a video messaging application and had pressed her to engage in \"rape fantasies.\" Weiner's wife, Huma Abedin, announced that they had separated in the wake of another sexting controversy.

The FBI and the New York Police Department have opened preliminary investigations of the allegations, and prosecutors in the office of US Attorney Preet Bharara have issued a subpoena for Weiner's cell phone and other records. Weiner has provided a statement to the Daily Mail, in which he says that he has \"no one to blame but me for putting myself in this position\" and that he is \"sorry.\" The girl's father has expressed concern that Weiner may be sexting with other underage girls, and has stated that he did not contact authorities to report Weiner because his daughter asked him not to. The girl has also spoken out about her experience, stating that she was \"scared\" and \"felt bad\" about talking to Weiner, but that she continued to talk to him until July.

The study found that these players were more hostile towards female-voiced teammates, while higher-skilled players were more positive and supportive. The researchers suggest that this behavior is driven by an evolutionary perspective, where lower-skilled males feel threatened by the presence of a female competitor and respond with aggression to maintain their social status. The study provides evidence that sexist behavior is not solely determined by social and cultural environments, but is also influenced by biological and evolutionary factors. The researchers argue that understanding these factors is crucial for addressing sexism and promoting equality.

The rover's discoveries suggest that early Mars was habitable, with a lake existing in Gale Crater around 3.5 to 4 billion years ago. The lake's presence is supported by the presence of clay minerals and key chemical ingredients for life, including sulfur, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and carbon. The rover's findings also indicate that the lake could have supported a class of microbes called chemolithoautotrophs, which obtain energy by breaking down rocks and minerals. While the rover was not designed to hunt for signs of life on Mars, the discovery of a habitable environment raises the possibility that life may have existed on the planet in the past. The findings are significant because they suggest that habitable environments were present on Mars more recently than previously thought, and that the planet may have had a more Earth-like environment in the past.

The Obama administration is refining its use of offensive cyber operations to counter evolving threats of electronic assaults against the United States. President Obama has ordered his senior national security and intelligence officials to draw up a list of potential overseas targets for US cyber-attacks. The administration has also been working to establish a potentially aggressive cyber warfare doctrine, which has raised concerns over the increasing militarization of the internet. Meanwhile, President Obama is set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at a summit in California, where they will discuss cybersecurity and other issues. The meeting is seen as a milestone in the nations' often tense and generally stilted four-decade diplomatic history. The Sunnylands estate, where the meeting will take place, has a history of hosting world leaders, including previous US presidents and foreign dignitaries. The estate's owner, Leonore Annenberg, had envisioned it as a place for American presidents to relax and parley with world leaders, particularly those from Pacific powers. The meeting between Obama and Xi is seen as a step towards realizing this vision. The Obama administration's efforts to establish a cyber warfare doctrine have been met with criticism, with some arguing that it could lead to an escalation of cyber attacks and potentially even physical conflict. The US has already participated in at least one major cyber attack, the use of the Stuxnet computer worm targeted on Iranian uranium enrichment centrifuges. The directive on cyber operations emphasizes that all US cyber operations must be conducted in accordance with US law and only as a complement to diplomatic and military options. However, it also makes clear how both offensive and defensive cyber operations are central to US strategy. The administration's focus on cybersecurity is part of its broader efforts to address the growing threat of cyber attacks, which has been identified as the top national security threat by the director of national intelligence. The Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (Cispa) has been proposed as a means of enhancing cyber security, but has raised concerns over online privacy. The Obama administration's efforts to address the cyber threat are seen as a key aspect of its national security strategy. The meeting between Obama and Xi is seen as an opportunity to address the issue of cybersecurity and other pressing issues in the US-China relationship.

For six years, his gambling habit spiraled out of control: He sneaked off to gamble when his wife thought he was working, embezzled nearly $4 million from his firm, and drained his family's savings—until the day in 2012 he decided to end his life. After his suicide, Stacy started researching gambling addiction (she hadn't even known about her husband's problem) and filed suit against the West Virginia casino where he was a regular, as well as the maker of the slot machines there. Experts relay how casinos track and target addicted gamblers, supply ready flows of cash via on-site ATMs, and offer plenty of perks to keep them coming back. But it's the modern-day slot machines themselves, with deceptive technology called virtual reel mapping, that seem to be designed to lull gamblers into a trance—or what the industry refers to as \"continuous gaming productivity\"—so they don't stop playing.

The scandal began on September 9, 2013, when two of three toll lanes for a local street entrance were closed during morning rush hour, causing significant traffic congestion and delays for school transportation and emergency responses. The lane closures were ordered by David Wildstein, a Christie appointee, without notification to Fort Lee government and police officials. The closures were later revealed to be a retribution attack against Fort Lee's Mayor Mark Sokolich, a Democrat, for not supporting Christie in the 2013 New Jersey gubernatorial election. The scandal led to a federal investigation, and Wildstein entered a guilty plea, while Bridget Anne Kelly and Bill Baroni were found guilty on all counts in November 2016. Christie's political standing was badly damaged by the scandal, and he dropped out of the presidential race after a poor showing in the New Hampshire primary. The scandal was widely cited as a major factor in the early demise of Christie's 2016 presidential ambitions. A citizen's complaint was filed against Christie in Fort Lee Municipal Court, alleging official misconduct in the second degree, and a judge ruled that there was enough probable cause to move forward with the case. The complaint alleges that Christie knew of the lane closures while they were happening and failed to stop them, which constitutes official misconduct. The case will now go to the Bergen County Prosecutor's Office, which will decide whether to bring an indictment against Christie. The prosecutor, Gurbir S. Grewal, is a Christie appointee and may recuse himself in favor of an independent prosecutor. The scandal has been extensively covered in the media, and the Bridgegate trial has been ongoing, with the government resting its case after 15 days and 18 witnesses. The defense has begun presenting its case, with Christie's former general counsel Charlie McKenna testifying that he believed the lane closures were part of a traffic study until emails suggesting otherwise emerged in January 2014. McKenna claimed that he didn't find it odd that New Jersey residents were kept in the dark about the lane closures, which slowed emergency vehicles in Fort Lee, because it was all done for the sake of science.

The system uses functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to detect changes in brain activity and translate them into \"yes\" or \"no\" responses. Four patients with CLIS were trained to use the system, and they were able to answer questions with an accuracy rate of over 70%. The patients were also able to express their quality of life, with all four indicating that they were \"happy\" with life. This breakthrough technology has the potential to transform the lives of people with CLIS, who are often unable to communicate with the world. The researchers believe that this technology could be used to develop a system that allows patients to communicate more proactively, rather than simply answering questions. This study suggests that patients with CLIS may be more satisfied with their quality of life than previously thought, and that they may be able to experience a sense of happiness and contentment despite their physical limitations. The researchers are optimistic about the potential of this technology to improve the lives of people with CLIS and to challenge our preconceived notions about what it means to be \"locked-in\". The study's findings have significant implications for the field of neurology and for our understanding of the human brain and its capabilities. The researchers are now working to develop a more portable and cost-effective system that can be used in a wider range of settings. The study's lead author, Niels Birbaumer, believes that this technology could be used to help patients with CLIS to communicate with their loved ones and to express their thoughts and feelings in a more meaningful way.

Researchers at the University of Tübingen in Germany fitted the patients with caps through which they could observe changes in blood flow in different parts of the brain, they explain in the journal PLOS Biology. They first asked the patients to think yes or no in response to simple statements such as their spouse's name, and moved on to more personal questions when that was mastered. “It’s the first sign that completely locked-in syndrome may be abolished forever, because with all of these patients, we can now ask them the most critical questions in life,” says researcher Niels Birbaumer.

The researchers in Passage 2 and Passage 3 argue that sexism is triggered by a threat to a male's position in the hierarchy, particularly when a female competitor enters the scene. They conducted a study using an online first-person shooter video game, Halo 3, where they observed that lower-skilled players were more hostile towards a female-voiced teammate, especially when performing poorly. The researchers suggest that this behavior is an attempt to disregard a female's performance and suppress her disturbance on the hierarchy to retain their social rank. They also found that higher-skilled players were more positive towards a female teammate, suggesting that they were switching to a supportive, and potentially, mate attraction role. The study provides a unique perspective into female-directed hostility and highlights the importance of considering an evolutionary perspective when exploring the factors that affect male hostility towards women. The researchers argue that teaching young males that losing to the opposite sex is not socially debilitating may be a way to counter sexism. The study also suggests that video games offer a unique opportunity to examine variation in sexist behaviors and the situations that result in changes in sexist attitudes. The researchers found that the frequency of negative comments towards a female teammate decreased as focal-player performance improved, and that higher-skilled players were more supportive of a female teammate. The study's findings support an evolutionary argument for why low-status, low-performing males are hostile towards female competitors.

Of the 11,000 people studied, 2% were vegetarians, 10% former vegetarians, and 88% lifelong meat-eaters.

Brunke's neighbor, Garry Cordell, and his girlfriend, Marietta Carlson, were also charged with the murders. However, in a surprising twist, Cordell changed his story, claiming that he and Carlson had committed the murders alone, and that Brunke was not involved. The prosecutor, Tim Noble, agreed to let Brunke plead to reduced charges in exchange for his testimony against Cordell. The case was highly publicized, with the victims' families expressing outrage and suspicion about the handling of the case. The community was both mesmerized and suspicious about how the case unfolded, with many questioning whether Brunke had gotten away with murder. The case highlighted the growing drug problem in the quiet community and put the young prosecutor on the hot seat.

And Aldrich did steal a cocaine stash from Brunke's yard, which was followed by a text from Brunke ostensibly meant to lure Aldrich to come over for some free morphine. Aldrich headed to Brunke's house, along with Nelson and Hutchinson, which is where the story takes a weird turn. At first Cordell and his girlfriend, Marietta Carlson, confessed they and Brunke had killed the victims, though the stories kept changing; Brunke denied participating. But then, despite what looked to be certain convictions for all three, Carlson died while in custody, and Cordell suddenly dropped a bombshell: He and Carlson had committed all the murders themselves and Brunke hadn't been present (though he says Brunke did help set the car on fire with the victims' bodies in it). What some believe: Brunke may have paid off Cordell, an unemployed drifter, or promised to take care of Cordell's elderly mother if he took the blame.

The scandal began on September 9, 2013, when two of three toll lanes for a local street entrance were closed during morning rush hour. Local officials, emergency services, and the public were not notified of the lane closures, which Fort Lee declared a threat to public safety. The resulting back-ups and gridlock on local streets ended only when the two lanes were reopened on Friday, September 13, 2013, by an order from Port Authority Executive Director Patrick Foye. The scandal was widely covered in the media, with many outlets investigating the matter and publishing stories about the lane closures and the potential motives behind them. The New York Times reported that the e-mails discussing the lane closure \"could represent evidence that government resources were used for political purposes, a potential crime.\" The U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey, Paul J. Fishman, opened a preliminary federal inquiry into matters related to the toll lane closures, and the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation also opened its own inquiry into the closure. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) conducted an internal review and investigation into the lane closures, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Manhattan District Attorney's office also launched investigations into the matter.

The storm has also left millions without access to food, water, and shelter, with many resorting to desperate measures such as breaking into homes of the dead to scavenge for supplies. The Philippine government has imposed a nighttime curfew in Tacloban, one of the worst-hit cities, and sent in reinforcements to restore order. Aid has begun to arrive, including a US aircraft carrier, the USS George Washington, which is providing search-and-rescue operations and supplies.

The Republicans' agenda includes repealing the Affordable Care Act, a tax overhaul, and the reversal of Obama-era environmental regulations. The Senate will be the site of most contention over the GOP's agenda, as Democrats have the procedural tools to fight back. The House is expected to reelect Speaker Paul Ryan, and the Senate will swiftly begin vetting Trump's cabinet picks. Trump's often shifting views on major issues will test relations with GOP leaders on Capitol Hill, and his willingness to skirt ideological rigidity gives incoming Senate Democratic leader Charles Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi an opening to influence and shape the president's evolving agenda. The Republicans will also move quickly to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but may delay the repeal measure's effective date for years. The Senate must also consider Trump's cabinet picks, and Senate Democrats are already trying to slow the process. The Congressional Review Act will be used to undo new regulations, and the Republicans will target rules that require oil and gas producers to reduce methane gases, mining and fossil fuel companies to disclose payments to foreign governments, and restrictions on pesticide use. The party's leaders are aware of the punishment that Americans have historically delivered in midterm elections when things have not gone well, and are urging caution.

The finding suggests the planet contains a lot more ice and a lot less rock than thought, the Christian Science Monitor reports. There are still a lot of mysteries to be solved. Scientists hope the first close-up look at Pluto's surface will explain features like heart- and doughnut-shaped features recently spotted for the first time.

The composition is designed to be used as a dentifrice in a thorough oral hygiene program, and has been shown to be effective in reducing the severity of gingivitis and periodontitis. The method involves applying the composition to the gingivae daily, and has been found to increase the rate of healing of gingivitis. The composition is packaged in a toothpaste tube, with the SRF separated from the other active ingredients until the time of use. The formulation of the toothpaste is as follows: glycerine, carboxymethylcellulose, sorbitol, zinc chloride, sodium benzoate, sodium saccharine, sodium fluoride, sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, Syloid B-30, Sicosil 63M, titanium dioxide, and sodium lauryl sulfate.

Despite the dueling headlines, climate change is not the central issue in stories about extreme storms like Harvey and Irma. However, climate change is a threat multiplier, making storms worse. The storms, challenges of emergency response, and consequences of poor adaptation all predate climate change, but climate change will steadily make them worse. Climate change does not cause storms, but it raises the probability of tripping and falling, or raises the average severity of tripping and falling. Increased heat energy is a causal condition in every storm, but it is not the primary causal agent in any storm. Climate change made Harvey and Irma worse in two ways: it raised sea levels more than half a foot in recent decades, and it raised the temperature of the water in the region, leading to more evaporation and more water in the air. The combination of coastal flooding and heavy rainfall is responsible for the devastating flooding in Houston. Climate change worsened the impact of Hurricane Harvey. The recent Category 4 hurricanes making landfall in the US have revived the perennial discussion about the relationship between extreme storms and climate change. The scientific consensus is that climate change is increasing the odds that storms will be more powerful and destructive. The dominant scientific consensus is that climate change is increasing the severity of disasters such as Hurricane Harvey. Warmer ocean waters are more conducive to more intense hurricanes, and warmer air holds more moisture. Climate change is warming both the ocean and the air, leading to higher sea levels and more intense storms. The combination of coastal flooding and heavy rainfall is responsible for the devastating flooding in Houston. The relationship between climate change and extreme storms is a complex issue, but climate change is a threat multiplier, making storms worse. The storms, challenges of emergency response, and consequences of poor adaptation all predate climate change, but climate change will steadily make them worse.

As with most debates on climate change—particularly when talking about a single weather event—the views are all over the map. And some are suggesting that we need to frame the question differently to get the most accurate response. The details: Wrong question: Did climate change cause Harvey? That's not the right question, writes Dino Grandoni at the Washington Post. \"The better way to frame thinking about the connection is through the question: Does climate change make storms like Harvey more likely?\" This is a theme repeated in multiple posts on the subject, and Grandoni thinks the answer is yes, for reasons spelled out below. 'Worsened': One of the most cited pieces is from Penn State professor Michael Mann in the Guardian. \"We can't say that Hurricane Harvey was caused by climate change,\" he writes. \"But it was certainly worsened by it.\" The three big factors: Higher ocean levels made the storm surge worse, warmer water made the storm more intense, and Harvey stayed \"locked in place\" thanks to atmospheric changes brought on by humans. (The latter was the subject of a paper by Mann.) Maybe 'slightly': University of Washington atmospheric scientist Cliff Mass is skeptical the link is that strong. \"You really can't pin global warming on something this extreme,\" he tells Fox News. \"It has to be natural variability. It may juice it up slightly but not create this phenomenal anomaly.\" Link is 'unknown': Texas State climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon thinks it's too early to assess any link. \"The climate change impact on the strength of Harvey is unknown,\" he writes to CNN. \"Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the strongest storms, but it's not clear whether Harvey was in that category.\" Still, he notes that heavier rain in general is a \"direct consequence\" of climate change, and Harvey certainly fits that pattern. Too 'fussy': David Leonhardt at the New York Times thinks \"it's time to shed some of the fussy over-precision about the relationship between climate change and weather.\" The evidence is overwhelming that human-caused climate change results in storms such as Harvey, he writes, and our timidness in admitting it is holding up solutions. All about the rain: The jury is out on whether climate change increases the frequency of hurricanes, writes David Roberts in a wide-ranging Q&A at Vox. But he, too, says it's clear that heavier rain is an undisputed consequence. \"In fact, due to sea level rise and more moisture in the air, I expect flooding to be the most frequent public face of climate change over the next decade or so.\" Media coverage: You won't hear much about climate change in the current news coverage because reporters don't want to \"politicize\" the situation, writes Naomi Klein at the Intercept. \"But here's the thing: Every time we act as if an unprecedented weather event is hitting us out of the blue, as some sort of Act of God that no one foresaw, reporters are making a highly political decision,\" she notes. In contrast, panelists on Fox's The Five spotted a CNN banner mentioning climate change and accused the network of pushing a liberal agenda. \"It's called the weather,\" said co-host Jesse Watters."], "length": 27520}

The plane's disappearance was a sharp westward turn during a 10-minute leg of the flight between Malaysian and Vietnamese airspace, where there is little primary radar coverage. The flight zigzagged off course, rose to 45,000 feet, well above the approved altitude for a Boeing 777, possibly to ensure that passengers could not use their cellphones or to incapacitate them by causing a shortage of oxygen. The search operation has been extensive, with nearly a dozen Indian ships, patrol vessels, surveillance aircraft, and helicopters scoured the region. However, no sighting or detection has been reported by the units deployed for searches in various designated areas. The disappearance of the plane has raised concerns about pilot mental health and the need for better screening and support for pilots.

The GOP's agenda includes repealing the Affordable Care Act, cutting taxes, and rolling back environmental regulations. Republicans have long sought to gut the health care law, which they blame for a lackluster economic recovery. Democrats will try to block the GOP's agenda by swaying public opinion and using the power they have in the Senate to filibuster legislation. The Senate will be the site of most contention over the GOP's agenda, with Democrats holding the procedural tools to fight back. Republicans will hold 52 seats to Democrats' 46, with Vice President-elect Mike Pence as the tie-breaker. The House is expected to reelect Speaker Paul Ryan, with all the campaign-season recriminations involving the Wisconsin Republican and Trump largely erased by GOP wins. The GOP will hold a hefty 241-194 majority in the House, including 52 freshmen. The Senate will exercise its advice and consent role and consider nominations of 15 department secretaries and six people tapped by Trump to lead agencies or serve in roles with Cabinet-level status. The first public hearing on the intelligence community's assessment that Russia interfered in the US election is Thursday in the Senate Armed Services Committee. Republicans are also expected to punish Democrats for last year's gun control sit-in, led by civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), by imposing new rules that would slap up to $2,500 fines on lawmakers who film such floor protests from smartphones or other devices. The GOP's top promise — to end Obamacare — remains a tough haul, with votes expected in coming days on legislation to begin repealing the Affordable Care Act. Republicans are also likely to postpone fully dismantling the healthcare law until they can sort out their own ideas for a yet-to-be-determined alternative.

However, a joint investigation by the Boulder Daily Camera and 9NEWS has found that the DNA evidence does not support a pivotal development in the case, a former Boulder prosecutor's decision to clear the Ramsey family from all suspicion. Forensic experts who examined the results of DNA tests obtained exclusively by the two news organizations disputed former District Attorney Mary Lacy's conclusion that a DNA profile found in one place on JonBenet's underpants and two locations on her long johns was necessarily the killer's. The experts found that the DNA samples recovered from the long johns came from at least two people in addition to JonBenet, and that the DNA profile referred to as Unknown Male 1 may not be the DNA of a single person at all, but rather a composite of genetic material from multiple individuals. The presence of a third person's genetic markers has never before been publicly revealed. The experts also raised the possibility that the original DNA sample recovered from JonBenet's underwear could be a composite and not that of a single individual. The findings could cut both ways, and do not implicate or exonerate anyone in the family. The case is currently cold, but Boulder police say they are continuing to investigate any lead that comes in. The implications of the conclusions reached by the experts could dramatically impact the future direction of the investigation. The experts' findings have been met with skepticism by some, including Ramsey lawyer Lin Wood, who has expressed confidence in Lacy's integrity and believes that the case is a DNA case. However, the experts' conclusions have also been supported by other experts, including Phillip Danielson, a professor of molecular biology at the University of Denver. Danielson noted that the DNA profile could easily be a composite profile, and that the link between the two spots on the long johns and the DNA in the underwear is tenuous at best.

In a statement, Kushner denied any wrongdoing, stating that he did not collude with Russia and had no improper contacts. However, a close read of the statement suggests that it does not put the matter to rest, as it raises new questions about Kushner's links to the Kremlin. Kushner's statement reveals that he met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak on December 1, 2016, and discussed setting up a secure communications line between the Trump camp and Russia.

Forage fish are crucial for the marine ecosystem, and their decline raises concerns about the potential for fishing pressure to shift to similar species.

One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same.
