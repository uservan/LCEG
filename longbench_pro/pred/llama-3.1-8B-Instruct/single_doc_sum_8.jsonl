The Coast Guard is responsible for 11 statutory missions, including marine safety, and has developed goals and targets to assess its performance. However, the Coast Guard faces challenges in collecting and using data to inform its decision-making, including incomplete data on commercial fishing vessel safety and unrealistic asset performance data. The Coast Guard has begun acquiring new vessels, but concerns surround the affordability of this effort. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has recommended that the Coast Guard improve the completeness of its mission data, use more realistic asset performance data, and improve the transparency of its data on mission performance. The Coast Guard has agreed to address these recommendations, but further action is needed to fully implement them. The GAO has also recommended that the Coast Guard develop a 20-year plan to identify necessary recapitalization efforts and fiscal resources, but the Coast Guard has not stated when this plan will be completed. Overall, the Coast Guard faces challenges in managing its resources and data to effectively carry out its missions. The GAO's recommendations aim to improve the Coast Guard's performance and transparency, but further action is needed to address these challenges. The Coast Guard's efforts to modernize its assets and improve its data collection and use are ongoing, but the affordability of these efforts remains a concern. The GAO will continue to monitor the Coast Guard's progress in addressing these challenges. The Coast Guard's performance assessment process includes identifying performance gaps and implementing corrective actions to address unmet performance goals. The Coast Guard has established targets for the current and subsequent 2 fiscal years, but some targets are derived from external factors. The Coast Guard's performance data is not always reliable, and the agency has not always reported the limitations of its data. The GAO has recommended that the Coast Guard assess the extent to which its documentation on performance data reliability contains appropriate information on known data reliability limitations and update these documents as needed. The Coast Guard has agreed to address this recommendation, but further action is needed to fully implement it. The GAO has also recommended that the Coast Guard make its Annual Performance Report (APR) publicly available, but the Coast Guard has not yet done so. The lack of transparency regarding performance data shared publicly and with Congress can result in an incomplete picture of mission performance and limit effective oversight of Coast Guard operations. The GAO's recommendations aim to improve the Coast Guard's transparency and accountability, but further action is needed to address", "answers": ["The Coast Guard, a component of DHS, serves as the principal federal agency responsible for maritime safety, security, and environmental stewardship in U.S. ports and waterways. To ensure that the Coast Guard is effectively fulfilling its missions, agency managers must have accurate information and base decisions on sound analyses for effective program management. This statement discusses Coast Guard actions needed to (1) improve the quality of data used for program management and (2) improve the transparency of its data for reporting on mission performance and planning. This statement is based on relevant products GAO issued from June 2014 through December 2017 on Coast Guard strategic planning and management issues, as well as related recommendation follow-up conducted through February 2018. GAO reviewed applicable laws, regulations, policies and guidance. GAO also interviewed Coast Guard officials responsible for administering these programs and obtained information on how they used data to inform decisionmaking. GAO interviewed a range of stakeholders, including federal and industry officials. GAO's prior work recommended multiple actions to improve the Coast Guard's program management by improving the quality of data it uses to manage and report on its mission performance. Specifically, GAO recommended actions such as collecting more complete data and clarifying the data limitations to facilitate more effective program management. For example, in December 2017, GAO found that more information is needed to calculate vessel safety statistics that could enhance the Coast Guard's knowledge about accident, injury, and fatality trends involving commercial fishing vessels. Having more complete information could be useful to carrying out its marine safety mission, and GAO recommended, among other things, that the Coast Guard ensure that data collected during commercial fishing vessel incident investigations is accurately captured. In 2018, the Coast Guard reported taking initial steps to capture more accurate data. GAO's prior work also identified areas where the Coast Guard could improve the transparency of the data it uses for reporting on its mission performance as well its capital planning purposes. For example, in an October 2017 report on performance goals, GAO found the Coast Guard's Annual Performance Report (APR) has not been released publicly since 2011. Consequently, there has not been full visibility over performance across all of the Coast Guard's missions. Coast Guard officials stated that a decision by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) leadership to limit the number of performance goals shared publicly had deterred the Coast Guard from public release of its APR. GAO recommended that APRs be available on the Coast Guard's website; the Coast Guard plans to publicly release future APRs. In addition, previous GAO reports found that the Coast Guard's annual 5-year capital investment plan, which projects acquisition funding needs for the upcoming 5 years, did not consistently reflect current total cost estimates or the effects of tradeoffs made as part of the annual budget cycle. GAO made recommendations to help the Coast Guard plan for future acquisitions and the difficult trade off decisions it will face given funding constraints. The Coast Guard agreed, but it is unclear when it will complete the 20-year plan. GAO is not making new recommendations in this statement but has made them to the Coast Guard and DHS in the past on improving its program management through, among other things, better quality and more transparent data.

As of April 2017, only about 2.5% of eligible entities had registered to use disposal bins to collect unused prescription drugs. The main reasons for low participation rates include the associated costs of purchasing, installing, and managing the disposal bins, uncertainty over proper implementation, and participation in other, similar efforts for disposing of unused prescription drugs. The DEA provides guidance on the disposal of prescription drugs, but stakeholders have raised concerns that the agency's regulations may conflict with other state and federal requirements governing the transportation and disposal of hazardous waste. The availability of disposal options at law enforcement agencies contributes to the low participation rates among pharmacies as authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs. About half of the country's population lived less than 5 miles away from a pharmacy or other DEA-authorized entity offering a prescription disposal bin as of April 2017. The DEA's website contains a public search feature to identify authorized collectors located near a specific zip code or address. Authorized collectors must install, manage, and maintain the disposal bins following DEA regulations, which include requirements for the disposal bin's design, location, and operation. The DEA does not collect information on the extent to which the bins are used or the amount and types of prescription drugs deposited into the bins due to concerns about minimizing the risk of diversion. The agency views its responsibility solely as giving pharmacies and other eligible entities the opportunity to become authorized collectors. External funding is available to some authorized collectors to pay for the costs associated with installing and maintaining the disposal bins. The state of North Dakota has the highest participation rate, with 32.0% of its pharmacies and other eligible entities registered to be authorized collectors.

About half of the people who reported misusing prescription drugs in 2015 received them from a friend or relative. One way to help prevent this kind of diversion and potential misuse is by providing secure and convenient ways to dispose of unused, unneeded, or expired prescription medications. The Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010 authorizes pharmacies and other entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances to also collect unused prescription drugs for disposal. In 2014, DEA finalized regulations for the implementation of the Act, establishing a voluntary process for eligible entities to become authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs using disposal bins. GAO was asked to review participation among authorized collectors that maintain disposal bins. In this report GAO describes (1) participation rates among entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs and (2) factors that affect participation. GAO analyzed the most currently available DEA data from April 2017 on entities eligible to participate and those participating as authorized collectors. GAO also conducted interviews with DEA officials and a nongeneralizable sample of 11 stakeholder organizations selected to illustrate different types of authorized collectors and long-term care facilities. GAO is not making any recommendations. DEA provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. GAO found that about 3 percent of pharmacies and other entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs for disposal have volunteered to do so. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) authorizes these entities to dispose of unused drugs to help reduce their potential misuse. Analysis of DEA data shows that as of April 2017, 2,233 of the 89,550 (2.49 percent) eligible entities—that is, certain entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances—had registered with DEA to use disposal bins to collect unused prescription drugs. Most—about 81 percent—of the authorized collectors were pharmacies, followed by hospitals or clinics. GAO also found that participation rates varied by state, though in 44 states less than 5 percent of the state's pharmacies and other eligible entities had registered to become authorized collectors. Stakeholders cited several factors that may explain why relatively few pharmacies and other eligible entities have registered with DEA as authorized collectors of unused drugs. Most notably, stakeholders representing authorized collectors told GAO that because participation is voluntary, the cost associated with maintaining a disposal bin—which includes purchasing and installing the bin according to DEA requirements and paying for the destruction of its contents—is an important factor to weigh against potential benefits. DEA noted that availability of disposal by law enforcement agencies also contributes to low participation."], "length": 6560}

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (VAMC) officials are responsible for reviewing the clinical care delivered by their privileged providers—physicians and dentists who are approved to independently perform specific services—after concerns are raised. The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care. For example, GAO found that after one VAMC failed to report to the NPDB or SLBs a provider who resigned to avoid an adverse privileging action, a non-VA hospital in the same city took an adverse privileging action against that same provider for the same reason 2 years later."], "length": 5614}

This decentralization can affect how well federal action on election administration serves its intended purposes. Congress has a number of tools for influencing election administration policy, including requiring or encouraging changes to the way state and local election systems work. The report aims to help Congress understand how state and local election systems work and how their workings might relate to federal activity on election administration. The typical federal election process has three main parts: voter registration, vote casting, and vote counting. States generally play the primary decisionmaking role in election administration, with state legislatures and governors making laws and amendments to state constitutions. Localities typically assume primary responsibility for the day-to-day implementation of election administration policy, including adding eligible voters to the voter rolls, designing and printing ballots, and counting election results. The federal government does not supply ongoing funding to states and localities to conduct elections, with the exception of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA), which authorized $3.65 billion for state and local election administration. States and localities are responsible for most of the costs of conducting federal elections, with localities typically assuming primary responsibility for those costs. The structures of state and local election systems vary, including differences related to leadership, relationship between local election officials and the state, and population size and density of the jurisdiction served by the system. The duties and structures of state and local election systems can affect the implementation of federal election administration laws, and Congress has specified how states and localities should distribute certain election administration duties and structure certain elements of their election systems. Changes to the duties and structures of state and local election systems have sometimes been side effects of other federal activity on election administration. \n\nThe report highlights the importance of understanding how state and local election systems work and how their workings might relate to federal activity on election administration.

Elections are primarily administered by thousands of state and local systems rather than a single, unified national system. States and localities share responsibility for most election administration duties. Exactly how responsibilities are assigned at the state and local levels varies both between and within states, but there are some general patterns in the distribution of duties. States typically have primary responsibility for making decisions about the rules of elections (policymaking). Localities typically have primary responsibility for conducting elections in accordance with those rules (implementation). Localities, with varying contributions from states, typically also have primary responsibility for paying for the activities and resources required to conduct elections (funding). The structures of the state and local systems that conduct elections also vary between and within states. Common variations include differences related to the leadership of the system, the relationship between local election officials and the state, and the population size and density of the jurisdiction the system serves. The leadership of a state or local election system may be elected or appointed, and both the leaders and the methods used to select them may be partisan, bipartisan, or nonpartisan. State officials may have more or less direct influence over local election officials, and the extent of their influence may be affected by other structural features of the state's election systems, such as the methods used to select local officials. Finally, larger election jurisdictions have different administrative advantages and challenges than smaller ones, and more urban jurisdictions have different advantages and challenges than more rural ones. These differences between jurisdictions may be reflected in structural features of the election systems that serve them, such as how the systems allocate resources and where they find specialized expertise. Understanding the duties and structures of state and local election systems may be relevant to Congress for at least two reasons. First, the way state and local election systems work can affect how well federal action on election administration serves its intended purposes. The effectiveness of federal action depends in part on how it is implemented. How it is implemented can depend, in turn, on how the state and local election systems that implement it work. Second, Congress can make or incentivize changes to the way state and local election systems work. Congress has a number of policy tools it can use to affect the administration of federal elections.

The Resolute Support mission aims to establish self-sustaining Afghan security ministries and forces that can maintain security in Afghanistan. However, the security environment in Afghanistan has deteriorated since 2015, with nearly 24,000 security incidents reported in 2017. The US contributes 54% of Resolute Support military personnel and provides $4.67 billion for the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund in 2018.

House Report 114-537 included a provision for GAO to review the ANDSF's capability and capacity to operate and sustain U.S.-purchased weapon systems and equipment. This report addresses (1) what has been reported about ANDSF capabilities and capability gaps and (2) the extent to which DOD has information about the ANDSF's ability to operate and maintain U.S.-purchased equipment. To conduct this work, GAO analyzed DOD and NATO reports and documents, examined three critical equipment types, and interviewed DOD officials in the United States and Afghanistan. This is a public version of a sensitive report issued in September 2018. Information that DOD deemed sensitive has been omitted. Since the Resolute Support mission began in 2015, the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) have improved some fundamental capabilities, such as high-level operational planning, but continue to rely on U.S. and coalition support to fill several key capability gaps, according to Department of Defense (DOD) reporting. DOD has initiatives to address some ANDSF capability gaps, such as a country-wide vehicle maintenance and training effort, but DOD reports it does not expect the ANDSF to develop and sustain independent capabilities in some areas, such as logistics, for several years. While DOD has firsthand information on the abilities of the Afghan Air Force and Special Security Forces to operate and maintain U.S.-purchased equipment, it has little reliable information on the equipment proficiency of conventional ANDSF units. U.S. and coalition advisors are embedded at the tactical level for the Air Force and Special Security Forces, enabling DOD to directly assess those forces' abilities. However, the advisors have little direct contact with conventional ANDSF units on the front lines. As a result, DOD relies on those units' self-assessments of tactical abilities, which, according to DOD officials, can be unreliable. GAO's analysis of three critical equipment types illustrated the varying degrees of DOD's information (see figure above). For example, DOD provided detailed information about the Air Force's ability to operate and maintain MD-530 helicopters and the Special Security Forces' ability to operate and maintain Mobile Strike Force Vehicles; however, DOD had limited information about how conventional forces operate and maintain radios and Mobile Strike Force Vehicles. DOD's lack of reliable information on conventional forces' equipment operations and maintenance abilities adds to the uncertainty and risk in assessing the progress of DOD efforts in Afghanistan.

{"pred": " \nThe passage discusses the effects of low-dose radiation on human health. According to the National Academies, the risk of cancer increases with every incremental increase in radiation exposure, following the linear no-threshold model. However, there is uncertainty about the extent to which health effects from non-U.S. populations, such as Japanese atomic bomb survivors, can be extrapolated to a U.S. population. The passage also discusses the funding for research on the health effects of low-dose radiation, with the Department of Energy (DOE) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) accounting for most of the funding. The passage concludes that further research is needed to decrease uncertainty in predicting cancer risk from low-dose radiation and recommends that the Secretary of Energy lead the development of a mechanism for interagency collaboration to address overall research priorities related to low-dose radiation health effects. The passage also notes that the DOE did not agree with this recommendation, citing its legal mandates and budget authorities. However, the passage argues that an interagency coordination mechanism is still needed and that DOE is in the best position to lead agencies in developing the most appropriate mechanism.  The passage also mentions that the GAO has recommended that the Secretary of Energy lead the development of a mechanism for interagency collaboration to determine roles and responsibilities for addressing priorities related to research on the health effects of low-dose radiation.  The passage concludes by stating that the GAO believes that an interagency coordination mechanism for low-dose research is needed and that DOE is in the best position to lead agencies in developing the most appropriate mechanism.

The Department of Energy (DOE), Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Food and Drug Administration generally used the advice of scientific advisory bodies to develop and apply radiation protection requirements and guidance for workers and the public in the radiation exposure settings that GAO reviewed. These settings were: (1) the operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants; (2) the cleanup of sites with radiological contamination; (3) the use of medical equipment that produces radiation; and (4) accidental or terrorism-related exposure to radiation. Specifically, the agencies relied on the advice of three scientific advisory bodies that supported the use of a model that assumes the risk of cancer increases with every incremental radiation exposure. Accordingly, the agencies have set regulatory dose limits and issued guidance to confine exposure to levels that reduce the risk of cancer, while recognizing that scientific uncertainties occur in estimating cancer risks from low-dose radiation. For example, NRC requires nuclear power plants to consider measures for limiting workers' exposure below NRC's regulatory dose limit, such as by using robots for maintenance work in radiation areas. GAO identified seven federal agencies that funded research on low-dose radiation's health effects. In fiscal years 2012 to 2016, DOE, NRC, EPA, and four other federal agencies obligated about $210 million for such research . Although the agencies have collaborated on individual projects on radiation's health effects, they have not established a collaborative mechanism to set research priorities. GAO's previous work has shown that federal agencies can use such mechanisms to implement interagency collaboration to develop and coordinate sound science policies. In the past, DOE took a leading role in this area because DOE provided stable funding and advocated for greater coordination on research on low-dose radiation's health effects. However, since fiscal year 2012, DOE has phased out funding for one of its main research programs in this area. This has created a void in coordination efforts among federal agencies, and no other agency has stepped forward to fill this void. Because of DOE's prior experience as a leader in this area of research and its research responsibility under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, it could play an important role in helping federal agencies establish a coordinating mechanism for low-dose radiation research.

Israeli domestic political issues, including elections scheduled for 2019. Israel relies on a number of strengths to manage potential threats to its security and existence. It maintains conventional military superiority relative to neighboring states and the Palestinians. It also takes measures to deter attack and defend its population and borders from evolving asymmetric threats such as rockets and missiles, cross-border tunneling, drones, and cyberattacks. Additionally, Israel has an undeclared but presumed nuclear weapons capability. Against a backdrop of strong bilateral cooperation, Israel's leaders and supporters routinely make the case that Israel's security and the broader stability of the region remain critically important for U.S. interests. A 10-year bilateral military aid memorandum of understanding (MOU)—signed in 2016—commits the United States to provide Israel $3.3 billion in Foreign Military Financing annually from FY2019 to FY2028, along with additional amounts from Defense Department accounts for missile defense. All of these amounts remain subject to congressional appropriations. Israeli officials seek to counter Iranian regional influence and prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu released new Israeli intelligence on Iran's nuclear program in April 2018, days before President Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 international agreement that constrains Iran's nuclear activities. It is unclear whether Israel might take future military action in Iran if Iranian nuclear activities resume. Since 2018, Israel has conducted a number of military operations in Syria against Iran and its allies, including Lebanese Hezbollah. Israel and Iran also appear to be competing for military advantage over each other at the Israel-Lebanon border. Amid uncertainty in the area, in March 2019 President Trump recognized Israel's claim to sovereignty over the Golan Heights, changing long-standing U.S. policy that held—in line with U.N. Security Council Resolution 497 from 1981—the Golan was occupied Syrian territory whose final status was subject to Israel-Syria negotiation. The prospects for an Israeli-Palestinian peace process are complicated by many factors. Palestinian leaders cut off high-level political contacts with the Trump Administration after it recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital in December 2017. U.S.-Palestinian tensions have since worsened amid U.S. cutoffs of funding to the Palestinians and diplomatic moves—including the May 2018 opening of the U.S. embassy to Israel in Jerusalem. Palestinian leaders interpreted these actions as prejudicing their claims to a capital in Jerusalem and to a just resolution of Palestinian refugee claims. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has welcomed these U.S. actions. The Trump Administration has suggested that it will release a proposed peace plan after Israeli elections, which are scheduled for April 9, 2019. Speculation continues about how warming ties between Israel and Arab Gulf states may affect Israeli-Palestinian diplomacy, though Saudi Arabia said that the U.S. policy change on the Golan Heights would negatively affect the peace process.

The GAO's review also highlights the need for OMB to provide clearer guidance on how agencies should test to identify improper payments and how they should treat nonresponse cases. The GAO's recommendations are intended to improve the quality of improper payment estimates and ensure that agencies address key risks in their programs. The GAO's report is a critical assessment of the federal government's improper payment estimation processes and provides recommendations for improvement. The GAO's", "answers": ["Improper payments—which include payments that should not have been made or were made in an incorrect amount—are a long-standing, significant problem in the federal government, estimated at almost $141 billion for fiscal year 2017. Executive branch agencies are required to annually estimate improper payments for certain programs. Estimation of improper payments is key to understanding the extent of the problem and to developing effective corrective actions. Relevant laws and guidance provide agencies flexibility in developing estimates. This report describes agencies' processes to estimate improper payments in selected programs for fiscal year 2017 and the extent to which certain differences in these processes can affect the usefulness of the resulting estimates. GAO selected 10 programs across six agencies with the largest reported program outlays in fiscal years 2015 and 2016. For these programs, GAO reviewed relevant laws and guidance, analyzed agencies' policies and procedures, and interviewed officials at relevant agencies and OMB staff. The six agencies GAO reviewed reported taking various approaches related to key components of estimating improper payments—shown in the figure below—for 10 selected programs, which collectively reported outlays of over $2.5 trillion for fiscal year 2017. Sample selection. Eight of the 10 programs GAO reviewed reported using statistically valid approaches, and the remaining 2 reported using alternative methodologies approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The sampled data elements varied, including payments, medical claims, and tax returns. The age of the data used to develop fiscal year 2017 improper payment estimates also varied, ranging from calendar year 2013 to fiscal year 2017. Identification of improper payments. Some of the six agencies reported using processes designed specifically to estimate improper payments, whereas others reported leveraging existing reviews. These agencies' policies and procedures include a review of aspects of eligibility, except for those related to the Department of Defense's (DOD) Military Pay and the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) Retirement overpayments. DOD and OPM have not fully assessed whether their estimation processes effectively consider key program risks. OMB guidance does not specifically address how agencies are to test to identify improper payments, such as using a risk-based approach to help ensure that key risks of improper payments are addressed. The six agencies also varied in the treatment of insufficient documentation, both in identifying and in reporting the root causes of improper payments. For the agencies that contact entities outside the agency to estimate improper payments, the treatment of nonresponse differed, with one agency including nonresponses as improper payments and another generally excluding the nonresponse cases from review. Although OMB guidance states that agencies should treat cases of insufficient documentation as improper payments, it does not specifically address the treatment of nonresponse cases. Calculation of the improper payment estimate. The six agencies generally reported using law and OMB guidance to calculate improper payment estimates for the selected programs, except for the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) removed overpayments that were recovered when developing its estimate. OMB guidance requires agencies to include recovered amounts in their estimates. Removing these overpayments understates the EITC improper payment estimate and may limit IRS's ability to develop corrective actions to prevent improper payments. GAO recommends that OMB develop guidance on treatment of nonresponse cases and testing to identify improper payments, that DOD and OPM assess their estimation processes, and that IRS revise its methodology to not exclude recovered payments from its estimate. All of the agencies either agreed or partially agreed with the specific recommendations to them. GAO believes that the actions are warranted, as discussed in the report."], "length": 5169}

{"pred": " Passage 1\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) regulates the disposal of controlled substances through its disposal bin program. The program allows pharmacies and other eligible entities to collect unused prescription drugs and dispose of them in a safe and secure manner. However, the program has seen low participation rates, with only about 2.5% of eligible entities registered to use disposal bins as of April 2017. The main reasons for low participation rates include the associated costs of purchasing, installing, and managing the disposal bins, uncertainty over proper implementation, and participation in other, similar efforts for disposing of unused prescription drugs. The DEA has provided guidance and support to authorized collectors, but stakeholders have raised concerns about the agency's communication and guidance. The DEA has also faced challenges in collecting data on the use of disposal bins, including the extent to which the bins are used and the amount and types of prescription drugs deposited into the bins. Overall, the DEA's disposal bin program has the potential to improve public health and safety, but its low participation rates and challenges in implementation hinder its effectiveness. Key evidence presented includes data on the number of authorized collectors and their locations, as well as stakeholder feedback on the costs and challenges associated with participating in the program. Unique points made in the passage include the DEA's non-retrievable standard for destruction of the inner liners of the disposal bins and the use of swap exchanges as an alternative funding mechanism for federal real property projects.

The passage notes that", "answers": ["In 2015, 3.8 million Americans reported misusing prescription drugs within the last month, and deaths from prescription opioids have more than quadrupled since 1999. About half of the people who reported misusing prescription drugs in 2015 received them from a friend or relative. One way to help prevent this kind of diversion and potential misuse is by providing secure and convenient ways to dispose of unused, unneeded, or expired prescription medications. The Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010 authorizes pharmacies and other entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances to also collect unused prescription drugs for disposal. In 2014, DEA finalized regulations for the implementation of the Act, establishing a voluntary process for eligible entities to become authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs using disposal bins. GAO was asked to review participation among authorized collectors that maintain disposal bins. In this report GAO describes (1) participation rates among entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs and (2) factors that affect participation. GAO analyzed the most currently available DEA data from April 2017 on entities eligible to participate and those participating as authorized collectors. GAO also conducted interviews with DEA officials and a nongeneralizable sample of 11 stakeholder organizations selected to illustrate different types of authorized collectors and long-term care facilities. GAO is not making any recommendations. DEA provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. GAO found that about 3 percent of pharmacies and other entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs for disposal have volunteered to do so. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) authorizes these entities to dispose of unused drugs to help reduce their potential misuse. Analysis of DEA data shows that as of April 2017, 2,233 of the 89,550 (2.49 percent) eligible entities—that is, certain entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances—had registered with DEA to use disposal bins to collect unused prescription drugs. Most—about 81 percent—of the authorized collectors were pharmacies, followed by hospitals or clinics. GAO also found that participation rates varied by state, though in 44 states less than 5 percent of the state's pharmacies and other eligible entities had registered to become authorized collectors. Stakeholders cited several factors that may explain why relatively few pharmacies and other eligible entities have registered with DEA as authorized collectors of unused drugs. Most notably, stakeholders representing authorized collectors told GAO that because participation is voluntary, the cost associated with maintaining a disposal bin—which includes purchasing and installing the bin according to DEA requirements and paying for the destruction of its contents—is an important factor to weigh against potential benefits. DEA noted that availability of disposal by law enforcement agencies also contributes to low participation."], "length": 6379}

{"pred": " Passage 2\nThe National Academy of Sciences has concluded that the risk of cancer increases with every incremental increase in radiation exposure, using the linear no-threshold model. However, there is uncertainty about the extent to which the health effects for populations exposed to acute radiation can be extrapolated to populations exposed to low-dose radiation. The National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements and the International Commission on Radiological Protection have recommended that doses should be kept as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) have set dose limits for radiation exposure, but these limits are below the level considered low dose by the National Academy of Sciences. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has funded research on the health effects of low-dose radiation, including epidemiological and radiobiological studies. However, the funding for this research has decreased over the past five years, and the agencies have not used a collaborative mechanism to address overall research priorities. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has recommended that the Secretary of Energy lead the development of a mechanism for interagency collaboration to determine roles and responsibilities for addressing priorities related to research on the health effects of low-dose radiation. The GAO believes that such a mechanism would help to reduce uncertainty in predicting cancer risk from low-dose radiation and would be beneficial for the federal agencies involved. However, the Department of Energy (DOE) has not agreed with this recommendation, citing the legal mandates and budget authorities of other agencies. The GAO continues to believe that an interagency coordination mechanism for low-dose research is needed and that DOE is in the best position to lead agencies in developing the most appropriate mechanism.

The Department of Energy (DOE), Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Food and Drug Administration generally used the advice of scientific advisory bodies to develop and apply radiation protection requirements and guidance for workers and the public in the radiation exposure settings that GAO reviewed. These settings were: (1) the operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants; (2) the cleanup of sites with radiological contamination; (3) the use of medical equipment that produces radiation; and (4) accidental or terrorism-related exposure to radiation. Specifically, the agencies relied on the advice of three scientific advisory bodies that supported the use of a model that assumes the risk of cancer increases with every incremental radiation exposure. Accordingly, the agencies have set regulatory dose limits and issued guidance to confine exposure to levels that reduce the risk of cancer, while recognizing that scientific uncertainties occur in estimating cancer risks from low-dose radiation. For example, NRC requires nuclear power plants to consider measures for limiting workers' exposure below NRC's regulatory dose limit, such as by using robots for maintenance work in radiation areas. GAO identified seven federal agencies that funded research on low-dose radiation's health effects. In fiscal years 2012 to 2016, DOE, NRC, EPA, and four other federal agencies obligated about $210 million for such research . Although the agencies have collaborated on individual projects on radiation's health effects, they have not established a collaborative mechanism to set research priorities. GAO's previous work has shown that federal agencies can use such mechanisms to implement interagency collaboration to develop and coordinate sound science policies. In the past, DOE took a leading role in this area because DOE provided stable funding and advocated for greater coordination on research on low-dose radiation's health effects. However, since fiscal year 2012, DOE has phased out funding for one of its main research programs in this area. This has created a void in coordination efforts among federal agencies, and no other agency has stepped forward to fill this void. Because of DOE's prior experience as a leader in this area of research and its research responsibility under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, it could play an important role in helping federal agencies establish a coordinating mechanism for low-dose radiation research.

DOD has repeatedly applied the BRAC process to reduce the amount of unneeded property that it owns and leases and to save billions of dollars that could be applied to higher priority defense needs. This statement is based on GAO's April 2017 report related to VA facility alignment ( GAO-17-349 ) and numerous GAO reports related to the BRAC process as summarized in a June 2011 testimony ( GAO-11-704T ) and a March 2012 testimony ( GAO-12-513T ). This statement addresses (1) the factors that affect VA's facility alignment and the extent to which VA's capital-planning process facilitates the alignment of facilities with the veterans' population, and (2) the key elements and challenges affecting DOD and the Commission in BRAC 2005. Detailed information on our scope and methodologies for this work can be found in these published products, cited throughout this testimony. Geographic shifts in the veterans' population, changes in health care delivery, aging infrastructure, and limited stakeholder involvement affect the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) efforts to align its services and real property portfolio to meet the needs of veterans. For example, a shift over time from inpatient to outpatient care will likely result in underutilized space once used for inpatient care. Further, the historic status of some VA facilities adds to the complexity of converting or disposing of them. In such instances, it is often difficult and costly for VA to modernize, renovate, and retrofit these older facilities. GAO reported that two of the planning processes VA uses to align its facilities—VA's Strategic Capital Investment Planning (SCIP) and the VA Integrated Planning (VAIP)—have limitations that undermine VA's efforts to achieve its goals. Specifically: VA relies on the SCIP process to plan and prioritize capital projects, but VA routinely asks its facility planners to submit their next year's planned project narratives before knowing if their previous submissions have been funded. The overlapping budget cycle, which is outside of VA's control, combined with other SCIP limitations—including subjective narratives, long time frames, and restricted access to information—make it difficult for VA to rely on SCIP to accurately identify the capital necessary to address its service and infrastructure gaps. VA concurred that it needs to address SCIP limitations that are within its control, as GAO recommended; VA has made some progress in implementing the recommendation has made some progress in implementing the recommendation.\\ The VAIP process is estimated to cost $108 million and to produce market-level service delivery plans and facility master plans. However, the VAIP master plans incorrectly assume that all future growth in services will be provided directly through VA facilities without considering alternatives, such as purchasing care from the community. GAO recommended that VA consider discontinuing the VAIP facility master plans pending an assessment of their value as a facility-planning tool. VA agreed with the recommendation and is implementing it while pursuing a national realignment strategy.. Key elements of the Department of Defense's (DOD) 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process could benefit VA's asset and infrastructure review. The key elements included: (1) establishing goals for the process, (2) developing criteria for evaluating closures and realignments, and (3) establishing an organizational structure to develop closure and realignment options. GAO identified key challenges that affected DOD's implementation of BRAC 2005 and the results achieved; these challenges would need to be addressed if VA is to successfully apply the process. These challenges included: (1) large, complex recommendations required sustained senior leadership's attention and a high level of coordination among many stakeholders, and (2) the large number of actions that depend on each other for successful implementation.

However, DOD's planning process for ERI has been separate from its established posture-planning processes, which has led to a lack of prioritization of ERI initiatives relative to those funded in the base budget. This has resulted in a lack of understanding of the relative importance of ERI initiatives and the potential for long-term fiscal risk if DOD shifts more ERI-associated enduring costs into its Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) budget. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommends that DOD prioritize ERI initiatives relative to those funded in the base budget, develop estimates for future sustainment costs, and provide Congress with estimates of the future costs for posture initiatives funded under ERI. DOD has partially concurred with these recommendations, but the GAO remains concerned that DOD's current planning process may lead to long-term fiscal risk and a lack of congressional visibility into ERI's future costs. The GAO also notes that DOD has requested funding for ERI enhancements using its OCO budget, which was not designed to plan for and fund long-term, enduring initiatives.

The Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying the Continuing Appropriations and Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017, included a provision for GAO to review matters related to ERI. In this report, we (1) describe changes in ERI's objectives, funding under ERI, and DOD's posture in Europe since 2014 and (2) evaluate the extent to which DOD's planning processes for posture initiatives funded under ERI prioritize those initiatives, estimate their long-term costs, and communicate their estimated costs to Congress. GAO analyzed DOD strategy documentation, budget and cost analysis guidance, budget justification materials, and cost and obligations data. GAO also interviewed knowledgeable officials within the Office of the Secretary of Defense, U.S. European Command, the military services, and the State Department. Since 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) has expanded the European Reassurance Initiative's (ERI) objectives, increased its funding, and planned enhancements to European posture. DOD expanded ERI's objectives from the short-term reassurance of allies and partners to include deterring Russian aggression in the long term and developing the capacity to field a credible combined force should deterrence fail. With respect to funding, DOD will have requested approximately $4.5 billion for ERI's posture enhancements through the end of fiscal year 2017 (about $3.2 billion for fiscal year 2017 alone), and in July 2016 EUCOM identified funding needs for future posture initiatives. The expansion of ERI's objectives has contributed to DOD's enhancing its posture in Europe. Specifically, DOD has increased the size and duration of Army combat unit deployments, planned to preposition Army equipment in Eastern Europe, added new enduring locations (e.g., locations that DOD expects to access and use to support U.S. security interests for the foreseeable future), improved infrastructure, and negotiated new agreements with European nations. As of April 2017, DOD was considering further force enhancements under ERI as part of the department's ERI budget request. DOD also was reviewing whether new enduring locations to support ERI were needed and was considering other improvements to existing infrastructure. DOD's process for planning ERI has not established priorities among posture initiatives funded under ERI relative to those in its base budget, nor estimated long-term sustainment costs for some posture initiatives funded under ERI, nor communicated future costs to Congress. ERI is being planned using a separate process from DOD's established processes and is funded from DOD's overseas contingency operations (OCO) appropriations. GAO found several weaknesses: Lack of prioritization : DOD establishes priorities among ERI posture initiatives but has not evaluated them against base budget initiatives using its posture management process. As a result, DOD lacks an understanding of the relative importance of ERI initiatives and may be investing in projects that it will not continue should OCO funding become unavailable. Lack of sustainment costs : EUCOM and the military services have not fully estimated the long-term costs to sustain equipment and construction funded under ERI. Based on DOD's approach for calculating rough order sustainment costs, GAO determined that these costs could be substantial. DOD officials said that GAO correctly applied DOD's approach for estimating sustainment costs, but noted that actual costs may be lower, because the military services may not fully fund sustainment. In the absence of comprehensive estimates, DOD has been limited in its ability to assess affordability and plan for future costs. Not communicating future costs : DOD limits Congress's visibility into the resources needed to implement ERI and achieve its objectives because it does not include future costs in its ERI budget request. This is a public version of a classified report issued in August 2017. Information on specific posture planning, guidance, and budget estimates that DOD deemed to be classified have been omitted from this report. GAO recommends that DOD prioritize ERI posture initiatives against initiatives in its base budget, develop cost estimates for sustaining initiatives, and communicate future costs to Congress. DOD partially concurred with GAO's recommendations. GAO continues to believe that these recommendations are warranted."], "length": 6478}
{"pred": " \nPassage 2 discusses the oversight of clinical care reviews at five VA medical centers. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that the medical centers lacked documentation for almost half of the reviews conducted, and in some cases, the required reviews were not conducted at all. The GAO also found that the medical centers did not always conduct reviews in a timely manner, with some reviews taking multiple years to initiate. The GAO attributed these shortcomings to inadequate VHA policy and oversight. The GAO recommended that VHA require documentation of all reviews, establish a timeliness requirement, and strengthen its oversight. The VA concurred with these recommendations and plans to revise existing policy and update the audit tool used by networks. The GAO also found that the medical centers failed to report providers to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) and state licensing boards as required, which facilitated providers who provided substandard care at one facility obtaining privileges at another VA medical center or outside of VA's healthcare system. The GAO recommended that VHA require its networks to establish a process for overseeing VA medical centers to ensure timely reporting to the NPDB and state licensing boards. The VA concurred with this recommendation and plans to include oversight of timely reporting in the standard audit tool used by networks. Overall, the GAO's findings highlight the need for improved oversight and accountability in the VA's clinical care review process.  The GAO's recommendations aim to ensure that providers who provide substandard care are held accountable and that veterans receive safe and high-quality care.  The VA's concurrence with these recommendations is a positive step towards improving the oversight of clinical care reviews.  However, the GAO's findings also suggest that more work is needed to ensure that the VA's clinical care review process is effective and that providers who provide substandard care are held accountable.

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (VAMC) officials are responsible for reviewing the clinical care delivered by their privileged providers—physicians and dentists who are approved to independently perform specific services—after concerns are raised. The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care. For example, GAO found that after one VAMC failed to report to the NPDB or SLBs a provider who resigned to avoid an adverse privileging action, a non-VA hospital in the same city took an adverse privileging action against that same provider for the same reason 2 years later."], "length": 6761}

The U.S. support was initially limited to providing precision-guided munitions and intelligence sharing, but it expanded over time to include in-flight refueling and military advice. However, the U.S. involvement in the conflict has been criticized by many lawmakers, who have expressed concerns about the humanitarian situation in Yemen, civilian casualties, and the role of Iran in the conflict. In 2016, the Obama Administration initiated a review of U.S. security assistance to Saudi Arabia, and in 2017, the Trump Administration notified Congress that it would proceed with proposed sales of precision-guided munitions to Saudi Arabia. The U.S. support for the coalition has been the subject of intense debate in Congress, with some lawmakers arguing that it is necessary to counter Iranian influence and others arguing that it is exacerbating the humanitarian crisis. In 2018, the Senate passed a resolution directing the President to remove U.S. forces from hostilities in Yemen, and the House passed a resolution expressing opposition to the U.S. involvement in the conflict. The U.S. involvement in the Yemen conflict remains a contentious issue, with many lawmakers expressing concerns about the humanitarian situation and the role of the U.S. in the conflict. The conflict has also been marked by a significant humanitarian crisis, with millions of people in need of food, water, and medical aid. The U.S. has provided significant humanitarian aid to Yemen, but the conflict has also led to a significant increase in civilian casualties and a worsening of the humanitarian situation. The conflict has also been marked by a significant increase in the use of drones and other military technology, which has raised concerns about the potential for further escalation and the impact on civilians. The U.S. involvement in the conflict has also been criticized by many human rights groups, who have expressed concerns about the use of cluster munitions and other weapons that have caused significant harm to civilians.

The 116th Congress may continue to debate U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition and Saudi Arabia's conduct of the war in Yemen, where fighting has continued since March 2015. The war has exacerbated a humanitarian crisis in Yemen that began in 2011; presently, the World Food Program reports that 20 million Yemenis face hunger in the absence of sustained food assistance. The difficulty of accessing certain areas of Yemen has made it hard for governments and aid agencies to count the war's casualties. Data collected by the U.S. and European-funded Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) suggest that 60,000 Yemenis have been killed since January 2016. The Trump Administration has opposed various congressional proposals, including initiatives to reject or condition proposed U.S. arms sales or to require an end to U.S. military support to Saudi-led coalition operations in Yemen.

Of the total $12.5 billion benefit payments in the same fiscal year, 60.0% was paid to retired workers, 8.0% to disabled workers, 14.4% to spouses, and 16.8% to survivors. The Railroad Retirement Act (RRA) authorizes retirement, disability, and survivor benefits for railroad workers and their families. RRA is financed primarily by payroll taxes, financial interchanges from Social Security, and transfers from the National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust (NRRIT). Railroad retirement payroll taxes have two tiers: the Tier I tax is essentially the same as the Social Security payroll tax and the Tier II tax is set each year based on the railroad retirement system's asset balances, benefit payments, and administrative costs. In FY2017, the gross RRA funding was about $12.7 billion. Railroad retirement annuities are also divided into two tiers. Tier I annuities are designed to be nearly equivalent to Social Security benefits and are based on both railroad retirement and Social Security-covered employment. However, Tier I annuities are more generous than Social Security benefits in certain situations. For example, at the age of 60, railroad workers with at least 30 years of covered railroad work may receive unreduced retirement annuities. Tier II annuities are similar to private pensions and based solely on covered railroad service. Tier II annuities are paid in addition to Tier I annuities. Railroad disability annuities may be payable to totally disabled railroad workers who are permanently disabled from all work and occupational disabled workers who are found to be permanently disabled from their regular railroad occupations. Eligible spouses and survivors of railroad workers may receive a certain portion of Tier I and Tier II benefits, but divorced spouses and surviving divorced spouses are eligible for only a certain portion of Tier I benefits. The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act (RUIA) authorizes unemployment and sickness benefits for railroad workers. RUIA is financed solely by railroad employers, whose contributions are based on the taxable earnings of their employees. Eligibility for railroad unemployment and sickness benefits is based on recent railroad service and earnings.

Federal law categorizes these employees into three types of service—the competitive service, the excepted service, and the Senior Executive Service (SES)—that may be distinguished by different selection, compensation, and other standards. Title 5 of the U.S. Code (Title 5) contains most of the standards governing federal employment, and OPM is generally responsible for implementing these requirements. The competitive service largely consists of all civil service positions in the executive branch, other than (1) positions excepted from the competitive service by statute; (2) positions appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate; and (3) the SES. Traditionally, OPM has administered examinations for entrance into the competitive service. These examinations are meant to be \"practical in character\" and relate to \"matters that fairly test the relative capacity and fitness of the applicants for the appointment sought.\" Title 5 also authorizes OPM to prescribe rules allowing agencies to hire candidates directly under specified circumstances. The excepted service includes designated civil service positions that are not in the competitive service or the SES and are not subject to competitive examination. OPM maintains authority to exempt a position from the competitive service when it determines that an appointment through competitive examination is not practicable, or the recruitment of students or recent graduates would be better achieved through alternate recruitment and assessment processes. The pay structure for the competitive service and the excepted service is similar. Both services are typically paid in accordance with the General Schedule, a schedule of annual basic pay rates that consists of 15 grades, designated \"GS-1\" through \"GS-15.\" This fixed pay scale is generally designed to reflect, among other things, equal pay for substantially equal work within a local pay area. Additionally, the competitive service and the excepted service generally have similar notice and appeal rights for adverse personnel actions. For example, before a removal, a suspension for more than 14 days, a reduction in grade or pay, or a furlough of 30 days or less, the agency must provide at least 30 days' advance written notice to the affected employee. The employee must also be given a reasonable time to respond to the notice and provide affidavits and other evidence to support the answer. Some adverse actions may also be appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB or Board), an independent, quasi-judicial agency that reviews and adjudicates specified personnel actions taken against qualifying federal employees. The SES is a corps of some 7,000 high-level government administrators who manage major programs and projects within most federal agencies. In these leadership roles, SES members may serve as a link between top-level political appointees of an agency and career civil servants within the agency. The SES is governed by a regulatory structure separate from the competitive and excepted services. While SES members are primarily career appointees chosen through a merit-based competitive hiring process, others are noncareer, limited term or limited emergency appointees (commonly political appointees) selected by agency leadership. To shield certain SES roles from political influence, some SES positions (career reserved positions) must be filled with career appointees, and Title 5 limits the number of noncareer and limited term appointees that may serve in SES positions. The SES pay structure is distinct from the rest of the civil service. Title 5 specifies that SES members are paid within a particular range based on an executive's individual performance or contribution to agency performance (or both), as measured under a performance appraisal system. In addition, Title 5 articulates special conditions and procedures for removing, suspending, or taking other adverse actions against a member of the SES. For example, career SES appointees who have successfully completed a one-year probationary period may be removed or subject to adverse action only for specified reasons, including misconduct and substandard performance. Career appointees must receive advance written notice of these actions, and an opportunity to appeal the action. In comparison, noncareer, limited term, and limited emergency appointees are generally not subject to the same protections and may be removed from the SES at any time."], "length": 7052}

GAO also interviewed Coast Guard officials responsible for administering these programs and obtained information on how they used data to inform decisionmaking. GAO interviewed a range of stakeholders, including federal and industry officials. GAO's prior work recommended multiple actions to improve the Coast Guard's program management by improving the quality of data it uses to manage and report on its mission performance. Specifically, GAO recommended actions such as collecting more complete data and clarifying the data limitations to facilitate more effective program management. For example, in December 2017, GAO found that more information is needed to calculate vessel safety statistics that could enhance the Coast Guard's knowledge about accident, injury, and fatality trends involving commercial fishing vessels. Having more complete information could be useful to carrying out its marine safety mission, and GAO recommended, among other things, that the Coast Guard ensure that data collected during commercial fishing vessel incident investigations is accurately captured. In 2018, the Coast Guard reported taking initial steps to capture more accurate data. GAO's prior work also identified areas where the Coast Guard could improve the transparency of the data it uses for reporting on its mission performance as well its capital planning purposes. For example, in an October 2017 report on performance goals, GAO found the Coast Guard's Annual Performance Report (APR) has not been released publicly since 2011. Consequently, there has not been full visibility over performance across all of the Coast Guard's missions. Coast Guard officials stated that a decision by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) leadership to limit the number of performance goals shared publicly had deterred the Coast Guard from public release of its APR. GAO recommended that APRs be available on the Coast Guard's website; the Coast Guard plans to publicly release future APRs. In addition, previous GAO reports found that the Coast Guard's annual 5-year capital investment plan, which projects acquisition funding needs for the upcoming 5 years, did not consistently reflect current total cost estimates or the effects of tradeoffs made as part of the annual budget cycle. GAO made recommendations to help the Coast Guard plan for future acquisitions and the difficult trade off decisions it will face given funding constraints. The Coast Guard agreed, but it is unclear when it will complete the 20-year plan.

{"pred": " Passage 2\nThe National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NRC) and other federal agencies have established guidelines for radiation exposure, including the linear no-threshold model, which assumes that the risk of cancer increases with every incremental increase in radiation exposure. The NRC has set dose limits for radiation exposure, which are below the level considered low dose by the National Academies. The agencies have also applied the principle that doses should be kept as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA). However, the funding for research on the health effects of low-dose radiation has decreased over the years, with a 48% decrease in annual funding from 2012 to 2016. The GAO recommends that the Secretary of Energy lead the development of a mechanism for interagency collaboration to determine roles and responsibilities for addressing priorities related to research on the health effects of low-dose radiation. The GAO believes that an interagency coordination mechanism is needed and that DOE is in the best position to lead agencies in developing the most appropriate mechanism.

The Department of Energy (DOE), Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Food and Drug Administration generally used the advice of scientific advisory bodies to develop and apply radiation protection requirements and guidance for workers and the public in the radiation exposure settings that GAO reviewed. These settings were: (1) the operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants; (2) the cleanup of sites with radiological contamination; (3) the use of medical equipment that produces radiation; and (4) accidental or terrorism-related exposure to radiation. Specifically, the agencies relied on the advice of three scientific advisory bodies that supported the use of a model that assumes the risk of cancer increases with every incremental radiation exposure. Accordingly, the agencies have set regulatory dose limits and issued guidance to confine exposure to levels that reduce the risk of cancer, while recognizing that scientific uncertainties occur in estimating cancer risks from low-dose radiation. For example, NRC requires nuclear power plants to consider measures for limiting workers' exposure below NRC's regulatory dose limit, such as by using robots for maintenance work in radiation areas. GAO identified seven federal agencies that funded research on low-dose radiation's health effects. In fiscal years 2012 to 2016, DOE, NRC, EPA, and four other federal agencies obligated about $210 million for such research . Although the agencies have collaborated on individual projects on radiation's health effects, they have not established a collaborative mechanism to set research priorities. GAO's previous work has shown that federal agencies can use such mechanisms to implement interagency collaboration to develop and coordinate sound science policies. In the past, DOE took a leading role in this area because DOE provided stable funding and advocated for greater coordination on research on low-dose radiation's health effects. However, since fiscal year 2012, DOE has phased out funding for one of its main research programs in this area. This has created a void in coordination efforts among federal agencies, and no other agency has stepped forward to fill this void. Because of DOE's prior experience as a leader in this area of research and its research responsibility under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, it could play an important role in helping federal agencies establish a coordinating mechanism for low-dose radiation research.

{"pred": " \nThe Department of Defense (DOD) has been exploring the use of commercially hosted payloads to gain space-based capabilities more quickly and affordably. This approach involves integrating a DOD payload onto a commercial satellite, which operates on orbit using the host satellite's resources. The benefits of commercially hosted payloads include cost savings, faster on-orbit capability, increased deterrence and resilience, and continual technology upgrades. DOD has launched three experimental payloads on commercial host satellites and plans to conduct three more missions through 2022, achieving cost savings of several hundred million dollars. However, DOD officials identified logistical challenges to matching government payloads with commercial host satellites, including size, weight, and power constraints, and the need for military spectrum for communications payloads. The Hosted Payload Office (HPO) is developing tools to help address these challenges, and DOD offices that have used hosted payloads have found ways to overcome them. Despite the potential benefits, DOD's knowledge of commercially hosted payloads is fragmented across the agency, and there is a lack of centralized collection and assessment of agency-wide data. The GAO recommends that the Secretary of Defense require programs using hosted payloads to provide cost and technical data, and lessons learned to a central office. DOD concurred with this recommendation, but noted that the Hosted Payload Office may not be the most appropriate office for centralizing DOD-wide hosted payload knowledge. Civil and other government agencies use commercially hosted payloads to enhance navigation systems, monitor environmental pollution, conduct scientific missions, and improve search and rescue systems, citing cost savings and the ability to leverage existing commercial schedules and technologies as key benefits.  The use of commercially hosted payloads has the potential to play a role in delivering needed capabilities on orbit more quickly and at a more affordable cost than traditional DOD space acquisitions. However, DOD's experience and the data collected so far are limited in informing decisions on the use of these payloads.  DOD would benefit from leveraging the knowledge and information gained from each hosted payload experience. Centralized collection and assessment of agency-wide data would help enable DOD to mitigate the logistical challenges inherent in matching payloads to hosts, and better position DOD to make reasoned, evidence-based decisions on whether a hosted payload would be a viable solution to meet warfighter needs.

For such satellite systems, a single adversary attack or on-orbit failure can result in the loss of billions of dollars of investment and significant loss of vital capabilities. As DOD plans new space systems and addresses an increasingly contested space environment, it has the opportunity to consider different acquisition approaches. One such approach is to integrate a government sensor or payload onto a commercial host satellite. House Armed Services Committee report 115-200, accompanying a bill for the Fiscal Year 2018 National Defense Authorization Act, included a provision for GAO to review DOD's use of commercially hosted payloads. This report (1) determines the extent to which DOD uses commercially hosted payloads and (2) describes and assesses factors that affect their use. GAO reviewed DOD policies, documentation, and planning documents, and interviewed a wide range of DOD and civil government officials, and commercial stakeholders. GAO and others have found that using commercial satellites to host government sensors or communications packages—called payloads—may be one way DOD can achieve on-orbit capability faster and more affordably. Using hosted payloads may also help facilitate a proliferation of payloads on orbit, making it more difficult for an adversary to defeat a capability. Since 2009, DOD has used three commercially hosted payloads, with three more missions planned or underway through 2022 (see figure below). DOD estimates that it has achieved cost savings of several hundred million dollars from using commercially hosted payloads to date, and expects to realize additional savings and deliver faster capabilities on orbit from planned missions. Cost savings can result from sharing development, launch, and ground system costs with the commercial host company. Among the factors that affect DOD's use of hosted payloads are a perception among some DOD officials that matching government payloads to commercial satellites is too difficult; and limited, fragmented knowledge on how to mitigate various challenges GAO found that further opportunities to use hosted payloads may emerge as DOD plans new and follow-on space systems in the coming years. However, DOD's knowledge on using hosted payloads is fragmented, in part because programs are not required to share information. In 2011, the Air Force created a Hosted Payload Office to provide expertise and other tools to facilitate matching government payloads with commercial hosts. However, GAO found that DOD programs using hosted payloads are not required and generally do not provide cost and technical data, or lessons learned, to the Hosted Payload Office, or another central office for analysis. Requiring programs that use hosted payloads agency-wide to provide this information to a central location would better position DOD to make informed decisions when considering acquisition approaches for upcoming space system designs.

In implementing this recommendation, DOD should assess whether the Air Force's Hosted Payload Office is the appropriate location to collect and analyze the data.

{"pred": " \nThe Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 provided funding for veterans to obtain health care services from community providers through the Choice Program. The program was administered by two TPAs, Health Net and TriWest, which were responsible for managing networks of community providers, scheduling appointments, and paying providers for their services. However, the program faced challenges, including untimely payments to TPAs, which resulted in delayed payments to community providers. VA officials stated that the limitations in its fee-basis claims system and underestimating the number of staff necessary to process Choice Program invoices contributed to the delays. Additionally, three Choice Program requirements, including the medical documentation requirement, timely filing requirement, and authorization requirement, led to claim denials and delayed payments. VA has taken steps to address these issues, including modifying two Choice Program requirements, eliminating the medical documentation requirement, and implementing a new payment system. However, VA is not collecting data or monitoring compliance with two Choice Program requirements, including the policy for VA medical facilities to review SARs within 5 days of receipt and the contractual requirement for responding to calls from community providers. This poses a risk to the Choice Program and the forthcoming Veterans Community Care Program, as community providers may delay care or deliver care that is not authorized, increasing the likelihood that their claims will be denied and they will not be paid. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommends that VA monitor data on SAR approval decision time frames and collect data and monitor compliance with the Choice Program contractual requirements pertaining to customer service for community providers. VA has concurred with these recommendations and is taking steps to address them. The GAO report highlights the importance of timely payments and customer service in ensuring veterans' timely access to care. The report also emphasizes the need for VA to collect data and monitor compliance with its contractual requirements to ensure the success of the Choice Program and the forthcoming Veterans Community Care Program.  The GAO report is available at no charge on the GAO website.  The report is a result of a study conducted by the GAO, which included interviews with VA officials, TPA officials, and community providers. The report provides recommendations for VA to improve the timeliness of TPA claim payments to providers and to improve customer service for community providers. The report also highlights the importance of monitoring data on SAR approval decision time frames and collecting data and monitoring compliance with the Choice Program contractual requirements pertaining to customer service for community providers. The report is a valuable resource for VA officials, TPA officials, and community providers who are working to", "answers": ["Questions have been raised about the lack of timeliness of TPAs' payments to community providers under the Choice Program and how this may affect the willingness of providers to participate in the program as well as in the forthcoming Veterans Community Care Program. You asked GAO to review issues related to the timeliness of TPAs' payments to community providers under the Choice Program. This report examines, among other things, (1) the length of time TPAs have taken to pay community providers' claims and factors affecting timeliness of payments, and (2) actions taken by VA and the TPAs to reduce the length of time TPAs take to pay community providers for Choice Program claims. GAO reviewed TPA data on the length of time taken to pay community provider claims from November 2014 through June 2018, the most recent data available at the time of GAO's review. GAO also reviewed documentation, such as the contracts between VA and its TPAs, and interviewed VA and TPA officials. In addition, GAO interviewed a non-generalizable sample of 15 community providers, selected based on their large Choice Program claims volume, to learn about their experiences with payment timeliness. The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Veterans Choice Program (Choice Program) was created in 2014 to address problems with veterans' timely access to care at VA medical facilities. The Choice Program allows eligible veterans to obtain health care services from providers not directly employed by VA (community providers), who are then reimbursed for their services through one of the program's two third-party administrators (TPA). GAO's analysis of TPA data available for November 2014 through June 2018 shows that the length of time the TPAs took to pay community providers' clean claims each month varied widely—from 7 days to 68 days. VA and its TPAs identified several key factors affecting timeliness of payments to community providers under the Choice Program, including VA's untimely payments to TPAs, which in turn extended the length of time TPAs took to pay community providers' claims; and inadequate provider education on filing claims. VA has taken actions to address key factors that have contributed to the length of time TPAs have taken to pay community providers. For example, VA updated its payment system and related processes to pay TPAs more quickly. According to VA data, as of July 2018, VA was paying at least 90 percent of the TPAs' invoices within 7 days. In addition, VA and the TPAs have taken steps to improve provider education to help providers resolve claims processing issues. However, 9 of the 15 providers GAO interviewed said they continue to experience lengthy telephone hold times. According to VA and TPA officials, steps have been taken to improve the customer service offered to community providers. However, VA officials do not collect data on or monitor TPA compliance with customer service requirements—such as calls being answered within 30 seconds or less—for provider calls because they said they are not enforcing the requirements and are allowing TPAs to prioritize calls from veterans. Without collecting data and monitoring compliance, VA does not have information on challenges providers may face when contacting TPAs to resolve payment issues. GAO is making two recommendations, including that VA should collect data on and monitor compliance with its requirements pertaining to customer service for community providers. VA concurred with GAO's recommendations and described steps it will take to implement them."], "length": 6673}
{"pred": " Passage 1\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) regulates the disposal of controlled substances through its administration and enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act. The DEA allows the public to deliver unused controlled substances to authorized collectors, such as pharmacies, for disposal. As of April 2017, only about 2.5% of eligible entities had registered to use disposal bins to collect unused prescription drugs. The main reasons for low participation rates include costs associated with purchasing and maintaining disposal bins, uncertainty over proper implementation, and participation in other similar efforts for disposing of unused prescription drugs. The DEA has provided guidance on the disposal of controlled substances, but stakeholders have raised concerns about conflicting requirements with other state and federal regulations. The DEA has not collected data on the extent to which individuals use prescription drug disposal bins, but estimates suggest that about half of the country's population lives within 5 miles of a disposal bin. The availability of disposal bins varies significantly depending on urban or rural location, with North Dakota having the highest participation rate and Connecticut, Missouri, and Maine having the lowest. External funding has been provided to some authorized collectors to alleviate costs, and some localities have enacted laws requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay for certain costs associated with drug disposal. Overall, the DEA's efforts to regulate the disposal of controlled substances have been hindered by low participation rates and conflicting requirements.

About half of the people who reported misusing prescription drugs in 2015 received them from a friend or relative. One way to help prevent this kind of diversion and potential misuse is by providing secure and convenient ways to dispose of unused, unneeded, or expired prescription medications. The Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010 authorizes pharmacies and other entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances to also collect unused prescription drugs for disposal. In 2014, DEA finalized regulations for the implementation of the Act, establishing a voluntary process for eligible entities to become authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs using disposal bins. GAO was asked to review participation among authorized collectors that maintain disposal bins. In this report GAO describes (1) participation rates among entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs and (2) factors that affect participation. GAO analyzed the most currently available DEA data from April 2017 on entities eligible to participate and those participating as authorized collectors. GAO also conducted interviews with DEA officials and a nongeneralizable sample of 11 stakeholder organizations selected to illustrate different types of authorized collectors and long-term care facilities. GAO is not making any recommendations. DEA provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. GAO found that about 3 percent of pharmacies and other entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs for disposal have volunteered to do so. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) authorizes these entities to dispose of unused drugs to help reduce their potential misuse. Analysis of DEA data shows that as of April 2017, 2,233 of the 89,550 (2.49 percent) eligible entities—that is, certain entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances—had registered with DEA to use disposal bins to collect unused prescription drugs. Most—about 81 percent—of the authorized collectors were pharmacies, followed by hospitals or clinics. GAO also found that participation rates varied by state, though in 44 states less than 5 percent of the state's pharmacies and other eligible entities had registered to become authorized collectors. Stakeholders cited several factors that may explain why relatively few pharmacies and other eligible entities have registered with DEA as authorized collectors of unused drugs. Most notably, stakeholders representing authorized collectors told GAO that because participation is voluntary, the cost associated with maintaining a disposal bin—which includes purchasing and installing the bin according to DEA requirements and paying for the destruction of its contents—is an important factor to weigh against potential benefits. DEA noted that availability of disposal by law enforcement agencies also contributes to low participation."], "length": 6622}

The National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements and the International Commission on Radiological Protection recommend using the linear no-threshold model to estimate cancer risks from radiation exposure. This model assumes that the risk of cancer increases with every incremental increase in radiation exposure. The National Academies have published reports on the health effects of radiation exposure, including a 2006 report that stated that the balance of evidence from various types of studies tends to favor a simple proportionate relationship between radiation at low doses and cancer risk.

According to the report, the risk of cancer increases with every incremental increase in radiation exposure, and the linear no-threshold model is used to estimate cancer risks from low-dose radiation. However, the passage notes that there is uncertainty about the extent to which the health effects of radiation exposure can be extrapolated from non-U.S. populations, such as Japanese atomic bomb survivors, to a U.S. population that is regularly exposed to low-dose radiation. The passage also discusses the funding for research on the health effects of low-dose radiation, noting that the seven federal agencies that provided funding for this research collectively decreased their annual funding obligations by 48 percent from fiscal year 2012 to fiscal year 2016. The passage concludes by recommending that the Secretary of Energy lead the development of a mechanism for interagency collaboration to determine roles and responsibilities for addressing priorities related to research on the health effects of low-dose radiation. The passage also notes that DOE did not agree with this recommendation, citing its legal mandates and budget authorities, but the GAO believes that an interagency coordination mechanism for low-dose research is needed and that DOE is in the best position to lead agencies in developing the most appropriate mechanism.

{"pred": " \nThe Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is a government agency that insures private mortgage lenders against borrower default. To be eligible for FHA insurance, the mortgage must be originated by an approved lender, and the borrower and mortgage must meet certain criteria. The FHA plays a countercyclical role in the mortgage market, insuring more mortgages during economic downturns and fewer during economic booms. FHA-insured mortgages have lower down payment requirements and less stringent credit history requirements than conventional mortgages, making them attractive to first-time homebuyers, low- and moderate-income households, and minorities. However, some have questioned whether FHA-insured mortgages are too risky, as they often have a higher likelihood of default due to low down payments and lower credit scores. The FHA has taken steps to strengthen the insurance fund, including increasing mortgage insurance premiums and strengthening underwriting requirements. In 2018, FHA insured over 1 million new single-family purchase and refinance mortgages, with an initial loan balance of $209 billion. The overall number of mortgages insured by FHA in 2018 represented a decrease from 2017, but FHA's market share remains higher than it was in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The FHA's market share can be measured in different ways, but it tends to fluctuate in response to economic conditions and other factors. The agency's market share peaked at over 30% of home-purchase mortgages in 2009 and 2010, and over 20% of all mortgages in 2009. In 2017, FHA insured 19.5% of new home purchase mortgages and about 16.7% of new mortgages overall. The FHA's market share has decreased somewhat from its peak during the housing market turmoil, but it remains a significant player in the mortgage market. The agency's market share is likely to continue to be a topic of debate among policymakers. The FHA has a long history of insuring home loans, dating back to 1934, and has insured over 47.5 million home loans since its inception. The agency's financial status is closely tied to the performance of the mortgage market, and it has taken steps to strengthen the insurance fund in response to the housing market turmoil. The FHA's market share is influenced by a variety of factors, including economic conditions, loan limits, and mortgage insurance premiums. The agency's market share is likely to continue to be a topic of debate among policymakers, and its role in the mortgage market will likely continue to evolve in response", "answers": ["The Federal Housing Administration (FHA), an agency of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), was created by the National Housing Act of 1934. FHA insures private lenders against the possibility of borrowers defaulting on mortgages that meet certain criteria, thereby expanding the availability of mortgage credit beyond what may be available otherwise. If the borrower defaults on the mortgage, FHA is to repay the lender the remaining amount owed. A household that obtains an FHA-insured mortgage must meet FHA's eligibility and underwriting standards, including showing that it has sufficient income to repay a mortgage. FHA requires a minimum down payment of 3.5% from most borrowers, which is lower than the down payment required for many other types of mortgages. FHA-insured mortgages cannot exceed a statutory maximum mortgage amount, which varies by area and is based on area median house prices but cannot exceed a specified ceiling in high-cost areas. (The ceiling is set at $726,525 in high-cost areas in calendar year 2019.) Borrowers are charged fees, called mortgage insurance premiums, in exchange for the insurance. In FY2018, FHA insured over 1 million new mortgages (including both home purchase and refinance mortgages) with a combined principal balance of $209 billion. FHA's share of the mortgage market tends to vary with economic conditions and other factors. In the aftermath of the housing market turmoil that began around 2007 and a related contraction of mortgage lending, FHA insured a larger share of mortgages than it had in the preceding years. Its overall share of the mortgage market increased from about 3% in calendar year 2005 to a peak of 21% in 2009. Since that time, FHA's share of the mortgage market has decreased somewhat, though it remains higher than it was in the early 2000s. In calendar year 2017, FHA's overall share of the mortgage market was about 17%. FHA-insured mortgages, like all mortgages, experienced increased default rates during the housing downturn that began around 2007, leading to concerns about the stability of the FHA insurance fund for single-family mortgages, the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMI Fund). In response to these concerns, FHA adopted a number of policy changes in an attempt to limit risk to the MMI Fund. These changes have included raising the fees that it charges and making changes to certain eligibility criteria for FHA-insured loans."], "length": 6511}

The Hoover Building's original design is inefficient, and much of its space is unusable. The FBI has security concerns about the building and some of its annexes, and the building's condition is deteriorating. The General Services Administration (GSA) has assessed the FBI's facility needs and determined that a new headquarters is necessary. However, the GSA has limited experience with swap exchanges, a funding mechanism that allows the agency to exchange federal property for construction services or newly constructed assets. The GAO has recommended that the GSA develop criteria for determining when to solicit market interest in a swap exchange and has identified alternative funding mechanisms, such as public-private partnerships, that can be used to fund real property projects. The GAO has also noted that projects with alternative funding mechanisms present multiple forms of risk that are shared between the agency and any partner or stakeholder.

The GAO", "answers": ["GSA, which manages federal real property on behalf of other federal agencies, faces challenges in funding new construction projects due to budget constraints—including obtaining upfront funding—among other reasons. One type of transaction, called a swap exchange, enables GSA to apply the value of federal property to finance construction without relying on appropriated funds. Under such an exchange, GSA transfers the title of the unneeded property to a private investor after receiving the agreed upon construction services at another location. GSA proposed a swap exchange procurement for construction of a new FBI headquarters building in exchange for the Hoover Building and appropriations to compensate for the difference in value between the Hoover Building and the new building. GSA cancelled this procurement in July 2017 due to lack of funding. This statement addresses (1) GSA's and FBI's assessments of the Hoover Building, (2) GSA efforts to implement swap exchanges, and (3) alternative approaches to funding real property projects. It is based on GAO's body of reports on real property from 2011 to 2017, and selected updates from GSA. In November 2011, GAO reported that, according to General Services Administration (GSA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) assessments, the FBI's headquarters building (Hoover Building) and its accompanying facilities in Washington, D.C., did not fully support the FBI's long-term security, space, and building condition requirements. Since GAO's report, the assessments have not materially changed, for example: Security: GAO's prior work noted that the dispersion of staff in annexes creates security challenges, including where some space was leased by the FBI and other space was leased by nonfederal tenants. Earlier this year, GAO reported the FBI is leasing space in D.C. from foreign owners. Space : In 2011, GAO reported that FBI and GSA studies showed that much of the Hoover Building is unusable. GSA noted in its fiscal year 2017 project prospectus for the FBI headquarters consolidation that the Hoover Building cannot be redeveloped to meet the FBI's current needs. Building Condition: In GAO's 2011 report, GAO noted that the condition of the Hoover Building was deteriorating, and GSA assessments identified significant recapitalization needs. Since GAO's report and in response to GAO's recommendation, GSA has evaluated its approach to maintaining the building and completed some repairs to ensure safety. GSA has limited experience in successfully completing swap exchange transactions and chose not to pursue several proposed swap exchanges, most recently the planned swap exchange for the Hoover Building. GSA has developed criteria for determining when to solicit market interest in a swap exchange, in response to recommendations in GAO's 2014 report. In addition, GSA officials told GAO that they planned to improve the swap exchange process, including the property appraisal process, outreach to stakeholders to identify potential risks associated with future projects, and to the extent possible, mitigate such risks. Nevertheless, several factors may continue to limit use of swap exchanges, including market factors, such as the availability of alternative properties and an investor's approach for valuing properties. For example, in reviewing a proposed swap exchange in Washington, D.C., GAO found in a 2016 report that the proposals from two firms valued the two federal buildings involved in the proposed swap substantially less than GSA's appraised property value. In a 2014 report, GAO identified a number of alternative approaches to funding real property projects. Congress has provided some agencies with specific authorities to use alternative funding mechanisms—including the use of private sector funds or land swaps—for the acquisition, renovation, or disposal of federal real property without full, upfront funding, though GAO has previously reported that upfront funding is the best way to ensure recognition of commitments made in budgeting decisions and maintain fiscal controls. GAO has reported that projects with alternative funding mechanisms present multiple forms of risk that are shared between the agency and any partner or stakeholder. In addition, alternative budgetary structures could be established, such as changing existing or introducing new account structures to fund real property projects. GAO has made recommendations in the past to GSA on various real property issues, including to develop additional guidance for swap exchanges and to evaluate its approach to maintaining the Hoover Building.

Anticipating future needs, DOD began investing in new radar systems that share capabilities with Cobra Dane to support ballistic missile defense and space surveillance, including the LRDR (Alaska), the Space Fence (Marshall Islands), and the Pacific Radar (location to be determined). The conference report accompanying a bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 included a provision that GAO review the Air Force's report to Congress on the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane. This report identifies information included in the Air Force's report and describes additional information that GAO reviewed on (1) the capabilities of the Cobra Dane radar and other planned radars to meet DOD's mission requirements, (2) Cobra Dane's operational availability and the plan to mitigate the effect on those missions when Cobra Dane is not available, and (3) DOD's funding plan and project cost estimates for the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane and its site at Shemya Island. GAO reviewed the Air Force report and related documentation, and interviewed relevant officials. In its January 2018 report to Congress, the Air Force reported how the Cobra Dane radar and the Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR) have shared and unique capabilities to support ballistic missile defense and space surveillance missions. The report noted that the respective locations of both radar systems affect their ability to provide those capabilities. The Department of Defense (DOD) also has other radar investments—the Pacific Radar and the Space Fence, which, according to DOD officials, may reduce DOD's reliance on Cobra Dane to provide ballistic missile defense and space surveillance capabilities. The Air Force's report to Congress noted that Cobra Dane met its requirement for operational availability, which refers to the percentage of time that the radar is able to meet its missions. GAO found that the Air Force has developed procedures to mitigate risks when Cobra Dane is not available. For example, U.S. Northern Command and Missile Defense Agency (MDA) officials stated that they can mitigate risks when Cobra Dane is not available by using the Sea-Based X-band radar to provide support for ballistic missile defense. The Air Force would face some limitations in its ability to conduct space surveillance if Cobra Dane were not available, as Cobra Dane tracks objects no other radar can track. However, MDA officials noted there are no plans to take Cobra Dane offline long enough to compromise space surveillance. The Air Force and MDA plan to contribute total funding of $278.6 million for the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane, according to their fiscal year 2019 budget plans. Specifically, the Air Force and MDA plan to share funding for the operation and maintenance of the Cobra Dane radar and for three modernization projects that make up their sustainment plan for the radar.

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (VAMC) officials are responsible for reviewing the clinical care delivered by their privileged providers—physicians and dentists who are approved to independently perform specific services—after concerns are raised. The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care. For example, GAO found that after one VAMC failed to report to the NPDB or SLBs a provider who resigned to avoid an adverse privileging action, a non-VA hospital in the same city took an adverse privileging action against that same provider for the same reason 2 years later."], "length": 6794}

{"pred": " Passage 2\nThe National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NRC) and other federal agencies have established guidelines for radiation exposure based on the linear no-threshold model, which assumes that the risk of cancer increases with every incremental increase in radiation exposure. The NRC has set dose limits for radiation exposure that are below the level considered low dose by the National Academies, and has applied the principle that doses should be kept as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA). However, the effects of low-dose radiation are more difficult to detect, and data do not definitively establish the dose-response relationship between cancer and radiation exposure below 100 millisieverts (mSv). The NRC and other agencies have funded research on the health effects of low-dose radiation, but funding has decreased over the past five years. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has recommended that the Secretary of Energy lead the development of a mechanism for interagency collaboration to determine roles and responsibilities for addressing priorities related to research on the health effects of low-dose radiation. The GAO believes that such a mechanism would help agencies address shared research priorities and reduce uncertainty in predicting cancer risk from low-dose radiation. However, the Department of Energy (DOE) has not agreed with this recommendation, citing its own legal mandates and budget authorities. The GAO continues to believe that an interagency coordination mechanism for low-dose research is needed and that DOE is in the best position to lead agencies in developing the most appropriate mechanism. Key evidence presented includes data on the funding for research on the health effects of low-dose radiation, which has decreased by 48% over the past five years, and the NRC's dose limits for radiation exposure, which are below the level considered low dose by the National Academies. Unique points made in the passage include the use of the linear no-threshold model and the principle of ALARA, which are used to guide radiation protection requirements and guidance for workers and the public. The passage also highlights the need for interagency collaboration to address shared research priorities and reduce uncertainty in predicting cancer risk from low-dose radiation. Overall, the passage presents a nuanced view of the challenges and complexities of radiation protection and the need for continued research and collaboration to address these issues.

The Department of Energy (DOE), Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Food and Drug Administration generally used the advice of scientific advisory bodies to develop and apply radiation protection requirements and guidance for workers and the public in the radiation exposure settings that GAO reviewed. These settings were: (1) the operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants; (2) the cleanup of sites with radiological contamination; (3) the use of medical equipment that produces radiation; and (4) accidental or terrorism-related exposure to radiation. Specifically, the agencies relied on the advice of three scientific advisory bodies that supported the use of a model that assumes the risk of cancer increases with every incremental radiation exposure. Accordingly, the agencies have set regulatory dose limits and issued guidance to confine exposure to levels that reduce the risk of cancer, while recognizing that scientific uncertainties occur in estimating cancer risks from low-dose radiation. For example, NRC requires nuclear power plants to consider measures for limiting workers' exposure below NRC's regulatory dose limit, such as by using robots for maintenance work in radiation areas. GAO identified seven federal agencies that funded research on low-dose radiation's health effects. In fiscal years 2012 to 2016, DOE, NRC, EPA, and four other federal agencies obligated about $210 million for such research . Although the agencies have collaborated on individual projects on radiation's health effects, they have not established a collaborative mechanism to set research priorities. GAO's previous work has shown that federal agencies can use such mechanisms to implement interagency collaboration to develop and coordinate sound science policies. In the past, DOE took a leading role in this area because DOE provided stable funding and advocated for greater coordination on research on low-dose radiation's health effects. However, since fiscal year 2012, DOE has phased out funding for one of its main research programs in this area. This has created a void in coordination efforts among federal agencies, and no other agency has stepped forward to fill this void. Because of DOE's prior experience as a leader in this area of research and its research responsibility under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, it could play an important role in helping federal agencies establish a coordinating mechanism for low-dose radiation research.

The U.S. support was initially limited to providing precision-guided munitions and intelligence sharing, but it expanded over time to include in-flight refueling and military advice. However, the U.S. involvement in the conflict has been criticized by many lawmakers, who have expressed concerns about the humanitarian situation in Yemen, civilian casualties, and the role of Iran in the conflict. In 2016, the Obama Administration initiated a review of U.S. security assistance to Saudi Arabia, and in 2017, the Trump Administration notified Congress that it would proceed with proposed sales of precision-guided munitions to Saudi Arabia. The U.S. support for the coalition has been the subject of intense debate in Congress, with some lawmakers arguing that it is necessary to counter Iranian influence and others arguing that it is exacerbating the humanitarian crisis. In 2018, the Senate passed a resolution directing the President to remove U.S. forces from hostilities in Yemen, and the House passed a resolution expressing opposition to the U.S. involvement in the conflict. The U.S. involvement in the Yemen conflict remains a contentious issue, with many lawmakers expressing concerns about the humanitarian situation and the role of the U.S. in the conflict. The conflict has also been marked by a significant humanitarian crisis, with millions of people in need of food, water, and medical aid. The U.S. has provided significant humanitarian aid to Yemen, but the conflict has also led to a significant increase in civilian casualties and a worsening of the humanitarian situation. The conflict has also been marked by a significant increase in the use of drones and other military technology, which has raised concerns about the potential for further escalation and the impact on civilians. The U.S. involvement in the conflict has also been criticized by many human rights groups, who have expressed concerns about the use of cluster munitions and other weapons that have caused significant harm to civilians.

The 116th Congress may continue to debate U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition and Saudi Arabia's conduct of the war in Yemen, where fighting has continued since March 2015. The war has exacerbated a humanitarian crisis in Yemen that began in 2011; presently, the World Food Program reports that 20 million Yemenis face hunger in the absence of sustained food assistance. The difficulty of accessing certain areas of Yemen has made it hard for governments and aid agencies to count the war's casualties. Data collected by the U.S. and European-funded Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) suggest that 60,000 Yemenis have been killed since January 2016. The Trump Administration has opposed various congressional proposals, including initiatives to reject or condition proposed U.S. arms sales or to require an end to U.S. military support to Saudi-led coalition operations in Yemen.

The agencies have varying authorities to acquire and dispose of land, with the Bureau of Land Management having the broadest authority. The acquisition authorities are designed to allow federal agencies to acquire lands that benefit from federal management, while disposal authorities allow agencies to dispose of land no longer required for federal purposes. The federal government faces questions on the adequacy of existing acquisition and disposal authorities, with Congress considering measures to establish, modify, or eliminate these authorities. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) is the principal financing mechanism for federal land acquisition, with Congress determining the level of appropriations each year. The four federal land management agencies have different standing authorities for acquiring and disposing of lands, with the National Park Service having the narrowest authorities and the Bureau of Land Management having the broadest. The agencies' acquisition and disposal authorities are subject to various laws and regulations, with some authorities allowing for the exchange of lands, sales, or transfers to other entities. The federal government's land ownership and management policies remain controversial, with some advocating for the divestment of federal lands and others supporting the retention of lands in federal ownership. The LWCF has expired, and its reauthorization is a topic of debate, with some proposing permanent reauthorization and others seeking to direct a portion of funding to specific purposes. The federal government's land acquisition and disposal policies are complex and multifaceted, with various laws and regulations governing the agencies' authorities. The Bureau of Land Management has broad authority to acquire and dispose of land, while the National Park Service has limited authority to dispose of land. The U.S. Forest Service has various authorities to acquire and dispose of land, including the Weeks Act of 1911, which allows for the acquisition of lands within or contiguous to national forest boundaries. The Fish and Wildlife Service has various authorities to acquire land, including the Migratory Bird Conservation Act of 1929, which authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to recommend areas for the conservation of migratory birds. The federal government's land ownership and management policies are subject to ongoing debate and consideration by Congress.

Four agencies—the National Park Service (NPS), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in the Department of the Interior, and the U.S. Forest Service (FS) in the Department of Agriculture—administer about 95% of those lands. The extent to which each of these four federal agencies have authority to acquire and dispose of land varies considerably. The BLM has relatively broad authority for both acquisitions and disposals under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA). The agency also has other authorities for disposing of land, including two laws that allow the agency to retain the proceeds for subsequent land acquisition, among other purposes, and a law that allows transfers to governmental units and other entities for public purposes. By contrast, the NPS has no general authority to acquire land to create new park units or to dispose of park lands. The FS authority to acquire lands is mostly limited to lands within or contiguous to the boundaries of a national forest. The agency has various authorities to dispose of land, but they are relatively constrained and infrequently used. The FWS has various authorities to acquire lands but no general authority to dispose of its lands. The agency frequently uses acquisition authority under the Migratory Bird Conservation Act of 1929 because of the availability of funding through the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund. The nature of the acquisition and disposal authorities of the four federal agencies also varies. In general, the acquisition authorities are designed to allow the four agencies to bring into federal ownership lands that many contend could benefit from federal management. Disposal authorities generally are designed to allow agencies to convey land that is no longer needed for a federal purpose or that might be chiefly valuable for another purpose. Some of the authorities specify particular circumstances where they can be used, such as the conveyance of FS land for educational purposes and the disposal of BLM land for recreation and public purposes. Congress often faces questions on the adequacy of existing acquisition and disposal authorities; the nature, extent, and location of their use; and the extent of federal land ownership overall. The current acquisition and disposal authorities form the backdrop for consideration of measures to establish, modify, or eliminate authorities, or to provide for the acquisition or disposal of particular lands. In some cases, Congress enacts bills to provide authority to acquire or dispose of particular parcels where no standing authority exists and, in other cases, to direct or facilitate land transactions. Congress also addresses acquisition and disposal policy in the context of debates on the role and goals of the federal government in owning and managing land generally, and it has considered broader measures to dispose of lands or to promote acquisition. Other issues for Congress pertain to the sources and levels of funds for land acquisition. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) is the primary source of funding for land acquisition. Congress has considered diverse measures related to the LWCF, such as legislation to make LWCF funding permanent and bills to direct LWCF monies to additional, nonacquisition purposes. Additionally, the FWS has the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund, an account with mandatory spending authority supported by revenue from three sources.

{"pred": " Passage 2\nThe National Academy of Sciences has established a linear no-threshold model, which assumes that the risk of cancer increases with every incremental increase in radiation exposure. This model is used by federal agencies, including the NRC, EPA, and DOE, to set dose limits for radiation exposure. The agencies have established limits on occupational dose and public dose, with the NRC's annual dose limit for members of the public being a hundredth of the level considered low dose by the National Academies. The agencies also apply the principle of ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) to keep exposures to radiation as far below dose limits as is practical. However, the agencies have decreased their annual funding obligations for research on the health effects of low-dose radiation by 48% from 2012 to 2016, with DOE accounting for a large portion of this decrease. The GAO recommends that the Secretary of Energy lead the development of a mechanism for interagency collaboration to determine roles and responsibilities for addressing priorities related to research on the health effects of low-dose radiation. This recommendation is made because collaborative mechanisms can serve multiple purposes, such as leading interagency efforts to develop and coordinate sound science and technology policies across the federal government. The GAO believes that an interagency coordination mechanism for low-dose research is needed and that DOE is in the best position to lead agencies in developing the most appropriate mechanism.", "answers": ["This testimony summarizes the information contained in GAO's September 2017 report, entitled Low-Dose Radiation: Interagency Collaboration on Planning Research Could Improve Information on Health Effects ( GAO-17-546 ). The Department of Energy (DOE), Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Food and Drug Administration generally used the advice of scientific advisory bodies to develop and apply radiation protection requirements and guidance for workers and the public in the radiation exposure settings that GAO reviewed. These settings were: (1) the operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants; (2) the cleanup of sites with radiological contamination; (3) the use of medical equipment that produces radiation; and (4) accidental or terrorism-related exposure to radiation. Specifically, the agencies relied on the advice of three scientific advisory bodies that supported the use of a model that assumes the risk of cancer increases with every incremental radiation exposure. Accordingly, the agencies have set regulatory dose limits and issued guidance to confine exposure to levels that reduce the risk of cancer, while recognizing that scientific uncertainties occur in estimating cancer risks from low-dose radiation. For example, NRC requires nuclear power plants to consider measures for limiting workers' exposure below NRC's regulatory dose limit, such as by using robots for maintenance work in radiation areas. GAO identified seven federal agencies that funded research on low-dose radiation's health effects. In fiscal years 2012 to 2016, DOE, NRC, EPA, and four other federal agencies obligated about $210 million for such research . Although the agencies have collaborated on individual projects on radiation's health effects, they have not established a collaborative mechanism to set research priorities. GAO's previous work has shown that federal agencies can use such mechanisms to implement interagency collaboration to develop and coordinate sound science policies. In the past, DOE took a leading role in this area because DOE provided stable funding and advocated for greater coordination on research on low-dose radiation's health effects. However, since fiscal year 2012, DOE has phased out funding for one of its main research programs in this area. This has created a void in coordination efforts among federal agencies, and no other agency has stepped forward to fill this void. Because of DOE's prior experience as a leader in this area of research and its research responsibility under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, it could play an important role in helping federal agencies establish a coordinating mechanism for low-dose radiation research.

Between fiscal years 2008 and 2018, attack submarines incurred 10,363 days of idle time and maintenance delays, with 82% of these delays attributed to depot maintenance. The Navy's SUBSAFE program, established after the USS Thresher sank in 1963, has ensured that no SUBSAFE-certified submarine has been lost, but the program has not addressed the root causes of maintenance delays. The Navy has begun to address workforce shortages and facilities needs at public shipyards, but these efforts will require sustained management attention to reach fruition. The Navy has not fully mitigated maintenance delays by not completing a comprehensive business case analysis to inform maintenance workload allocation across public and private shipyards. The Navy's attack submarine fleet provides the U.S. an asymmetric advantage, but the persistent maintenance delays have not allowed the Navy to achieve the full benefit of this investment. The Secretary of the Navy should ensure that the Chief of Naval Operations conducts a business case analysis to inform maintenance workload allocation across public and private shipyards. The Navy has taken the first steps to take a more holistic view of submarine maintenance requirements and impacts across both public and private shipyards, but more work is needed to address the challenges. The Navy's maintenance delays have resulted in significant costs, with an estimated $1.5 billion spent on attack submarines sitting idle while waiting to enter shipyards, and on those delayed in completing their maintenance at the shipyards. The Navy may have options to mitigate idle time and maintenance delays, such as leveraging private shipyard repair capacity, but a comprehensive business case analysis is needed to inform maintenance workload allocation. The Navy's attack submarine fleet has suffered from persistent and costly maintenance delays, and the Navy has not yet taken additional steps to maximize attack submarine readiness that fully address challenges such as the allocation of maintenance periods between public and private shipyards. Without addressing this challenge, the Navy will not achieve the full benefit of the nation's investment in its attack submarines, and it risks continued expenditure of operating and support funding to crew, maintain, and support attack submarines that provide no operational capability because they are delayed in getting into and out of maintenance.

These capabilities make attack submarines some of the most–requested assets by the global combatant commanders. GAO was asked to review the readiness of the Navy's attack submarine force. This report discusses the extent to which the Navy (1) has experienced maintenance delays in its attack submarine fleet and costs associated with any delays; and (2) has addressed any challenges and developed mitigation plans for any maintenance delays. GAO analyzed readiness information from fiscal years 2008-2018, operating and support costs, maintenance performance, and other data; visited attack submarines and squadrons; and interviewed public and private shipyard and fleet officials. This is a public version of a classified report issued in October 2018. Information the Department of Defense deemed classified or sensitive, such as attack submarine force structure requirements and detailed data on attack submarine maintenance delays, has been omitted. The Navy has been unable to begin or complete the vast majority of its attack submarine maintenance periods on time resulting in significant maintenance delays and operating and support cost expenditures. GAO's analysis of Navy maintenance data shows that between fiscal year 2008 and 2018, attack submarines have incurred 10,363 days of idle time and maintenance delays as a result of delays in getting into and out of the shipyards. For example, the Navy originally scheduled the USS Boise to enter a shipyard for an extended maintenance period in 2013 but, due to heavy shipyard workload, the Navy delayed the start of the maintenance period. In June 2016, the USS Boise could no longer conduct normal operations and the boat has remained idle, pierside for over two years since then waiting to enter a shipyard (see figure). GAO estimated that since fiscal year 2008 the Navy has spent more than $1.5 billion in fiscal year 2018 constant dollars to support attack submarines that provide no operational capability—those sitting idle while waiting to enter the shipyards, and those delayed in completing their maintenance at the shipyards. The Navy has started to address challenges related to workforce shortages and facilities needs at the public shipyards. However, it has not effectively allocated maintenance periods among public shipyards and private shipyards that may also be available to help minimize attack submarine idle time. GAO's analysis found that while the public shipyards have operated above capacity for the past several years, attack submarine maintenance delays are getting longer and idle time is increasing. The Navy may have options to mitigate this idle time and maintenance delays by leveraging private shipyard capacity for repair work. But the Navy has not completed a comprehensive business case analysis as recommended by Department of Defense guidelines to inform maintenance workload allocation across public and private shipyards. Navy leadership has acknowledged that they need to be more proactive in leveraging potential private shipyard repair capacity. Without addressing this challenge, the Navy risks continued expenditure of operating and support funding to crew, maintain, and support attack submarines that provide no operational capability because they are delayed in getting into and out of maintenance.

The use of cluster munitions has been widespread, with over 21 countries using them in various conflicts. However, the effectiveness and reliability of cluster munitions have been questioned, with some studies suggesting that up to 70% of submunitions fail to detonate. The Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM) was signed by 94 countries in 2008, banning the use of cluster munitions, but the United States has not signed the treaty. The US has instead developed a new policy on cluster munitions, which allows for their use in certain situations, but requires that they meet a 1% or less unexploded submunitions standard. The policy also calls for the development of new cluster munitions that are more reliable and have a lower failure rate. The use of cluster munitions has been criticized for its indiscriminate nature and the long-term risks it poses to civilians. The US military has suspended the use of cluster munitions in Iraq and Afghanistan, but continues to use them in other conflicts. The development of precision-guided munitions has reduced the need for cluster munitions, and some argue that they are no longer a necessary part of military strategy. The US has also been criticized for its failure to report providers who have been terminated for clinical deficiencies to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) and state licensing boards, which has allowed them to continue practicing medicine at other facilities. The VA has agreed to revise its policies and procedures to improve oversight and reporting of providers.

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (VAMC) officials are responsible for reviewing the clinical care delivered by their privileged providers—physicians and dentists who are approved to independently perform specific services—after concerns are raised. The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care. For example, GAO found that after one VAMC failed to report to the NPDB or SLBs a provider who resigned to avoid an adverse privileging action, a non-VA hospital in the same city took an adverse privileging action against that same provider for the same reason 2 years later."], "length": 6781}

The LWCF Act authorizes the fund to receive $900 million annually, with the monies available only if appropriated by Congress (i.e., discretionary appropriations). The fund also receives mandatory appropriations under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (GOMESA). The level of annual appropriations for the LWCF has varied since the origin of the fund in FY1965. The LWCF Act outlines uses of the fund for federal and state purposes. Of the total made available through appropriations or deposits under GOMESA, not less than 40% is to be used for \"federal purposes\" and not less than 40% is to be used to provide \"financial assistance to states.\" The act lists the federal purposes for which the President is to allot LWCF funds \"unless otherwise allotted in the appropriation Act making them available.\" These purposes primarily relate to acquisition of lands and waters (and interests therein) by the federal government. With regard to state purposes, the act authorizes a matching grant program to states for outdoor recreation purposes. Throughout the LWCF's history, appropriations acts typically have provided funds for land acquisition and outdoor recreational grants to states. Beginning in FY1998, appropriations also have been provided each year (except FY1999) to fund other purposes related to natural resources. The extent to which the LWCF should be used for purposes other than federal land acquisition and outdoor recreation grants to states, and which other purposes should be funded from the LWCF, continue to be the subject of legislation and debate in Congress. In the past few decades, Presidents have sought LWCF funds for a variety of other purposes. Congress chooses which if any of these requests to fund, and has chosen programs not sought by the President for a particular year. Among other programs, appropriations have been provided for facility maintenance of the land management agencies, ecosystem restoration, the Historic Preservation Fund, the Payments in Lieu of Taxes program, the Forest Legacy Program, State and Tribal Wildlife Grants (under the Fish and Wildlife Service), the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund, U.S. Geological Survey science and cooperative programs, and Bureau of Indian Affairs Indian Land and Water Claim Settlements. Since FY1998, a total of $2.7 billion has been appropriated for other purposes, of a total LWCF appropriation of $18.9 billion over the history of the fund. The Fish and Wildlife Service and the Forest Service have received the largest shares of the total appropriations for other purposes, about $1.4 billion (53%) and $1.0.billion (38%), respectively, from FY1998 to FY2019. Several agencies shared the remaining $0.2 billion (9%) of the appropriations. Both the dollar amounts and the percentages of annual LWCF appropriations for other purposes have varied widely since FY1998. The dollar amounts have ranged from $0 in FY1999 to $456.0 million in FY2001. The percentage of annual funds provided for other purposes ranged from 0% in FY1999 to a high of 59% in both FY2006 and FY2007. In some years, the appropriation for other purposes was significantly less than the Administration requested. For instance, for FY2008, the George W. Bush Administration sought $313.1 million; the appropriation was $101.3 million. The appropriation for other purposes last exceeded $100.0 million in FY2010, and most recently was $93.3 million, in FY2019. Prior to FY2008, several other purposes typically were funded each year from LWCF. Since FY2008, funds have been appropriated annually only for grants under two programs: Forest Legacy and Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund. These two programs and a third grant program—State and Tribal Wildlife Grants—have received more than three-quarters ($2.1 billion, 79%) of the total appropriation for other purposes since FY1998."], "length": 6783}
{"pred": " \nThe Purple Heart is a military award that has undergone several changes in eligibility over time. The award was initially created by George Washington in 1782 as the Badge of Military Merit, but it fell into disuse until it was revived by General Douglas MacArthur in 1932. Since then, the eligibility criteria for the Purple Heart have been expanded several times, including in 1942, 1952, 1962, and 1996. The most recent expansion of eligibility occurred in 2015, when Congress passed the National Defense Authorization Act, which redefined what constitutes an attack by a foreign terrorist organization and allowed for the award of Purple Hearts to servicemembers who were wounded or killed in such attacks. The debate over Purple Heart eligibility continues, with some arguing that mental injuries such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) should be eligible for the award, while others believe that it would dishonor those who have received Purple Hearts for physical injuries. The Department of Defense is currently reevaluating Purple Heart eligibility for traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and mental conditions such as PTSD. The National Alliance on Mental Illness is advocating for the Purple Heart to be awarded for psychological wounds including PTSD to eliminate stigma and encourage servicemembers to seek care. The Military Order of the Purple Heart and Veterans of Foreign Wars are resistant to accepting PTSD as grounds for eligibility, arguing that medals are not awarded for illness or disease, but for achievement and valor. The Purple Heart is a highly contested award, with different groups and individuals having varying opinions on its eligibility criteria. The award has been awarded to over 1 million servicemembers since 1932, and its eligibility criteria continue to be debated and refined. The Purple Heart is a symbol of sacrifice and bravery, and its eligibility criteria should reflect the changing nature of warfare and the needs of servicemembers. The debate over Purple Heart eligibility is ongoing, and it is likely that the award's eligibility criteria will continue to evolve in the future.

The conflicts 2001 to the present have greatly increased the number of Purple Hearts awarded to servicemembers. Events over the past few years have spurred debate on the eligibility criteria for the Purple Heart. Shootings on U.S. soil and medical conditions such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have prompted changes to the eligibility requirements for the Purple Heart. Some critics believe that these changes may lessen the value of the medal and the sacrifices of past recipients on the battlefield. In the past, efforts to modify the Purple Heart's eligibility requirements were contentious, and veterans groups were vocal concerning eligibility changes. While medal requirements are often left to the military and executive branch to decide, Congress is involved in Purple Heart eligibility, utilizing its constitutional power \"To Make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces\" (U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 8, clause 14). The Carl Levin and Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 (P.L. 113-291) included language that expands eligibility for the Purple Heart. Previous debates have raised several questions about the Purple Heart. In some respects, how an event is defined can determine eligibility: Is a servicemember the victim of a crime or a terrorist attack? Conversely, arguing that killed or wounded servicemembers \"should\" be eligible for the Purple Heart can redefine an event: Is the servicemember an advisor to a foreign military or a combatant? Are PTSD and other mental health conditions adequate injuries to warrant the Purple Heart? These are questions that Congress might consider if it chooses to act on this issue."], "length": 6275}

The review found that the medical centers lacked documentation for almost half of the reviews conducted, and in some cases, the required reviews were not conducted at all. The main argument is that the VA medical centers failed to adequately document and timely complete reviews of providers' clinical care, which is a critical component of ensuring patient safety. The key evidence presented includes the lack of documentation for 26 providers who required focused professional practice evaluations (FPPEs) for cause, and the failure to report nine providers to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) and state licensing boards as required. The review also found that VHA policy does not require documentation of all types of reviews, and VHA's oversight of the reviews is inadequate. The unique point made in the passage is that the lack of adequate documentation and timely completion of reviews of providers' clinical care can facilitate providers who provide substandard care at one facility obtaining privileges at another VA medical center or at hospitals outside of VA's healthcare system. The main conclusion is that VHA needs to improve its oversight of clinical care reviews and require documentation of all reviews, establish a timeliness requirement for initiating reviews, and strengthen its oversight to ensure that reviews are conducted and documented in a timely manner.

{"pred": " \nThe Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is a government agency that insures private mortgage lenders against borrower default. To be eligible for FHA insurance, the mortgage must be originated by an approved lender, and the borrower and mortgage must meet certain criteria. The FHA plays a countercyclical role in the mortgage market, insuring more mortgages during economic downturns and fewer during economic booms. FHA-insured mortgages have lower down payment requirements and less stringent credit history requirements than conventional mortgages, making them attractive to first-time homebuyers, low- and moderate-income households, and minorities. However, some have questioned whether FHA-insured mortgages are too risky, as they often have a higher likelihood of default due to low down payments and lower credit scores. The FHA has taken steps to strengthen the insurance fund, including increasing mortgage insurance premiums and strengthening underwriting requirements. In 2018, FHA insured over 1 million new single-family purchase and refinance mortgages, with an initial loan balance of $209 billion. The overall number of mortgages insured by FHA in 2018 represented a decrease from 2017, but FHA's market share remains higher than it was in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The FHA's market share can be measured in different ways, but it tends to fluctuate in response to economic conditions and other factors. The agency's market share peaked at over 30% of home-purchase mortgages in 2009 and 2010, and over 20% of all mortgages in 2009. In 2017, FHA insured 19.5% of new home purchase mortgages and about 16.7% of new mortgages overall. The FHA's market share has decreased somewhat from its peak during the housing market turmoil, but it remains a significant player in the mortgage market. The agency's market share is likely to continue to be a topic of debate among policymakers. The FHA has a long history of insuring home loans, dating back to 1934, and has insured over 47.5 million home loans since its inception. The agency's financial status is closely tied to the performance of the mortgage market, and it has taken steps to strengthen the insurance fund in response to the housing market turmoil. The FHA's market share is influenced by a variety of factors, including economic conditions, loan limits, and mortgage insurance premiums. The agency's market share is likely to continue to be a topic of debate among policymakers, and its role in the mortgage market will likely continue to evolve in response", "answers": ["The Federal Housing Administration (FHA), an agency of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), was created by the National Housing Act of 1934. FHA insures private lenders against the possibility of borrowers defaulting on mortgages that meet certain criteria, thereby expanding the availability of mortgage credit beyond what may be available otherwise. If the borrower defaults on the mortgage, FHA is to repay the lender the remaining amount owed. A household that obtains an FHA-insured mortgage must meet FHA's eligibility and underwriting standards, including showing that it has sufficient income to repay a mortgage. FHA requires a minimum down payment of 3.5% from most borrowers, which is lower than the down payment required for many other types of mortgages. FHA-insured mortgages cannot exceed a statutory maximum mortgage amount, which varies by area and is based on area median house prices but cannot exceed a specified ceiling in high-cost areas. (The ceiling is set at $726,525 in high-cost areas in calendar year 2019.) Borrowers are charged fees, called mortgage insurance premiums, in exchange for the insurance. In FY2018, FHA insured over 1 million new mortgages (including both home purchase and refinance mortgages) with a combined principal balance of $209 billion. FHA's share of the mortgage market tends to vary with economic conditions and other factors. In the aftermath of the housing market turmoil that began around 2007 and a related contraction of mortgage lending, FHA insured a larger share of mortgages than it had in the preceding years. Its overall share of the mortgage market increased from about 3% in calendar year 2005 to a peak of 21% in 2009. Since that time, FHA's share of the mortgage market has decreased somewhat, though it remains higher than it was in the early 2000s. In calendar year 2017, FHA's overall share of the mortgage market was about 17%.

The meeting is about designing a new remote control for televisions. The Project Manager asks the Industrial Designer to present his work on the remote control's working design. However, the Industrial Designer struggles to find his presentation on his computer, and the Project Manager helps him to locate it. The Industrial Designer then presents his design, explaining how the remote control works and suggesting several features, including a menu button and a bleep signal to indicate when the battery is low. The Project Manager asks several questions about the design, including the cost of the remote control and the feasibility of using a single battery. The Industrial Designer suggests that the remote control should be designed to be easy to use and should have a trendy design. The Marketing expert then presents her findings from a usability lab test, which show that users dislike the current design of remote controls and find them hard to use. She suggests that the new remote control should be designed to be easy to use and should have a simple design. The Project Manager then presents several new product requirements, including the use of the company's corporate color and slogan, and the need to make decisions about the controls to be included on the remote control. The team discusses the requirements and decides on several controls, including a power button, channel buttons, and a menu button.

{"pred": " Passage 2\nThe US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) faces challenges in aligning its services and real property portfolio to meet the needs of veterans. The VA has a large inventory of vacant or underutilized buildings, many of which are historic and difficult to renovate or demolish. The VA's Strategic Capital Investment Planning (SCIP) process has limitations, including subjective narratives, long timeframes, and restricted access to information, which undermine its ability to achieve its goals. The VA has also encountered challenges in engaging stakeholders, including veterans, local and state officials, and historic preservation groups, which has led to adversarial relationships and reduced the VA's ability to align facilities with the needs of the veteran population. The VA has discontinued its VAIP facility master plans, which assumed all future growth in services would be provided directly through VA facilities, and is pursuing a national realignment strategy. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommends that the VA address the limitations of the SCIP process and improve stakeholder communication guidance. The GAO also suggests that the VA consider adopting a BRAC-like process for its asset and infrastructure review, which involves establishing goals, criteria, and a common analytical framework, and involving stakeholders and the audit community to ensure data accuracy. The GAO notes that the VA's challenges are similar to those faced by the Department of Defense (DOD) in its BRAC process, and that the VA can learn from DOD's experience. The GAO identifies two key challenges that affected DOD's implementation of BRAC 2005, including the need for sustained senior leadership attention and a high level of coordination among stakeholders, and the complexity of interdependent recommendations. The GAO recommends that the VA address these challenges in its own asset and infrastructure review process. The GAO also notes that the VA has a large number of actions and interdependent recommendations, which complicates the implementation process. The GAO suggests that the VA consider using a BRAC-like process to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of its asset and infrastructure review process. Overall, the GAO's report highlights the need for the VA to improve its asset and infrastructure review process to better meet the needs of veterans. The report provides recommendations for the VA to address the challenges it faces in aligning its services and real property portfolio, and to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of its asset and infrastructure review process. The report also highlights the importance of stakeholder engagement and data accuracy in the VA's asset and infrastructure review process. The GAO's report provides a comprehensive analysis of the", "answers": ["VA operates one of the largest health care systems in the United States, utilizing more than 6,000 federally owned and 1,500 leased buildings. DOD has repeatedly applied the BRAC process to reduce the amount of unneeded property that it owns and leases and to save billions of dollars that could be applied to higher priority defense needs. This statement is based on GAO's April 2017 report related to VA facility alignment ( GAO-17-349 ) and numerous GAO reports related to the BRAC process as summarized in a June 2011 testimony ( GAO-11-704T ) and a March 2012 testimony ( GAO-12-513T ). This statement addresses (1) the factors that affect VA's facility alignment and the extent to which VA's capital-planning process facilitates the alignment of facilities with the veterans' population, and (2) the key elements and challenges affecting DOD and the Commission in BRAC 2005. Detailed information on our scope and methodologies for this work can be found in these published products, cited throughout this testimony. Geographic shifts in the veterans' population, changes in health care delivery, aging infrastructure, and limited stakeholder involvement affect the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) efforts to align its services and real property portfolio to meet the needs of veterans. For example, a shift over time from inpatient to outpatient care will likely result in underutilized space once used for inpatient care. Further, the historic status of some VA facilities adds to the complexity of converting or disposing of them. In such instances, it is often difficult and costly for VA to modernize, renovate, and retrofit these older facilities. GAO reported that two of the planning processes VA uses to align its facilities—VA's Strategic Capital Investment Planning (SCIP) and the VA Integrated Planning (VAIP)—have limitations that undermine VA's efforts to achieve its goals. Specifically: VA relies on the SCIP process to plan and prioritize capital projects, but VA routinely asks its facility planners to submit their next year's planned project narratives before knowing if their previous submissions have been funded. The overlapping budget cycle, which is outside of VA's control, combined with other SCIP limitations—including subjective narratives, long time frames, and restricted access to information—make it difficult for VA to rely on SCIP to accurately identify the capital necessary to address its service and infrastructure gaps. VA concurred that it needs to address SCIP limitations that are within its control, as GAO recommended; VA has made some progress in implementing the recommendation has made some progress in implementing the recommendation.\\ The VAIP process is estimated to cost $108 million and to produce market-level service delivery plans and facility master plans. However, the VAIP master plans incorrectly assume that all future growth in services will be provided directly through VA facilities without considering alternatives, such as purchasing care from the community. GAO recommended that VA consider discontinuing the VAIP facility master plans pending an assessment of their value as a facility-planning tool. VA agreed with the recommendation and is implementing it while pursuing a national realignment strategy.. Key elements of the Department of Defense's (DOD) 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process could benefit VA's asset and infrastructure review. The key elements included: (1) establishing goals for the process, (2) developing criteria for evaluating closures and realignments, and (3) establishing an organizational structure to develop closure and realignment options. GAO identified key challenges that affected DOD's implementation of BRAC 2005 and the results achieved; these challenges would need to be addressed if VA is to successfully apply the process. These challenges included: (1) large, complex recommendations required sustained senior leadership's attention and a high level of coordination among many stakeholders, and (2) the large number of actions that depend on each other for successful implementation. In the April 2017 report, GAO made recommendations related to capital planning and stakeholder involvement.

The FCC's mission is to ensure that the American people have access to a rapid, efficient, and affordable communication service. The agency is composed of five commissioners appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, with one member serving as chairman. The FCC has seven bureaus and ten offices that carry out its day-to-day functions, including the Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau, Enforcement Bureau, and Media Bureau. The agency's strategic plan for 2018-2022 outlines four goals: closing the digital divide, promoting innovation, protecting consumers and public safety, and reforming the FCC's processes. The FCC's budget is derived from regulatory fees collected from license holders and other entities, and the agency has requested $335,660,000 in budget authority for FY2020. The FCC has been reauthorized for the first time since 1990, and the agency publishes four periodic reports for Congress, including the Strategic Plan, Performance Budget, Agency Financial Report, and Annual Performance Report. The FCC's regulatory philosophy has evolved over time, with Chairman Tom Wheeler promoting a more regulatory approach and Chairman Ajit Pai advocating for a more market-based approach. The agency's net neutrality rules have been a contentious issue, with Chairman Pai repealing the 2015 Open Internet Order in 2017. The FCC's structure and priorities have changed under Chairman Pai, with a focus on reducing regulatory burdens and promoting market efficiency. The agency's Office of Strategic Planning and Policy Analysis was eliminated and replaced with the Office of Economics and Analytics, reflecting the agency's shift towards a more market-based approach. The FCC's changing regulatory philosophy may continue to drive its long-term strategic goals and decisions. \n\nThe Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that the five selected VA medical centers did not adequately document reviews of providers' clinical care after concerns were raised about their care.

Some regulators seek to protect and benefit the public at large through regulation, while others seek to achieve the same goals through the promotion of market efficiency. Additionally, Congress granted the FCC wide latitude and flexibility to revise its interpretation of the public interest standard to reflect changing circumstances and the agency has not defined it in more concrete terms. These circumstances, paired with changes in FCC leadership, have led to significant changes over time in how the FCC regulates the broadcast and telecommunications industries. The FCC is directed by five commissioners appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate for five-year terms. The President designates one of the commissioners as chairperson. Three commissioners may be members of the same political party of the President and none can have a financial interest in any commission-related business. The current commissioners are Ajit Pai (Chair), Michael O'Rielly, Brendan Carr, Jessica Rosenworcel, and Geoffrey Starks. The day-to-day functions of the FCC are carried out by 7 bureaus and 10 offices. The current basic structure of the FCC was established in 2002 as part of the agency's effort to better reflect the industries it regulates. The seventh bureau, the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau, was established in 2006. The bureaus process applications for licenses and other filings, manage non-federal spectrum, analyze complaints, conduct investigations, develop and implement regulatory programs, and participate in hearings, among other things. The offices provide support services. Bureaus and offices often collaborate when addressing FCC issues. Beginning in the 110th Congress, the FCC has been funded through the House and Senate Financial Services and General Government (FSGG) appropriations bill as a single line item. Previously, it was funded through what is now the Commerce, Justice, Science appropriations bill, also as a single line item. Since 2009 the FCC's budget has been derived from regulatory fees collected by the agency rather than through a direct appropriation. The fees, often referred to as \"Section (9) fees,\" are collected from license holders and certain other entities. The FCC is authorized to review the regulatory fees each year and adjust them to reflect changes in its appropriation from year to year. Most years, appropriations language prohibits the use by the commission of any excess collections received in the current fiscal year or any prior years.

The IA program provides financial and direct assistance to disaster victims for expenses and needs that cannot be met through other means, such as insurance. FEMA evaluates IA declaration requests using six regulatory factors, including concentration of damages, trauma, special populations, voluntary agency assistance, insurance coverage, and average amount of individual assistance by state. However, our analysis of RVARs from July 2012 through December 2016 found that regions did not consistently obtain and document information on all elements of the IA regulatory factors.

When a state, U.S. territory, or tribe requests IA assistance through a federal disaster declaration, FEMA evaluates the request against regulatory factors, such as concentration of damages, and provides a recommendation to the President, who makes a final declaration decision. GAO was asked to review FEMA's IA declaration process. This report examines (1) the number of IA declaration requests received, declared, and denied, and IA actual obligations from calendar years 2008 through 2016, (2) the extent to which FEMA accounts for the regulatory factors when evaluating IA requests, and (3) any challenges FEMA regions and select states reported on the declaration process and factors and any FEMA actions to revise them. GAO reviewed FEMA's policies, IA declaration requests and obligation data, and FEMA's RVARs from July 2012 through December 2016, the most recent years for which data were available. GAO also reviewed proposed rulemaking comments and interviewed FEMA officials from all 10 regions and 11 state emergency management offices selected based on declaration requests and other factors. From calendar years 2008 through 2016, the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Federal Emergency and Management Agency (FEMA) received 294 Individual Assistance (IA) declaration requests from states, U.S. territories, and tribes to help individuals meet their immediate needs after a disaster. Of these, the President declared 168 and denied 126 requests. Across the various types of IA declaration requests, severe storms (190) were the most common disaster type and drought (1) was among the least common. FEMA obligated about $8.6 billion in IA for disaster declarations during this period. GAO found that FEMA regions did not consistently obtain and document information on all elements of established IA regulatory factors when making IA recommendations to headquarters. Following a declaration request, a FEMA region is to prepare a Regional Administrator's Validation and Recommendation (RVAR)—a document designed to include data on each of the six IA regulatory factors for each declaration request as well as the regional administrator's recommendation. GAO reviewed all 81 RVARs from July 2012—the date FEMA began using the new RVAR template—through December 2016. GAO found that regions did not consistently obtain and document information for the elements required under the six regulatory factors (see table). For example, only 44 of the 81 RVARs documented all elements under the concentration of damage factor. By evaluating why regions are not completing all elements of each current IA regulatory factor, FEMA could identify whether any corrective steps are needed. Officials from the 10 FEMA regions and 11 states GAO interviewed, reported positive relationships with each other, but also cited various challenges with the IA declaration process and regulatory factors. For example, these officials told GAO that there are no established minimum thresholds for IA, making final determinations more subjective and the rationale behind denials unclear.

GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care. For example, GAO found that after one VAMC failed to report to the NPDB or SLBs a provider who resigned to avoid an adverse privileging action, a non-VA hospital in the same city took an adverse privileging action against that same provider for the same reason 2 years later."], "length": 5822}

The Hoover Building's original design is inefficient, and much of its space is unusable. The FBI has outgrown the building, and its security concerns have increased since September 11, 2001. The General Services Administration (GSA) has assessed the FBI's facility needs and determined that a new headquarters is necessary. However, the GSA has faced challenges in implementing a swap exchange approach to address the challenges of disposing of unneeded property and modernizing or replacing federal buildings. The GSA has limited experience in successfully completing swap exchange transactions and has cancelled several recently proposed swap exchanges. The GAO recommends that the GSA develop criteria for determining when to solicit market interest in a swap exchange and improve the swap exchange process. The GAO also identifies alternative funding mechanisms, such as public-private partnerships, that can be used to meet real property needs while helping Congress and agencies make more prudent long-term decisions. The GAO suggests that changes to the budgetary structure itself may also help agencies meet their real property needs. Overall, the GAO's report highlights the need for a new FBI headquarters and the challenges in implementing a swap exchange approach to address the challenges of disposing of unneeded property and modernizing or replacing federal buildings. The GAO's recommendations aim to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the GSA's approach to addressing these challenges.", "answers": ["GSA, which manages federal real property on behalf of other federal agencies, faces challenges in funding new construction projects due to budget constraints—including obtaining upfront funding—among other reasons. One type of transaction, called a swap exchange, enables GSA to apply the value of federal property to finance construction without relying on appropriated funds. Under such an exchange, GSA transfers the title of the unneeded property to a private investor after receiving the agreed upon construction services at another location. GSA proposed a swap exchange procurement for construction of a new FBI headquarters building in exchange for the Hoover Building and appropriations to compensate for the difference in value between the Hoover Building and the new building. GSA cancelled this procurement in July 2017 due to lack of funding. This statement addresses (1) GSA's and FBI's assessments of the Hoover Building, (2) GSA efforts to implement swap exchanges, and (3) alternative approaches to funding real property projects. It is based on GAO's body of reports on real property from 2011 to 2017, and selected updates from GSA. In November 2011, GAO reported that, according to General Services Administration (GSA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) assessments, the FBI's headquarters building (Hoover Building) and its accompanying facilities in Washington, D.C., did not fully support the FBI's long-term security, space, and building condition requirements. Since GAO's report, the assessments have not materially changed, for example: Security: GAO's prior work noted that the dispersion of staff in annexes creates security challenges, including where some space was leased by the FBI and other space was leased by nonfederal tenants. Earlier this year, GAO reported the FBI is leasing space in D.C. from foreign owners. Space : In 2011, GAO reported that FBI and GSA studies showed that much of the Hoover Building is unusable. GSA noted in its fiscal year 2017 project prospectus for the FBI headquarters consolidation that the Hoover Building cannot be redeveloped to meet the FBI's current needs. Building Condition: In GAO's 2011 report, GAO noted that the condition of the Hoover Building was deteriorating, and GSA assessments identified significant recapitalization needs. Since GAO's report and in response to GAO's recommendation, GSA has evaluated its approach to maintaining the building and completed some repairs to ensure safety. GSA has limited experience in successfully completing swap exchange transactions and chose not to pursue several proposed swap exchanges, most recently the planned swap exchange for the Hoover Building. GSA has developed criteria for determining when to solicit market interest in a swap exchange, in response to recommendations in GAO's 2014 report. In addition, GSA officials told GAO that they planned to improve the swap exchange process, including the property appraisal process, outreach to stakeholders to identify potential risks associated with future projects, and to the extent possible, mitigate such risks. Nevertheless, several factors may continue to limit use of swap exchanges, including market factors, such as the availability of alternative properties and an investor's approach for valuing properties. For example, in reviewing a proposed swap exchange in Washington, D.C., GAO found in a 2016 report that the proposals from two firms valued the two federal buildings involved in the proposed swap substantially less than GSA's appraised property value. In a 2014 report, GAO identified a number of alternative approaches to funding real property projects. Congress has provided some agencies with specific authorities to use alternative funding mechanisms—including the use of private sector funds or land swaps—for the acquisition, renovation, or disposal of federal real property without full, upfront funding, though GAO has previously reported that upfront funding is the best way to ensure recognition of commitments made in budgeting decisions and maintain fiscal controls. GAO has reported that projects with alternative funding mechanisms present multiple forms of risk that are shared between the agency and any partner or stakeholder. In addition, alternative budgetary structures could be established, such as changing existing or introducing new account structures to fund real property projects. GAO has made recommendations in the past to GSA on various real property issues, including to develop additional guidance for swap exchanges and to evaluate its approach to maintaining the Hoover Building. GSA agreed with these two recommendations and addressed them."], "length": 5546}

The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that the medical centers lacked documentation for almost half of the reviews conducted, and in some cases, the required reviews were not conducted at all. The GAO also found that the medical centers did not always conduct reviews in a timely manner, with some reviews taking multiple years to initiate. The GAO attributed these shortcomings to inadequate VHA policy and oversight. The GAO recommended that VHA require documentation of all reviews, establish a timeliness requirement, and strengthen its oversight to ensure that reviews are conducted and documented in a timely manner. Additionally, the GAO found that the medical centers failed to report providers to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) and state licensing boards as required, which facilitated providers who provided substandard care at one facility obtaining privileges at another VA medical center or at hospitals outside of VA's healthcare system. The GAO recommended that VHA require its networks to establish a process for overseeing VA medical centers to ensure timely reporting to the NPDB and state licensing boards. VA concurred with these recommendations and plans to revise existing policy and update the standardized audit tool to include more comprehensive oversight.

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (VAMC) officials are responsible for reviewing the clinical care delivered by their privileged providers—physicians and dentists who are approved to independently perform specific services—after concerns are raised. The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified.

The agencies have varying authorities to acquire and dispose of land, with the Bureau of Land Management having the broadest authority. The acquisition authorities are designed to allow federal agencies to acquire lands that benefit from federal management, while disposal authorities allow agencies to dispose of land no longer required for federal purposes. The federal government faces questions on the adequacy of existing acquisition and disposal authorities, with Congress considering measures to establish, modify, or eliminate these authorities. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) is the principal financing mechanism for federal land acquisition, with Congress determining the level of appropriations each year. The four federal land management agencies have different standing authorities for acquiring and disposing of lands, with the National Park Service having the narrowest authorities and the Bureau of Land Management having the broadest. The agencies' acquisition and disposal authorities are subject to various laws and regulations, with some authorities allowing for the exchange of lands, sales, or transfers to other entities. The federal government's land ownership and management policies remain controversial, with some advocating for the divestment of federal lands and others supporting the retention of lands in federal ownership. The LWCF has expired, and its reauthorization is a topic of debate, with some proposing permanent reauthorization and others seeking to direct a portion of funding to specific purposes. The federal government's land acquisition and disposal policies are complex and multifaceted, with various laws and regulations governing the agencies' authorities. The Bureau of Land Management has broad authority to acquire and dispose of land, while the National Park Service has limited authority to dispose of land. The U.S. Forest Service has various authorities to acquire and dispose of land, including the Weeks Act of 1911, which allows for the acquisition of lands within or contiguous to national forest boundaries. The Fish and Wildlife Service has various authorities to acquire land, including the Migratory Bird Conservation Act of 1929, which authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to recommend areas for the conservation of migratory birds. The federal government's land ownership and management policies are subject to ongoing debate and consideration by Congress.

Four agencies—the National Park Service (NPS), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in the Department of the Interior, and the U.S. Forest Service (FS) in the Department of Agriculture—administer about 95% of those lands. The extent to which each of these four federal agencies have authority to acquire and dispose of land varies considerably. The BLM has relatively broad authority for both acquisitions and disposals under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA). The agency also has other authorities for disposing of land, including two laws that allow the agency to retain the proceeds for subsequent land acquisition, among other purposes, and a law that allows transfers to governmental units and other entities for public purposes. By contrast, the NPS has no general authority to acquire land to create new park units or to dispose of park lands. The FS authority to acquire lands is mostly limited to lands within or contiguous to the boundaries of a national forest. The agency has various authorities to dispose of land, but they are relatively constrained and infrequently used. The FWS has various authorities to acquire lands but no general authority to dispose of its lands. The agency frequently uses acquisition authority under the Migratory Bird Conservation Act of 1929 because of the availability of funding through the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund. The nature of the acquisition and disposal authorities of the four federal agencies also varies. In general, the acquisition authorities are designed to allow the four agencies to bring into federal ownership lands that many contend could benefit from federal management. Disposal authorities generally are designed to allow agencies to convey land that is no longer needed for a federal purpose or that might be chiefly valuable for another purpose. Some of the authorities specify particular circumstances where they can be used, such as the conveyance of FS land for educational purposes and the disposal of BLM land for recreation and public purposes. Congress often faces questions on the adequacy of existing acquisition and disposal authorities; the nature, extent, and location of their use; and the extent of federal land ownership overall. The current acquisition and disposal authorities form the backdrop for consideration of measures to establish, modify, or eliminate authorities, or to provide for the acquisition or disposal of particular lands. In some cases, Congress enacts bills to provide authority to acquire or dispose of particular parcels where no standing authority exists and, in other cases, to direct or facilitate land transactions. Congress also addresses acquisition and disposal policy in the context of debates on the role and goals of the federal government in owning and managing land generally, and it has considered broader measures to dispose of lands or to promote acquisition. Other issues for Congress pertain to the sources and levels of funds for land acquisition. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) is the primary source of funding for land acquisition. Congress has considered diverse measures related to the LWCF, such as legislation to make LWCF funding permanent and bills to direct LWCF monies to additional, nonacquisition purposes. Additionally, the FWS has the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund, an account with mandatory spending authority supported by revenue from three sources.

{"pred": " Passage 1\nThe House of Representatives has a procedure called suspension of the rules, which allows nonprivileged measures to be raised without a special rule, waives points of order, limits debate, and prohibits floor amendments. This procedure is typically reserved for bills and resolutions that can meet a supermajority threshold, requiring a two-thirds vote for passage. In the 114th Congress, 62% of all measures that received floor action were considered under suspension, with most being bills sponsored by members of the majority party. Suspension measures are not subject to floor amendments, but committees may recommend amendments during markup meetings or through informal negotiations. The motion to suspend the rules can include these proposed changes when a Member moves to suspend the rules and pass the measure \"as amended.\" In the 114th Congress, 396 suspension measures (53% of the total) were considered \"as amended,\" meaning that the text to be approved differed from the measure's introduced text. The suspension procedure is established by clause 1 of House Rule XV, and motions to suspend the rules are regularly in order on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays or on the last six days of a session of Congress. The procedure is used to consider a wide range of policy areas, but most often addresses government operations, such as the designation of federal facilities. The House may consider the measure again under suspension or the Committee on Rules may report a special rule that provides for floor consideration of the measure if the vote falls short of the two-thirds required for passage. In the 114th Congress, the House passed 612 of the 619 House bills that were initially considered under suspension, with most suspension motions being agreed to in the House by voice vote. The Senate passed 197 of the 619 House bills initially considered under suspension, and 60 required a resolution of differences between the chambers. The President vetoed two measures, and the House chose not to attempt a veto override on one of them, while the Senate and House voted to override the veto of the other. In total, 193 House bills, 82 Senate bills, and 1 House joint resolution became public law. The suspension procedure is an important tool for the House of Representatives to consider and pass legislation, and it is used to address a wide range of policy areas. The procedure is subject to certain rules and limitations, but it provides a way for the House to consider and pass legislation that may not be privileged for consideration. The key evidence presented in the passage includes the data on the number of measures considered under suspension", "answers": ["Suspension of the rules is the most commonly used procedure to call up measures on the floor of the House of Representatives. As the name suggests, the procedure allows the House to suspend its standing and statutory rules in order to consider broadly supported legislation in an expedited manner. More specifically, the House temporarily sets aside its rules that govern the raising and consideration of measures and assumes a new set of constraints particular to the suspension procedure. The suspension of the rules procedure has several parliamentary advantages: (1) it allows nonprivileged measures to be raised on the House floor without the need for a special rule, (2) it enables the consideration of measures that would otherwise be subject to a point of order, and (3) it streamlines floor action by limiting debate and prohibiting floor amendments. Given these features, as well as the required two-thirds supermajority vote for passage, suspension motions are generally used to process less controversial legislation. In the 114th Congress (2015-2016), measures considered under suspension made up 62% of the bills and resolutions that received floor action in the House (743 out of 1,200 measures). The majority of suspension measures were House bills (83%), followed by Senate bills (11%) and House resolutions (4%). The measures covered a variety of policy areas but most often addressed government operations, such as the designation of federal facilities or amending administrative policies. Most measures that are considered in the House under the suspension procedure are sponsored by a House or Senate majority party member. However, suspension is the most common House procedure used to consider minority-party-sponsored legislation regardless of whether the legislation originated in the House or Senate. In 2015 and 2016, minority-party members sponsored 31% of suspension measures, compared to 9% of legislation subject to different procedures, including privileged business (17 measures), unanimous consent (21 measures), and under the terms of a special rule (one Senate bill). Most suspension measures are referred to at least one House committee before their consideration on the floor. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform (now called the Committee on Oversight and Reform) was the committee of primary jurisdiction for the plurality of suspension measures considered in the 114th Congress. Additional committees—such as Energy and Commerce, Homeland Security, Natural Resources, Foreign Affairs, and Veterans' Affairs—also served as the primary committee for a large number of suspension measures. Suspension motions are debatable for up to 40 minutes. In most cases, only a fraction of that debate time is actually used. In the 114th Congress, the average amount of time spent considering a motion to suspend the rules was 13 minutes and 10 seconds. The House adopted nearly every suspension motion considered in 2015 and 2016. Approval by the House, however, did not guarantee final approval in the 114th Congress. The Senate passed or agreed to 40% of the bills, joint resolutions, and concurrent resolutions initially considered in the House under suspension of the rules, and 276 measures were signed into law. This report briefly describes the suspension of the rules procedure, which is defined in House Rule XV, and provides an analysis of measures considered under this procedure during the 114th Congress. Figures and one table display statistics on the use of the procedure, including the prevalence and form of suspension measures, sponsorship of measures by party, committee consideration, length of debate, voting, resolution of differences between the chambers, and the final status of legislation. In addition, an Appendix illustrates trends in the use of the suspension procedure from the 110th to the 114th Congress (2007-2016)."], "length": 6875}

Many fees stem from \"business-like activities,\" in which the government provides a service or benefit in return for payment. For example, many national parks charge entry fees, which then help fund maintenance projects. Such fees and charges that result from voluntary choices, such as entering a national park, are distinguished from taxes—which stem from the government's sovereign power to compel payments. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) defines a user fee as a \"fee assessed to users for goods or services provided by the federal government. User fees generally apply to federal programs or activities that provide special benefits to identifiable recipients above and beyond what is normally available to the public.\" User fees and charges have several advantages as a means of financing public activities. They are voluntary, they connect the burden of financing activities to those who directly benefit from them, and can help decentralize decisionmaking by bypassing centralized allocation of resources. Some have expressed concerns that user fee arrangements may bypass regular congressional scrutiny and dilute Congress's power of the purse. Collections of fees and charges may also be more sensitive to economic fluctuations, which could complicate financing of programs dependent on those revenue streams. Many user fees or charges are classified as offsetting collections, which are deposited into expenditure accounts. Offsetting collections can be used to offset agency spending and typically require no further congressional approval to use. Other fees and charges are classified as offsetting receipts, which are collected into revenue accounts and typically require congressional authorization to be spent. User fees and charges can be classified as discretionary or mandatory spending, depending on how they are legally authorized. The levels and administration of some fees are specified in detailed statutory text, while other fees are created under broader agency authorities. Certain agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), have increased their reliance on user fees in past decades. Some critics have raised concerns that increased reliance on user fees could shift incentives facing those agencies. Some legislative proposals, such as H.R. 850 introduced in the 115th Congress, would limit or eliminate most exceptions and require most fees and charges to be deposited in the U.S. Treasury General Fund. Congress could fund agencies and activities now funded in whole or in part via user fees directly through the annual appropriations process. Such proposals would mark a departure from past practice. Statutory text governing many fees has evolved over many years and involves substantive policy decisions, often related to the industry or programmatic concerns. A general change in funding from user fees and charges to annual appropriations would likely shift the division of responsibilities between authorizing committees and appropriations committees. Congress may also enhance its oversight of agencies reliant on user fees by requiring more timely and detailed financial reports as well as more precise and systematic explanations of linkages between those fees and associated programs. Congress could also ask for greater transparency in fiscal data. While the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the U.S. Treasury Bureau of the Fiscal Service provide extensive data on user fees and charges, it is difficult to conduct governmentwide analyses using publicly available sources. Congress could mandate more detailed and more easily accessed data on user fees and charges. Additional funding may be needed to develop the capacity to issue those data."], "length": 6942}

{"pred": " \nThe Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant is a federal program that provides financial assistance to low-income families. The program has undergone significant changes since its inception in 1996, with the block grant amount remaining the same from FY1997 to FY2016, despite inflation and changes in the poverty population. The real value of the block grant declined by one-third (33.1%) during this period. In FY2017, the state family assistance grant was reduced by 0.33% to finance TANF-related research and technical assistance. The program is funded through a combination of federal and state funds, with states required to expend a minimum amount of their own funds for TANF and TANF-related activities under the maintenance of effort (MOE) requirement. The MOE amount is $10.3 billion per year for the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the territories. The program has undergone significant changes in its use of funds, with basic assistance representing 23% of total TANF and MOE dollars in FY2017, followed by child care funding, TANF work-related activities, and refundable tax credits. The program also helps fund state prekindergarten (pre-K) programs and provides short-term and emergency benefits and a wide range of other social services. The number of families receiving TANF assistance has declined significantly since the program's inception, with 1.2 million families receiving assistance in September 2018. The composition of the assistance caseload has also changed, with a decline in families headed by unemployed adult recipients and an increase in families with employed adults and \"child-only\" families. The maximum monthly TANF cash benefit varies by state, with the lowest benefit amount in Mississippi and the highest in New Hampshire. The program's work participation standards require states to have 50% of their caseload meet standards of participation in work or activities, with a separate participation standard for the two-parent portion of the caseload. States that do not meet the TANF work participation standard are at risk of being penalized through a reduction in their block grant. The national average all-families work participation rate has increased since FY2002, with 16 states not meeting the all-families standard in FY2012. The two-parent work participation standard requires states to have 90% of their two-parent caseload meet participation standards, with 9 states not meeting this standard in FY2017.

TANF was created in the 1996 welfare reform law (P.L. 104-193). This report responds to some frequently asked questions about TANF; it does not describe TANF rules (see, instead, CRS Report RL32748, The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Block Grant: A Primer on TANF Financing and Federal Requirements, by Gene Falk). TANF Funding and Expenditures. TANF provides fixed funding for the 50 states, the District of Columbia, the territories, and American Indian tribes. The basic block grant totals $16.5 billion per year. States are also required in total to contribute, from their own funds, at least $10.3 billion annually under a maintenance-of-effort (MOE) requirement. Though TANF is best known for funding cash assistance payments for needy families with children, the block grant and MOE funds are used for a wide variety of benefits and activities. In FY2017, expenditures on basic assistance totaled $7.1 billion—23% of total federal TANF and MOE dollars. Basic assistance is often—but not exclusively—paid as cash. In addition to funding basic assistance, TANF also contributes funds for child care and services for children who have been, or are at risk of being, abused and neglected. Some states also count expenditures in prekindergarten programs toward the MOE requirement. The TANF Assistance Caseload. A total of 1.2 million families, composed of 3.1 million recipients, received TANF- or MOE-funded assistance in September 2018. The bulk of the \"recipients\" were children—2.3 million in that month. The assistance caseload is heterogeneous. The type of family once thought of as the \"typical\" assistance family—one with an unemployed adult recipient—accounted for 32% of all families on the rolls in FY2016. Additionally, 31% of cash assistance families had an employed adult, while 38% of all TANF families were \"child-only\" and had no adult recipient. Child-only families include those with disabled adults receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI), adults who are nonparents (e.g., grandparents, aunts, uncles) caring for children, and families consisting of citizen children and ineligible noncitizen parents. Cash Assistance Benefits. TANF cash benefit amounts are set by states. In July 2017, the maximum monthly benefit for a family of three ranged from $1,021 in New Hampshire to $170 in Mississippi. Only New Hampshire (at 60% of the federal poverty guidelines) had a maximum TANF cash assistance amount for this sized family in excess of 50% of poverty-level income. Work Requirements. TANF's main federal work requirement is actually a performance measure that applies to the states. States determine the work rules that apply to individual recipients. TANF law requires states to engage 50% of all families and 90% of two-parent families with work-eligible individuals in work activities, though these standards can be reduced by \"credits.\" Therefore, the effective standards states face are often less than the 50% or 90% targets, and vary by state. In FY2017, states achieved, on average, an all-family participation rate of 53.0% and a two-parent rate of 69.5%. In FY2017, two jurisdictions did not meet the all-family participation standard: Nevada and Guam. This is a reduction from FY2012, when 16 states did not meet that standard. In FY2017, nine jurisdictions did not meet the two-parent standard. States that do not meet work standards are at risk of being penalized by a reduction in their block grant."], "length": 6888}

The Navy has been experiencing persistent maintenance, training, and other challenges that affect its readiness. The GAO found that the Navy's ships are being deployed for longer periods, which has resulted in a decline in the material condition of the ships. The Navy has also been experiencing difficulties in completing maintenance on time, with only 28% of scheduled maintenance for surface combatants completed on time in 2011-2014. The GAO also found that the Navy's shipyards are facing capacity limitations and poor conditions that affect their operation. The GAO recommended that the Navy reassess its manpower requirements, develop a comprehensive assessment of the long-term costs and risks associated with overseas homeporting, and improve its management of capital investment in the shipyards. The Navy has not yet implemented these recommendations.\n\nIn another investigation, the GAO found that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers were not adequately documenting and conducting reviews of providers' clinical care after concerns were raised about their care. The GAO found that the VA medical centers lacked documentation showing that reviews had been conducted for 26 providers, and that 16 providers had not had reviews initiated for 3 months or more after concerns were raised about their care. The GAO also found that the VA medical centers were not reporting providers to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) and state licensing boards as required.

However, the PERM methodology has limitations, particularly in measuring program integrity risks in Medicaid managed care. The PERM does not account for overpayments and unallowable costs, which are significant risks in managed care. Audits and investigations have identified millions of dollars in overpayments and unallowable costs in Medicaid managed care programs, but these are not captured in the PERM. CMS has taken steps to improve oversight of Medicaid managed care, but these efforts fall short of ensuring that the agency and states can identify and address overpayments and unallowable costs. The GAO recommends that CMS consider revising the PERM methodology or focusing additional audit resources on managed care to better measure program integrity risks. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) concurred with the recommendation, but noted that the PERM is not intended to measure all Medicaid program integrity risks. The GAO maintains that the PERM likely underestimates program integrity risks in Medicaid managed care and that better information is needed to ensure the integrity of the Medicaid program.

CMS and the states oversee Medicaid, whose size, structure, and diversity make it vulnerable to improper payments. CMS estimates the Medicaid improper payment rate annually through its PERM, which includes an estimate for Medicaid managed care, in which states contract with MCOs to provide services to Medicaid enrollees. GAO was asked to study the PERM methodology for managed care. In this report, GAO examined the extent to which the PERM accounts for program integrity risks in Medicaid managed care, including CMS's and states' oversight. GAO identified program integrity risks reported in 27 federal and state audits and investigations issued between January 2012 and September 2017; reviewed federal regulations and guidance on the PERM and CMS's Focused Program Integrity Reviews; and contacted program integrity officials in the 16 states with a majority of 2016 Medicaid spending for managed care, as well as CMS officials and program integrity experts. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) estimate of improper payments for Medicaid managed care has limitations that are not mitigated by the agency's and states' current oversight efforts. One component of the Payment Error Rate Measurement (PERM) measures the accuracy of capitated payments, which are periodic payments that state Medicaid agencies make to managed care organizations (MCO) to provide services to enrollees and to cover other allowable costs, such as administrative expenses. However, the managed care component of the PERM neither includes a medical review of services delivered to enrollees, nor reviews of MCO records or data. Further, GAO's review of the 27 federal and state audits and investigations identified key program risks. Ten of the 27 federal and state audits and investigations identified about $68 million in overpayments and unallowable MCO costs that were not accounted for by PERM estimates; another of these investigations resulted in a $137.5 million settlement. These audits and investigations were conducted over more than 5 years and involved a small fraction of the more than 270 MCOs operating nationwide as of September 2017. To the extent that overpayments and unallowable costs are unidentified and not removed from the cost data used to set capitation rates, they may allow inflated MCO payments and minimize the appearance of program risks in Medicaid managed care. CMS and states have taken steps to improve oversight of Medicaid managed care through updated regulations, focused reviews of states' managed care programs, and federal program integrity contractors' audits of managed care services. However, some of these efforts went into effect only recently, and others are unlikely to address the risks in managed care across all states. Furthermore, these efforts do not ensure the identification and reporting of overpayments to providers and unallowable costs by MCOs. Federal internal control standards call for agency management to identify and respond to risks. Without addressing key risks, such as the extent of overpayments and unallowable costs, CMS cannot be certain that its estimated improper payment rate for managed care (0.3 percent compared with 12.9 percent in Medicaid fee-for-service) accurately reflects program risks. The Administrator of CMS should consider and take steps to mitigate the program risks that are not measured in the PERM, such as overpayments and unallowable costs; such an effort could include actions such as revising the PERM methodology or focusing additional audit resources on managed care.

The method also involves generating virtual 2D angiography recordings from the results of the CFD simulation, determining a degree of correspondence between the real and virtual 2D angiography recordings, and comparing the degree of correspondence with predefinable tolerance values. The method enables the CFD simulation results to be validated for the individual patient, or any deviations to be quantitatively determined and used iteratively to improve the CFD simulation. The degree of correspondence is a two-dimensional field that can be represented as an image and permits an evaluation of the correspondence between the virtual and the real angiography.

Despite the challenges in accurately estimating cancer risks from very low doses of radiation exposure, NRC officials stated that they will continue to follow the recommendations of scientific advisory bodies to use the linear no-threshold model. The federal agencies have developed and applied various limits on dose or increased health risk and guidance levels on exposure, depending on the settings in which exposure can occur. For example, NRC has established limits on occupational dose that apply to nuclear power-plant workers, while FDA regulates the maximum radiation output of medical equipment. From fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2016, seven federal agencies obligated $209.6 million for research on the health effects of low-dose radiation, but they did not use a collaborative mechanism to address overall research priorities in this area. The DOE has funded research on the health effects of low-dose radiation, including radiobiological and epidemiological studies, but the agency reduced its annual funding obligations for this area of research by 45 percent from fiscal year 2012 to fiscal year 2016. The GAO recommended that the Secretary of Energy lead the development of a mechanism for interagency collaboration to determine roles and responsibilities for addressing priorities related to research on the health effects of low-dose radiation. However, DOE did not agree with this recommendation, stating that EPA and NRC also have legal mandates to research low-dose radiation exposure and that these agencies establish their research priorities in accordance with their respective budget authorities and recommendations from independent advisory bodies. The GAO believes that DOE is in the best position to lead agencies in developing the most appropriate mechanism for interagency collaboration.

The Department of Energy (DOE), Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Food and Drug Administration generally used the advice of scientific advisory bodies to develop and apply radiation protection requirements and guidance for workers and the public in the radiation exposure settings that GAO reviewed. These settings were: (1) the operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants; (2) the cleanup of sites with radiological contamination; (3) the use of medical equipment that produces radiation; and (4) accidental or terrorism-related exposure to radiation. Specifically, the agencies relied on the advice of three scientific advisory bodies that supported the use of a model that assumes the risk of cancer increases with every incremental radiation exposure. Accordingly, the agencies have set regulatory dose limits and issued guidance to confine exposure to levels that reduce the risk of cancer, while recognizing that scientific uncertainties occur in estimating cancer risks from low-dose radiation. For example, NRC requires nuclear power plants to consider measures for limiting workers' exposure below NRC's regulatory dose limit, such as by using robots for maintenance work in radiation areas. GAO identified seven federal agencies that funded research on low-dose radiation's health effects. In fiscal years 2012 to 2016, DOE, NRC, EPA, and four other federal agencies obligated about $210 million for such research . Although the agencies have collaborated on individual projects on radiation's health effects, they have not established a collaborative mechanism to set research priorities. GAO's previous work has shown that federal agencies can use such mechanisms to implement interagency collaboration to develop and coordinate sound science policies. In the past, DOE took a leading role in this area because DOE provided stable funding and advocated for greater coordination on research on low-dose radiation's health effects. However, since fiscal year 2012, DOE has phased out funding for one of its main research programs in this area. This has created a void in coordination efforts among federal agencies, and no other agency has stepped forward to fill this void. Because of DOE's prior experience as a leader in this area of research and its research responsibility under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, it could play an important role in helping federal agencies establish a coordinating mechanism for low-dose radiation research.

The NRC has set dose limits for radiation exposure that are below the level considered low dose by the National Academies, and has applied the principle that doses should be kept as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA). However, there is uncertainty about the health effects of low-dose radiation, and further research is needed to reduce uncertainty in predicting cancer risk. The seven federal agencies that funded research on health effects of low-dose radiation collectively decreased their annual funding obligations in this area by 48% from fiscal year 2012 to fiscal year 2016.

As the name suggests, the procedure allows the House to suspend its standing and statutory rules in order to consider broadly supported legislation in an expedited manner. More specifically, the House temporarily sets aside its rules that govern the raising and consideration of measures and assumes a new set of constraints particular to the suspension procedure. The suspension of the rules procedure has several parliamentary advantages: (1) it allows nonprivileged measures to be raised on the House floor without the need for a special rule, (2) it enables the consideration of measures that would otherwise be subject to a point of order, and (3) it streamlines floor action by limiting debate and prohibiting floor amendments. Given these features, as well as the required two-thirds supermajority vote for passage, suspension motions are generally used to process less controversial legislation. In the 114th Congress (2015-2016), measures considered under suspension made up 62% of the bills and resolutions that received floor action in the House (743 out of 1,200 measures). The majority of suspension measures were House bills (83%), followed by Senate bills (11%) and House resolutions (4%). The measures covered a variety of policy areas but most often addressed government operations, such as the designation of federal facilities or amending administrative policies. Most measures that are considered in the House under the suspension procedure are sponsored by a House or Senate majority party member. However, suspension is the most common House procedure used to consider minority-party-sponsored legislation regardless of whether the legislation originated in the House or Senate. In 2015 and 2016, minority-party members sponsored 31% of suspension measures, compared to 9% of legislation subject to different procedures, including privileged business (17 measures), unanimous consent (21 measures), and under the terms of a special rule (one Senate bill). Most suspension measures are referred to at least one House committee before their consideration on the floor. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform (now called the Committee on Oversight and Reform) was the committee of primary jurisdiction for the plurality of suspension measures considered in the 114th Congress. Additional committees—such as Energy and Commerce, Homeland Security, Natural Resources, Foreign Affairs, and Veterans' Affairs—also served as the primary committee for a large number of suspension measures. Suspension motions are debatable for up to 40 minutes. In most cases, only a fraction of that debate time is actually used. In the 114th Congress, the average amount of time spent considering a motion to suspend the rules was 13 minutes and 10 seconds.

The review found that the medical centers lacked documentation for almost half of the reviews conducted, and in some cases, the required reviews were not conducted at all. The main argument is that the VA's oversight of clinical care reviews is inadequate, leading to a lack of assurance that providers who provide substandard care are reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) and state licensing boards. The key evidence presented includes the lack of documentation for 26 providers who required focused professional practice evaluations (FPPEs) for cause, and the failure to report nine providers to the NPDB and state licensing boards as required. The review also found that VHA policy does not require documentation of all types of reviews, and that the networks do not oversee whether VA medical centers are reporting providers to the NPDB and state licensing boards.

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (VAMC) officials are responsible for reviewing the clinical care delivered by their privileged providers—physicians and dentists who are approved to independently perform specific services—after concerns are raised. The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care.

The inventors found that grinding JM216 powder with β-cyclodextrin or certain polymers, such as gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidinone, or hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, can convert the drug to an amorphous state, significantly increasing its water solubility. The preferred formulations with increased solubility are those where the JM216 is ground to an amorphous state in the following drug:β-cyclodextrin or drug:polymer ratios: JM216:gelatin in ratios of from about 1:4 to about 1:9 (w/w); JM216:HPMC in a 1:9 (w/w) ratio; JM216:PVP in a 1:9 (w/w) ratio; and JM216:β-cyclodextrin in a 1:9 (w/w) ratio. The inventors also developed a suppository dosage form of JM216, which can provide an alternative dosage form for patients unable to use the current oral capsules. The suppository formulation is prepared by mixing JM216 with a PEG suppository base, a fatty acid, and a surface active agent. The fatty acid is used in an amount of from 0.5 to 10% (w/w) of the total suppository weight, and the surface active agent is employed in an amount of from 0.5 to 7% of the total suppository weight. The inventors found that the addition of certain fatty acids to the PEG suppository base containing non-amorphous JM216 gave the desired absorption levels, while similar PEG formulations without these fatty acids were unacceptable. The amorphous JM216 produced by grinding or milling JM216 with β-cyclodextrin or polymers, particularly gelatin, HPMC or PVP, can also be added to a PEG suppository base and certain fatty acids to obtain a suppository dosage form having excellent absorption properties. The inventors determined that in the rat rectum absorption model, a percentage absorption of 4% or greater was considered necessary for a commercially useful suppository formulation of JM216.

This report examines (1) guidance select U.S. agencies have issued to implement these restrictions, (2) whether overseas officials from select U.S. agencies were aware of the restrictions and guidance, and (3) select U.S. agencies' implementation of the guidance overseas. GAO reviewed U.S. laws, agency guidance, and internal communications; analyzed Commerce data; and interviewed agency officials in Washington, D.C. and in 24 offices across 11 overseas posts in 9 countries. GAO selected these countries based on criteria that included U.S. tobacco export totals, smoking rates, and geographic dispersion. Congress has restricted the use of certain appropriated funding to promote tobacco exports and the Departments of State (State), Commerce (Commerce), and Agriculture (USDA) have issued interagency guidance through the cable system that they rely on to implement these restrictions.

The acquisition authorities are designed to allow federal agencies to acquire lands that benefit from federal management, while disposal authorities allow agencies to dispose of land no longer required for federal purposes. The federal government faces questions on the adequacy of existing acquisition and disposal authorities, with Congress considering measures to establish, modify, or eliminate these authorities. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) is the principal financing mechanism for federal land acquisition, with Congress determining the level of appropriations each year. The four federal land management agencies have different standing authorities for acquiring and disposing of lands, with the National Park Service having the narrowest authorities and the Bureau of Land Management having the broadest. The agencies' acquisition and disposal authorities are subject to various laws and regulations, with some authorities allowing for the exchange of lands, sales, or transfers to other entities. The federal government's land ownership and management policies remain controversial, with some advocating for the divestment of federal lands and others supporting the retention of lands in federal ownership.

The extent to which each of these four federal agencies have authority to acquire and dispose of land varies considerably. The BLM has relatively broad authority for both acquisitions and disposals under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA). The agency also has other authorities for disposing of land, including two laws that allow the agency to retain the proceeds for subsequent land acquisition, among other purposes, and a law that allows transfers to governmental units and other entities for public purposes. By contrast, the NPS has no general authority to acquire land to create new park units or to dispose of park lands. The FS authority to acquire lands is mostly limited to lands within or contiguous to the boundaries of a national forest. The agency has various authorities to dispose of land, but they are relatively constrained and infrequently used. The FWS has various authorities to acquire lands but no general authority to dispose of its lands. The agency frequently uses acquisition authority under the Migratory Bird Conservation Act of 1929 because of the availability of funding through the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund. The nature of the acquisition and disposal authorities of the four federal agencies also varies. In general, the acquisition authorities are designed to allow the four agencies to bring into federal ownership lands that many contend could benefit from federal management. Disposal authorities generally are designed to allow agencies to convey land that is no longer needed for a federal purpose or that might be chiefly valuable for another purpose. Some of the authorities specify particular circumstances where they can be used, such as the conveyance of FS land for educational purposes and the disposal of BLM land for recreation and public purposes. Congress often faces questions on the adequacy of existing acquisition and disposal authorities; the nature, extent, and location of their use; and the extent of federal land ownership overall. The current acquisition and disposal authorities form the backdrop for consideration of measures to establish, modify, or eliminate authorities, or to provide for the acquisition or disposal of particular lands. In some cases, Congress enacts bills to provide authority to acquire or dispose of particular parcels where no standing authority exists and, in other cases, to direct or facilitate land transactions. Congress also addresses acquisition and disposal policy in the context of debates on the role and goals of the federal government in owning and managing land generally, and it has considered broader measures to dispose of lands or to promote acquisition. Other issues for Congress pertain to the sources and levels of funds for land acquisition. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) is the primary source of funding for land acquisition.

Since then, the eligibility criteria for the Purple Heart have been expanded several times, including in 1942, 1952, 1962, and 1996. The most recent expansion of eligibility occurred in 2015, when Congress passed the National Defense Authorization Act, which redefined what constitutes an attack by a foreign terrorist organization and allowed for the award of Purple Hearts to servicemembers who were wounded or killed in such attacks. The debate over Purple Heart eligibility continues, with some arguing that mental injuries such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) should be eligible for the award, while others believe that it would dishonor those who have received Purple Hearts for physical injuries. The Department of Defense is currently reevaluating Purple Heart eligibility for traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and mental conditions such as PTSD. The National Alliance on Mental Illness is advocating for the Purple Heart to be awarded for psychological wounds including PTSD to eliminate stigma and encourage servicemembers to seek care. The Military Order of the Purple Heart and Veterans of Foreign Wars are resistant to accepting PTSD as grounds for eligibility, arguing that medals are not awarded for illness or disease, but for achievement and valor.

{"pred": " \nThe United States Postal Service (USPS) has seen significant growth in its competitive products, with revenue increasing from 10% to 28% of all USPS mail revenues between 2008 and 2017. This growth is expected to continue due to the rise of e-commerce, with USPS forecasting increased competition in the first- and last-mile delivery services. To remain competitive, USPS has implemented various measures, including leveraging automation and passive and active scan technology to capture barcode information and provide real-time visibility for customers. However, despite these efforts, instances of missed or inaccurate scans still occur, with the USPS Office of Inspector General (OIG) finding that 0.1% of delivery scans were improper in 2017. The OIG has also found that USPS employees at some facilities did not follow correct scanning procedures, leading to inconsistent counts for certain products. To address these issues, the USPS has taken steps to update its scanning devices and provide additional training to employees. However, the USPS lacks detailed and up-to-date standard operating procedures for scanning, which can make it difficult for managers to investigate and resolve scanning issues. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommends that the Postmaster General identify and adopt a set of internal control standards for operational internal control activities, improve the communication of standard operating procedures for scanning, and create standard operating procedures for managers on how to address inaccurate scans and use available reports to investigate and resolve scanning issues. The USPS has agreed to conduct a cost study to determine whether to commit resources to identifying and adopting a set of internal control standards for its operational internal control activities.

USPS scans these packages at various points throughout the postal network. When scans are inaccurate or missing, questions are raised about the veracity of USPS's data on scanning performance and can lead to customer complaints. GAO was asked to review USPS's scanning policies and procedures. In this report, GAO (1) describes USPS's scanning performance and (2) examines how USPS ensures accurate scanning. GAO reviewed USPS's policies and procedures and assessed them against internal control standards; interviewed officials from USPS and five high-volume mailers; and conducted site visits to six post offices in two USPS districts that represented a range of volume, number of routes, and performance. Mail products over which the United States Postal Service (USPS) does not exercise market dominance, such as many of its packages, are called competitive products. These items are scanned throughout the mail delivery system to track their progress (see figure). USPS data show that these products are almost always scanned. For example, USPS data showed that for the first three quarters of fiscal year 2018; all but one of USPS's 67 districts met their scanning goals. Additionally, mailers that account for a high volume of USPS's competitive products told GAO that they believed USPS was generally scanning products correctly. However, a small percentage of missed or inaccurate scans occur. For example, a report from one USPS district showed that for one week, 0.73 percent of the products delivered were missing a scan and that for the fiscal year to date almost 155,000 competitive products were missing a delivery scan. USPS has designed and implemented procedures and activities to help ensure accurate scanning, but some limitations could contribute to scanning errors. For example, USPS has not based its operational procedures for scanning on any internal control standards. USPS officials said the procedures were based on USPS's unique responsibilities, management experience, and sound business practices, but the officials could not identify specific standards or a framework that they followed as the basis for the procedures. USPS officials said they did not believe any internal controls standards applied to these procedures. By not basing procedures on standards, USPS may miss opportunities to improve how it achieves its mission to scan and measure the performance of competitive products. Additionally, USPS's scanning procedure documents, such as for outlining specific delivery scanning steps, are not always consistent, and USPS relies on more informal methods, such as meetings with employees to communicate changes. Thus, employees may not have accurate procedures available to them. Finally, USPS lacks procedures to help managers identify and address incorrect scans, address customer complaints or otherwise address scanning irregularities. For example, USPS's guidance for managers is limited to a list of bullet-points that do not detail the steps managers should follow to resolve scanning irregularities. In addition, this list has not been updated since 2005. Without consistent or detailed procedures, USPS's employees and managers may not scan items accurately or find information needed to resolve scanning issues—a situation that could hinder USPS's ability to reduce inaccurate or missing scans for these important mail products. GAO recommends that USPS: (1) identify and adopt internal control standards for its operational activities such as for scanning of competitive products; (2) improve the communication of procedures for scanning competitive products; and, (3) create procedures for supervisors on how to address inaccurate scans and resolve scanning issues.

The United States is the largest contributor of funding and personnel to Resolute Support, providing and maintaining ANDSF equipment, along with training, advising, and assistance to help the ANDSF effectively use and sustain the equipment in the future. House Report 114-537 included a provision for GAO to review the ANDSF's capability and capacity to operate and sustain U.S.-purchased weapon systems and equipment. This report addresses (1) what has been reported about ANDSF capabilities and capability gaps and (2) the extent to which DOD has information about the ANDSF's ability to operate and maintain U.S.-purchased equipment. To conduct this work, GAO analyzed DOD and NATO reports and documents, examined three critical equipment types, and interviewed DOD officials in the United States and Afghanistan. This is a public version of a sensitive report issued in September 2018. Information that DOD deemed sensitive has been omitted. Since the Resolute Support mission began in 2015, the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) have improved some fundamental capabilities, such as high-level operational planning, but continue to rely on U.S. and coalition support to fill several key capability gaps, according to Department of Defense (DOD) reporting. DOD has initiatives to address some ANDSF capability gaps, such as a country-wide vehicle maintenance and training effort, but DOD reports it does not expect the ANDSF to develop and sustain independent capabilities in some areas, such as logistics, for several years. While DOD has firsthand information on the abilities of the Afghan Air Force and Special Security Forces to operate and maintain U.S.-purchased equipment, it has little reliable information on the equipment proficiency of conventional ANDSF units. U.S. and coalition advisors are embedded at the tactical level for the Air Force and Special Security Forces, enabling DOD to directly assess those forces' abilities. However, the advisors have little direct contact with conventional ANDSF units on the front lines. As a result, DOD relies on those units' self-assessments of tactical abilities, which, according to DOD officials, can be unreliable. GAO's analysis of three critical equipment types illustrated the varying degrees of DOD's information (see figure above). For example, DOD provided detailed information about the Air Force's ability to operate and maintain MD-530 helicopters and the Special Security Forces' ability to operate and maintain Mobile Strike Force Vehicles; however, DOD had limited information about how conventional forces operate and maintain radios and Mobile Strike Force Vehicles. DOD's lack of reliable information on conventional forces' equipment operations and maintenance abilities adds to the uncertainty and risk in assessing the progress of DOD efforts in Afghanistan. GAO recommends that DOD develop options for collecting reliable information on conventional ANDSF units' ability to operate and maintain U.S.-purchased equipment.

The UI system is financed by federal taxes under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) and by state payroll taxes under each state's State Unemployment Tax Act (SUTA). The UI system has several programs, including the Unemployment Compensation (UC) program, which provides up to 26 weeks of income support through regular UC benefit payments. The Extended Benefit (EB) program may extend UC benefits for up to 13 weeks or 20 weeks if certain economic situations exist within the state. However, as of the date of this publication, no state is in an active EB period. The UI system has faced challenges, including a partial government shutdown in 2018-2019, which affected federal employees' eligibility for UI benefits. The President's budget for FY2020 proposes changes to the UI system, including a new required standard for state account balances within the Unemployment Trust Fund (UTF) and a new benefit entitlement for paid parental leave financed through state unemployment taxes. The UI system also faces challenges related to state solvency, with some states having insufficient funds to pay for UC benefits.

As a result, agencies without funding furloughed many federal employees, and many federal employees excepted from furlough were working without pay during the lapse in appropriations. Furloughed federal employees may be eligible for UCFE benefits. Private-sector workers who are furloughed or laid off due to the partial government shutdown because they were employed by government contractors may be eligible for regular UC benefits. But, according to guidance from the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), excepted federal employees who are performing services (without pay) would generally be ineligible for UCFE benefits based on states' definitions of \"unemployment.\" In this climate, there has been congressional interest in assisting furloughed and excepted federal employees through the UI system. UI legislative issues currently facing the 116th Congress include the following: the effects of the FY2019 sequester order on UI programs and benefits, the role of UI in providing temporary income replacement during a government shutdown, state fiscal concerns related to financing UC benefits, reemployment services and eligibility assessments (RESEA), potential consideration of the UI proposals included in the President's FY2020 budget, and congressional oversight related to a proposed UC drug testing rule reissued by DOL after previously being disapproved using the Congressional Review Act.

{"pred": " \nThe United States Postal Service (USPS) has seen significant growth in its competitive products, with revenue increasing from 10% to 28% of all USPS mail revenues between 2008 and 2017. This growth is expected to continue due to the rise of e-commerce, with USPS forecasting increased competition in the first- and last-mile delivery services. To remain competitive, USPS has implemented various measures, including leveraging automation and passive and active scan technology to capture barcode information and provide real-time visibility for customers. However, despite these efforts, instances of missed or inaccurate scans still occur, with the USPS Office of Inspector General (OIG) finding that 0.1% of delivery scans were improper in 2017. The OIG has also found that USPS employees at some facilities did not follow correct scanning procedures, leading to inconsistent counts for certain products. To address these issues, the USPS has taken steps to update its scanning devices and provide additional training to employees. However, the USPS lacks detailed and up-to-date standard operating procedures for scanning, which can make it difficult for managers to investigate and resolve scanning issues. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommends that the Postmaster General identify and adopt a set of internal control standards for operational internal control activities, improve the communication of standard operating procedures for scanning, and create standard operating procedures for managers on how to address inaccurate scans and use available reports to investigate and resolve scanning issues. The USPS has agreed to conduct a cost study to determine whether to commit resources to identifying and adopting a set of internal control standards for its operational internal control activities. The USPS has also agreed to complete corrective actions to improve scanning procedures by November 2018. The GAO report highlights the importance of accurate scanning for USPS's economic viability and the need for the USPS to continuously improve its internal controls to ensure the accurate tracking of competitive products. The report also notes that the USPS's reliance on stand-up talks and meetings to keep employees current can lead to inconsistent procedures and make it difficult for employees to access accurate scanning procedures. The GAO recommends that the USPS adopt a set of internal control standards, improve the communication of standard operating procedures, and create standard operating procedures for managers to address inaccurate scans and use available reports to investigate and resolve scanning issues.

The USPS has also agreed to complete corrective actions to improve scanning procedures by November 2018. The GAO report", "answers": ["USPS's competitive products have become increasingly important, comprising about 28 percent of USPS's total revenue. USPS scans these packages at various points throughout the postal network. When scans are inaccurate or missing, questions are raised about the veracity of USPS's data on scanning performance and can lead to customer complaints. GAO was asked to review USPS's scanning policies and procedures. In this report, GAO (1) describes USPS's scanning performance and (2) examines how USPS ensures accurate scanning. GAO reviewed USPS's policies and procedures and assessed them against internal control standards; interviewed officials from USPS and five high-volume mailers; and conducted site visits to six post offices in two USPS districts that represented a range of volume, number of routes, and performance. Mail products over which the United States Postal Service (USPS) does not exercise market dominance, such as many of its packages, are called competitive products. These items are scanned throughout the mail delivery system to track their progress (see figure). USPS data show that these products are almost always scanned. For example, USPS data showed that for the first three quarters of fiscal year 2018; all but one of USPS's 67 districts met their scanning goals. Additionally, mailers that account for a high volume of USPS's competitive products told GAO that they believed USPS was generally scanning products correctly. However, a small percentage of missed or inaccurate scans occur. For example, a report from one USPS district showed that for one week, 0.73 percent of the products delivered were missing a scan and that for the fiscal year to date almost 155,000 competitive products were missing a delivery scan. USPS has designed and implemented procedures and activities to help ensure accurate scanning, but some limitations could contribute to scanning errors. For example, USPS has not based its operational procedures for scanning on any internal control standards. USPS officials said the procedures were based on USPS's unique responsibilities, management experience, and sound business practices, but the officials could not identify specific standards or a framework that they followed as the basis for the procedures. USPS officials said they did not believe any internal controls standards applied to these procedures. By not basing procedures on standards, USPS may miss opportunities to improve how it achieves its mission to scan and measure the performance of competitive products. Additionally, USPS's scanning procedure documents, such as for outlining specific delivery scanning steps, are not always consistent, and USPS relies on more informal methods, such as meetings with employees to communicate changes. Thus, employees may not have accurate procedures available to them. Finally, USPS lacks procedures to help managers identify and address incorrect scans, address customer complaints or otherwise address scanning irregularities. For example, USPS's guidance for managers is limited to a list of bullet-points that do not detail the steps managers should follow to resolve scanning irregularities. In addition, this list has not been updated since 2005. Without consistent or detailed procedures, USPS's employees and managers may not scan items accurately or find information needed to resolve scanning issues—a situation that could hinder USPS's ability to reduce inaccurate or missing scans for these important mail products. GAO recommends that USPS: (1) identify and adopt internal control standards for its operational activities such as for scanning of competitive products; (2) improve the communication of procedures for scanning competitive products; and, (3) create procedures for supervisors on how to address inaccurate scans and resolve scanning issues. USPS agreed to explore addressing the first recommendation and agreed with the other two recommendations."], "length": 6532}

Within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) has a plan to establish 18 new national cemeteries to increase reasonable access to burial options for veterans. NCA defines reasonable access as a national or state veterans' cemetery being located within 75 miles of veterans' homes. Key parts of NCA's plan include establishing 13 urban and rural initiative national cemeteries and awarding grant funds to state applicants for establishing new state veterans' cemeteries. NCA has made limited progress in implementing its plan to increase burial access and is years behind its original schedule for opening new cemeteries. For example, NCA has opened only two of its planned urban and rural initiative sites and is behind its original schedule for the other 11 (see fig. below). The primary factor delaying NCA's completion of these cemeteries has been challenges in acquiring suitable land. NCA has also been challenged in producing accurate estimates of construction costs for most of its rural initiative sites. Cost estimates have increased more than 200 percent (from about $7 million to $24 million) for these sites, and NCA's guidance for developing cost estimates for the cemeteries does not fully incorporate the 12 steps identified in cost-estimating leading practices—such as conducting a risk and uncertainty analysis or a sensitivity analysis.

The ACV is intended to provide a more practical and cost-efficient solution to meet the Marine Corps' amphibious and land operations requirements. The ACV will be able to self-deploy from amphibious shipping and deliver a reinforced Marine infantry squad from a launch distance of at least 12 miles. The Marine Corps has also developed the Marine Personnel Carrier (MPC), which will serve as a survivable and mobile platform to transport Marines when ashore. However, the MPC program was put on hold in 2013 due to budgetary pressures, and the Marines refocused their budgetary resources to the ACV. In 2014, the Marines decided to \"resurrect\" the MPC and designate it as ACV Increment 1.1, with plans to acquire about 200 vehicles. The ACV 1.1 will have a swim capability but will rely on ship-to-shore connectors, while the ACV 1.2 will have greater amphibious capability, including greater water speed and the ability to self-deploy from amphibious ships. The Marines have selected BAE Systems to produce the ACV, with an initial contract valued at $198 million for low-rate production of 30 vehicles. The ACV program is on track to meet development cost goals, and the Marines plan to achieve Initial Operational Capability in the fourth quarter of FY 2020. The consolidation of ACV variants into a single program may result in cost savings and permit the acquisition of additional ACVs. The adoption of Expeditionary Advance Base Operations (EABO) as an operational concept may have implications for the ACV program, including potential changes to the vehicles themselves or procurement quantities.

The Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV) is intended to replace the AAV, incorporating some EFV capabilities but in a more practical and cost-efficient manner. In concert with the ACV, the Marines were developing the Marine Personnel Carrier (MPC) to serve as a survivable and mobile platform to transport Marines when ashore. The MPC was not intended to be amphibious like an AAV, EFV, or the ACV but instead would be required to have a swim capability for inland waterways such as rivers, lakes, and other water obstacles such as shore-to-shore operations in the littorals. Both vehicles were intended to play central roles in future Marine amphibious operations. On June 14, 2013, Marine leadership put the MPC program \"on ice\" due to budgetary pressures but suggested the program might be resurrected some 10 years down the road when budgetary resources might be more favorable. In what was described as a \"drastic shift,\" the Marines decided to \"resurrect\" the MPC in March 2014. The Marines designated the MPC as ACV Increment 1.1 and planned to acquire about 200 vehicles. The Marines also plan to develop ACV Increment 1.2, a tracked, fully amphibious version, and at the time planned to acquire about 470 vehicles and fund an ongoing high water speed study. Although ACV Increment 1.1 is to have a swim capability, another mode of transport (ship or aircraft) would be required to get the vehicles from ship to shore. The Marines are reportedly exploring the possibility of developing a high water speed ACV 2.0, which could accompany tanks and light armored vehicles into combat. On November 5, 2014, the Marines released a draft Request for Proposal (RFP) for ACV Increment 1.1. On November 24, 2015, the Marine Corps awarded BAE Systems and SAIC contracts to develop ACV 1.1 prototypes for evaluation. BAE's contract was for $103.8 million and SAIC's for $121.5 million, and each company was to build 16 prototypes to be tested over the next two years. Both BAE and SAIC delivered their prototypes early, and Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) testing began mid-March 2017. In early December 2017, the Marines reportedly sent the ACV 1.1 down select request for proposals to BAE and Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC). On June 19, 2018, the Marine Corps selected BAE Systems to produce the ACV. The initial contract—valued at $198 million—was for low-rate production of 30 vehicles to be delivered by the autumn of 2019. On April 10, 2019, during testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee, Navy and Marine Corps leadership announced that during the fall of 2018, ACV 1.1 prototypes demonstrated satisfactory water mobility performance in high surf conditions and, in doing so, met the full water mobility transition requirement for ACV 1.2 capability. As a result, ACV 1.1 and ACV 1.2 were to be consolidated into a single variant—the ACV—which is intended to replace all AAVs.

The minority leader occupies a number of important institutional and party roles and responsibilities, and his or her fundamental goal is to recapture majority control of the House. From a party perspective, the minority leader has a wide range of assignments, all geared toward retaking majority control of the House. Five principal party activities direct the work of the minority leader. First, he or she provides campaign assistance to party incumbents and challengers. Second, the minority leader devises strategies, in consultation with like-minded colleagues, to advance party objectives. Third, the minority leader works to promote and publicize the party's agenda. Fourth, the minority leader, if his or her party controls the White House, confers regularly with the President and his aides about issues before Congress, the Administration's agenda, and political events generally. Fifth, the minority leader strives to promote party harmony so as to maximize the chances for legislative and political success. From an institutional perspective, the rules of the House assign a number of specific responsibilities to the minority leader. For example, Rule XIII, clause 6, grants the minority leader (or a designee) the right to offer a motion to recommit with instructions; and Rule II, clause 6, states that the Inspector General shall be appointed by joint recommendation of the Speaker, majority leader, and minority leader. The minority leader also has other institutional duties, such as appointing individuals to certain federal or congressional entities."], "length": 5815}

As of March 31, 2018, 13% of State's overseas Foreign Service positions were vacant, with specialist positions remaining vacant at a higher rate. Vacancies in Foreign Service positions at overseas posts increase workloads and adversely affect the morale of Foreign Service employees. State's efforts to address Foreign Service vacancies are not guided by an integrated action plan to reduce persistent vacancies. The Secretary of State should develop an integrated action plan that defines the root causes of persistent Foreign Service vacancies at overseas posts and provides suggested corrective measures to reduce such vacancies. State's Foreign Service generalists and specialists at overseas posts are critical to advancing U.S. foreign policy and economic interests abroad, but persistent vacancies in critical positions at overseas posts have adversely affected State's ability to carry out its mission effectively and threaten State's ability to ensure the security and safety of its employees, their families, and post facilities. The GAO found that State lacks an integrated action plan to guide its efforts to address persistent Foreign Service vacancies, and without defining the root causes of persistent Foreign Service vacancies at overseas posts and identifying appropriate corrective measures, overseas vacancies may persist and continue to adversely affect State's ability to achieve U.S. foreign policy goals. The GAO recommends that the Secretary of State develop an integrated action plan to address persistent Foreign Service vacancies.

This report examines (1) vacancies in State's Foreign Service staffing at overseas posts, (2) reported effects of Foreign Service vacancies on diplomatic readiness, and (3) State's efforts to address Foreign Service vacancies. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed State's Global Employment Management System data as of March 2018. The system includes information on Foreign Service and Civil Service positions, including the total number of authorized Foreign Service positions and whether each position is filled or vacant. GAO also reviewed its relevant prior reports and State workforce planning documents. In addition, GAO interviewed State staff at 10 overseas posts, selected on the basis of large numbers of Foreign Service vacancies and diversity in the types of Foreign Service positions that were vacant at these posts, among other factors. The Department of State's (State) data show persistent Foreign Service vacancies at overseas posts since 2008. According to the data, 13 percent of overseas Foreign Service positions were vacant as of March 2018. This percentage is similar to the percentages GAO reported for 2008 and 2012, when 14 percent of these positions were vacant. In addition, State's data show persistent vacancies at overseas posts in generalist positions that help formulate and implement U.S. foreign policy and in specialist positions that support and maintain the functioning of overseas posts. State's data also show persistent Foreign Service vacancies at overseas posts with State's highest foreign policy priorities and in regions with security risks that could threaten U.S. foreign policy interests. According to staff at overseas posts, Foreign Service vacancies adversely affect State's ability to carry out U.S. foreign policy. Staff at overseas posts told us that vacancies increase workloads, contributing to low morale and higher stress for Foreign Service staff and that vacancies in Political and Economic positions—20 percent and 16 percent, respectively—limit the reporting on political and economic issues that posts are able to provide to State headquarters. Notably, officials also stated that vacancies in specialist positions may heighten security risks at overseas posts and disrupt post operations. For instance, some overseas post staff said that vacancies in Information Management positions had increased the vulnerability of posts' computer networks to potential cybersecurity attacks and other malicious threats. State described various efforts—implemented by multiple offices in the department —to help address overseas Foreign Service vacancies, but these efforts are not guided by an integrated action plan to reduce persistent vacancies. An example of State's efforts is the “Hard-to-Fill” program, which allows Civil Service staff an opportunity to fill a Foreign Service vacancy on a single overseas tour. According to GAO's 2017 High-Risk Series report, an agency should design and implement an action plan—integrated across its relevant offices—that defines the root causes of all skills gaps and suggests corrective measures. However, State has not developed such an action plan for reducing persistent overseas Foreign Service vacancies.

The U.S. government provides funding to these organizations through assistance agreements, which are subject to monitoring and oversight to ensure that federal funds are used effectively and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. However, a review of 12 selected assistance agreements found that two agencies, the Department of State and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, did not consistently include all key monitoring provisions in their agreements, and three agencies, the Department of State, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, did not have full documentation of monitoring activities for the agreements reviewed. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommends that the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) ensure that USAID officials have full documentation of required monitoring activities in agreements with inter-American organizations, and that the U.S. Department of Agriculture ensure that USDA includes all key monitoring provisions specified by applicable guidance as part of agreements with inter-American organizations and that USDA officials have full documentation of required monitoring activities in agreements with inter-American organizations. The GAO also recommends that the U.S. Department of State take corrective action to ensure that it includes all key monitoring provisions in its agreements with inter-American organizations.

GAO analyzed documents and interviewed officials from State, USAID, HHS, USDA, and the organizations. GAO also analyzed a nongeneralizable sample of 12 of the 60 assistance agreements that were awarded by State, USAID, HHS, and USDA to OAS, PAHO, and IICA and were active during calendar years 2014 through 2016. For each agency, GAO selected three agreements with the lowest, median, and highest dollar value. GAO found that strategic goals of the Organization of American States (OAS), the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA), and the Pan-American Institute of Geography and History (PAIGH) are predominantly aligned with the strategic goals of the Department of State (State), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). For example, IICA's strategic goals of a productive agricultural sector, enhancing agricultural development, and food security are aligned with USDA's foreign assistance goals. State, USAID, HHS, and USDA fund activities in the form of assistance agreements (e.g., grants and cooperative agreements) with OAS, PAHO, and IICA, which in 2016 totaled $32 million. According to agency officials, the agencies employ mechanisms to ensure that these agreements align with U.S. strategic goals. OAS, PAHO, IICA, and PAIGH have established mechanisms for overseeing their use of funds, such as external auditors, internal audit boards, and anti-fraud and ethics policies. State and USDA have directly supported these mechanisms. For example, State engaged in the selection process for OAS's Inspector General. GAO's review of 12 selected assistance agreements found that USDA included no financial or performance monitoring provisions in one of its agreements and that State did not include two key monitoring provisions in one of its agreements, called for by applicable guidance. GAO found that the remaining 10 agreements it reviewed contained all key monitoring provisions and that State has since taken corrective action. GAO found that U.S. agencies did not have full documentation of 18 of the 42 monitoring activities required by the 12 assistance agreements GAO reviewed (see table). For example, USDA did not have full documentation, such as for financial reports, of any of its 10 required monitoring activities and USDA officials did not explain their lack of documentation. USAID officials explained that their lack of full documentation was due, in part, to grant officers not always following their document management policies. State and HHS have since taken corrective action. If an agency does not have full documentation of monitoring activities, it may lack information needed to make appropriate budgetary and programmatic decisions.

The review found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the medical centers required reviews of 148 providers' clinical care after concerns were raised, but officials could not provide documentation to show that almost half of these reviews were conducted. The review also found that the medical centers lacked documentation showing that reviews had been conducted for 26 providers, and that 21 providers were never conducted. The review attributed the shortcomings to VHA policy not requiring documentation of all types of reviews and inadequate oversight by VHA. The review recommended that VHA require documentation of all reviews, establish a timeliness requirement for initiating reviews, and strengthen its oversight. VA concurred with the recommendations and described plans to revise existing policy and update the standardized audit tool. The review also found that the medical centers failed to report providers to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) and state licensing boards as required, which facilitated providers who provided substandard care at one facility obtaining privileges at another VA medical center or at hospitals outside of VA's health care system. The review recommended that VHA require its networks to establish a process for overseeing VA medical centers to ensure they are reporting to the NPDB and to state licensing boards and to ensure that this reporting is timely. VA concurred with this recommendation. The review concluded that VHA lacks reasonable assurance that all providers who should be reported to these entities are reported.

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (VAMC) officials are responsible for reviewing the clinical care delivered by their privileged providers—physicians and dentists who are approved to independently perform specific services—after concerns are raised. The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care. For example, GAO found that after one VAMC failed to report to the NPDB or SLBs a provider who resigned to avoid an adverse privileging action, a non-VA hospital in the same city took an adverse privileging action against that same provider for the same reason 2 years later."], "length": 7083}

GAO was asked to review U.S. assistance to these four organizations. In this report, GAO (1) assesses the extent to which the organizations' strategic goals align with those of U.S. agencies; (2) examines how the organizations oversee the use of their funds and the extent to which U.S. agencies have supported those efforts; (3) assesses the extent to which U.S. agencies included key monitoring provisions as part of assistance agreements; and (4) assesses the extent to which U.S. agencies had documentation of monitoring activities, including those called for by these provisions. GAO analyzed documents and interviewed officials from State, USAID, HHS, USDA, and the organizations. GAO also analyzed a nongeneralizable sample of 12 of the 60 assistance agreements that were awarded by State, USAID, HHS, and USDA to OAS, PAHO, and IICA and were active during calendar years 2014 through 2016. For each agency, GAO selected three agreements with the lowest, median, and highest dollar value. GAO found that strategic goals of the Organization of American States (OAS), the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA), and the Pan-American Institute of Geography and History (PAIGH) are predominantly aligned with the strategic goals of the Department of State (State), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). For example, IICA's strategic goals of a productive agricultural sector, enhancing agricultural development, and food security are aligned with USDA's foreign assistance goals. State, USAID, HHS, and USDA fund activities in the form of assistance agreements (e.g., grants and cooperative agreements) with OAS, PAHO, and IICA, which in 2016 totaled $32 million. According to agency officials, the agencies employ mechanisms to ensure that these agreements align with U.S. strategic goals. OAS, PAHO, IICA, and PAIGH have established mechanisms for overseeing their use of funds, such as external auditors, internal audit boards, and anti-fraud and ethics policies. State and USDA have directly supported these mechanisms. For example, State engaged in the selection process for OAS's Inspector General. GAO's review of 12 selected assistance agreements found that USDA included no financial or performance monitoring provisions in one of its agreements and that State did not include two key monitoring provisions in one of its agreements, called for by applicable guidance. GAO found that the remaining 10 agreements it reviewed contained all key monitoring provisions and that State has since taken corrective action. GAO found that U.S. agencies did not have full documentation of 18 of the 42 monitoring activities required by the 12 assistance agreements GAO reviewed (see table). For example, USDA did not have full documentation, such as for financial reports, of any of its 10 required monitoring activities and USDA officials did not explain their lack of documentation. USAID officials explained that their lack of full documentation was due, in part, to grant officers not always following their document management policies. State and HHS have since taken corrective action. If an agency does not have full documentation of monitoring activities, it may lack information needed to make appropriate budgetary and programmatic decisions. GAO recommends that (1) USDA ensure inclusion of all monitoring provisions as part of agreements and (2) USAID and USDA ensure full documentation of monitoring activities. USDA and USAID concurred with GAO's recommendations."], "length": 6450}
{"pred": " \nThe U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) has been implementing the European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) to enhance its posture in Europe, particularly in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea. However, DOD's planning process for ERI has been separate from its established posture-planning processes, which has led to a lack of prioritization of ERI initiatives relative to those funded in the base budget. This has resulted in a lack of understanding of the relative importance of ERI initiatives and the potential for long-term fiscal risk if DOD shifts more ERI-associated enduring costs into its Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) budget. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommends that DOD prioritize ERI initiatives relative to those funded in the base budget, develop estimates for future sustainment costs, and provide Congress with estimates of the future costs for posture initiatives funded under ERI. DOD has partially concurred with these recommendations, but the GAO remains concerned that DOD's current planning process may lead to long-term fiscal risk and a lack of congressional visibility into ERI's future costs. The GAO also notes that DOD has requested funding for ERI enhancements using its OCO budget, which was not designed to plan for and fund long-term, enduring initiatives. The GAO recommends that DOD use its established posture-planning processes to prioritize ERI initiatives, develop estimates for future sustainment costs, and provide Congress with estimates of the future costs for posture initiatives funded under ERI. The GAO also notes that DOD has identified approximately $224 million in unspecified minor military construction and facilities maintenance and repair projects that were programmed or obligated for ERI in fiscal years 2015 through 2017. The GAO recommends that DOD provide Congress with estimates of the future costs for posture initiatives funded under ERI and information on any underlying assumptions, such as those pertaining to the level of host nation support and burden sharing. The GAO also notes that DOD has not provided Congress with projections of future costs for posture initiatives funded under ERI because it is reviewing those requirements outside of its budget and programming processes. The GAO recommends that DOD increase congressional visibility into ERI's future costs and its underlying assumptions to facilitate congressional oversight and reasonably ensure that initiatives can be sustained over the long-term. The GAO also notes that DOD has requested funding for ERI enhancements using its OCO budget, which was not designed to plan for and fund long-term, enduring initiatives.

This initiative has been funded using OCO appropriations, which Congress provides in addition to DOD's base budget appropriations. The Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying the Continuing Appropriations and Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017, included a provision for GAO to review matters related to ERI. In this report, we (1) describe changes in ERI's objectives, funding under ERI, and DOD's posture in Europe since 2014 and (2) evaluate the extent to which DOD's planning processes for posture initiatives funded under ERI prioritize those initiatives, estimate their long-term costs, and communicate their estimated costs to Congress. GAO analyzed DOD strategy documentation, budget and cost analysis guidance, budget justification materials, and cost and obligations data. GAO also interviewed knowledgeable officials within the Office of the Secretary of Defense, U.S. European Command, the military services, and the State Department. Since 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) has expanded the European Reassurance Initiative's (ERI) objectives, increased its funding, and planned enhancements to European posture. DOD expanded ERI's objectives from the short-term reassurance of allies and partners to include deterring Russian aggression in the long term and developing the capacity to field a credible combined force should deterrence fail. With respect to funding, DOD will have requested approximately $4.5 billion for ERI's posture enhancements through the end of fiscal year 2017 (about $3.2 billion for fiscal year 2017 alone), and in July 2016 EUCOM identified funding needs for future posture initiatives. The expansion of ERI's objectives has contributed to DOD's enhancing its posture in Europe. Specifically, DOD has increased the size and duration of Army combat unit deployments, planned to preposition Army equipment in Eastern Europe, added new enduring locations (e.g., locations that DOD expects to access and use to support U.S. security interests for the foreseeable future), improved infrastructure, and negotiated new agreements with European nations. As of April 2017, DOD was considering further force enhancements under ERI as part of the department's ERI budget request. DOD also was reviewing whether new enduring locations to support ERI were needed and was considering other improvements to existing infrastructure. DOD's process for planning ERI has not established priorities among posture initiatives funded under ERI relative to those in its base budget, nor estimated long-term sustainment costs for some posture initiatives funded under ERI, nor communicated future costs to Congress. ERI is being planned using a separate process from DOD's established processes and is funded from DOD's overseas contingency operations (OCO) appropriations. GAO found several weaknesses: Lack of prioritization : DOD establishes priorities among ERI posture initiatives but has not evaluated them against base budget initiatives using its posture management process. As a result, DOD lacks an understanding of the relative importance of ERI initiatives and may be investing in projects that it will not continue should OCO funding become unavailable. Lack of sustainment costs : EUCOM and the military services have not fully estimated the long-term costs to sustain equipment and construction funded under ERI. Based on DOD's approach for calculating rough order sustainment costs, GAO determined that these costs could be substantial. DOD officials said that GAO correctly applied DOD's approach for estimating sustainment costs, but noted that actual costs may be lower, because the military services may not fully fund sustainment. In the absence of comprehensive estimates, DOD has been limited in its ability to assess affordability and plan for future costs. Not communicating future costs : DOD limits Congress's visibility into the resources needed to implement ERI and achieve its objectives because it does not include future costs in its ERI budget request. This is a public version of a classified report issued in August 2017. Information on specific posture planning, guidance, and budget estimates that DOD deemed to be classified have been omitted from this report. GAO recommends that DOD prioritize ERI posture initiatives against initiatives in its base budget, develop cost estimates for sustaining initiatives, and communicate future costs to Congress.

The IA program provides financial and direct assistance to disaster victims for expenses and needs that cannot be met through other means, such as insurance. FEMA evaluates IA declaration requests using six regulatory factors, including concentration of damages, trauma, special populations, voluntary agency assistance, insurance coverage, and average amount of individual assistance by state. However, our analysis of RVARs from July 2012 through December 2016 found that regions did not consistently obtain and document information on all elements of the IA regulatory factors.

When a state, U.S. territory, or tribe requests IA assistance through a federal disaster declaration, FEMA evaluates the request against regulatory factors, such as concentration of damages, and provides a recommendation to the President, who makes a final declaration decision. GAO was asked to review FEMA's IA declaration process. This report examines (1) the number of IA declaration requests received, declared, and denied, and IA actual obligations from calendar years 2008 through 2016, (2) the extent to which FEMA accounts for the regulatory factors when evaluating IA requests, and (3) any challenges FEMA regions and select states reported on the declaration process and factors and any FEMA actions to revise them. GAO reviewed FEMA's policies, IA declaration requests and obligation data, and FEMA's RVARs from July 2012 through December 2016, the most recent years for which data were available. GAO also reviewed proposed rulemaking comments and interviewed FEMA officials from all 10 regions and 11 state emergency management offices selected based on declaration requests and other factors. From calendar years 2008 through 2016, the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Federal Emergency and Management Agency (FEMA) received 294 Individual Assistance (IA) declaration requests from states, U.S. territories, and tribes to help individuals meet their immediate needs after a disaster. Of these, the President declared 168 and denied 126 requests. Across the various types of IA declaration requests, severe storms (190) were the most common disaster type and drought (1) was among the least common. FEMA obligated about $8.6 billion in IA for disaster declarations during this period. GAO found that FEMA regions did not consistently obtain and document information on all elements of established IA regulatory factors when making IA recommendations to headquarters. Following a declaration request, a FEMA region is to prepare a Regional Administrator's Validation and Recommendation (RVAR)—a document designed to include data on each of the six IA regulatory factors for each declaration request as well as the regional administrator's recommendation. GAO reviewed all 81 RVARs from July 2012—the date FEMA began using the new RVAR template—through December 2016. GAO found that regions did not consistently obtain and document information for the elements required under the six regulatory factors (see table). For example, only 44 of the 81 RVARs documented all elements under the concentration of damage factor. By evaluating why regions are not completing all elements of each current IA regulatory factor, FEMA could identify whether any corrective steps are needed. Officials from the 10 FEMA regions and 11 states GAO interviewed, reported positive relationships with each other, but also cited various challenges with the IA declaration process and regulatory factors. For example, these officials told GAO that there are no established minimum thresholds for IA, making final determinations more subjective and the rationale behind denials unclear. However, as required by the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013, FEMA has taken steps to revise the IA factors by issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking. According to FEMA, the proposed rule aims to provide more objective criteria, clarify the threshold for eligibility, and speed up the IA declaration process. As of April 2018, the proposed rule was still under consideration. According to FEMA officials, they plan to finalize the rule in late 2018; therefore, it is too early to know the extent to which it will address these challenges.

The U.S. support was initially limited to providing precision-guided munitions and intelligence sharing, but it expanded over time to include in-flight refueling and military advice. However, the U.S. involvement in the conflict has been criticized by many lawmakers, who have expressed concerns about the humanitarian situation in Yemen, civilian casualties, and the role of Iran in the conflict. In 2016, the Obama Administration initiated a review of U.S. security assistance to Saudi Arabia, and in 2017, the Trump Administration notified Congress that it would proceed with proposed sales of precision-guided munitions to Saudi Arabia. The U.S. support for the coalition has been the subject of intense debate in Congress, with some lawmakers arguing that it is necessary to counter Iranian influence and others arguing that it is exacerbating the humanitarian crisis. In 2018, the Senate passed a resolution directing the President to remove U.S. forces from hostilities in Yemen, and the House passed a resolution expressing opposition to the U.S. involvement in the conflict. The U.S. involvement in the Yemen conflict remains a contentious issue, with many lawmakers expressing concerns about the humanitarian situation and the role of the U.S. in the conflict. The conflict has also been marked by a significant humanitarian crisis, with millions of people in need of food, water, and medical aid. The U.S. has provided significant humanitarian aid to Yemen, but the conflict has also led to a significant increase in civilian casualties and a worsening of the humanitarian situation. The conflict has also been marked by a significant increase in the use of drones and other military technology, which has raised concerns about the potential for further escalation and the impact on civilians. The U.S. involvement in the conflict has also been criticized by many human rights groups, who have expressed concerns about the use of cluster munitions and other weapons that have caused significant harm to civilians. The conflict has also been marked by a significant increase in the use of propaganda and disinformation, which has made it difficult to determine the facts on the ground.

The 116th Congress may continue to debate U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition and Saudi Arabia's conduct of the war in Yemen, where fighting has continued since March 2015. The war has exacerbated a humanitarian crisis in Yemen that began in 2011; presently, the World Food Program reports that 20 million Yemenis face hunger in the absence of sustained food assistance. The difficulty of accessing certain areas of Yemen has made it hard for governments and aid agencies to count the war's casualties. Data collected by the U.S. and European-funded Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) suggest that 60,000 Yemenis have been killed since January 2016. The Trump Administration has opposed various congressional proposals, including initiatives to reject or condition proposed U.S. arms sales or to require an end to U.S. military support to Saudi-led coalition operations in Yemen.

It highlights the various statutory and constitutional authorities available to the President in times of crisis or exigency. The passage notes that the exercise of emergency powers has been somewhat dependent on the Chief Executive's view of the presidential office, with some Presidents, such as Theodore Roosevelt, advocating for a more expansive view of executive power. The passage also discusses the National Emergencies Act of 1976, which established a procedure for the presidential declaration and congressional regulation of a national emergency. The act required the President to indicate the powers and authorities being activated in response to an emergency and established a process for congressional termination of a declared national emergency. The passage concludes that the National Emergencies Act has not been revisited by congressional overseers since its enactment and that further improvements and reforms in this policy area might be pursued. The passage also notes an anomaly in the activation of emergency powers in 2005, when President George W. Bush issued a proclamation suspending certain wage requirements without declaring a national emergency. The passage highlights the importance of understanding the development and exercise of emergency powers in the United States. Key evidence presented includes the National Emergencies Act of 1976, the various statutory and constitutional authorities available to the President, and the historical development of emergency powers in the United States.

Such powers may be stated explicitly or implied by the Constitution, assumed by the Chief Executive to be permissible constitutionally, or inferred from or specified by statute. Through legislation, Congress has made a great many delegations of authority in this regard over the past 230 years. There are, however, limits and restraints upon the President in his exercise of emergency powers. With the exception of the habeas corpus clause, the Constitution makes no allowance for the suspension of any of its provisions during a national emergency. Disputes over the constitutionality or legality of the exercise of emergency powers are judicially reviewable. Both the judiciary and Congress, as co-equal branches, can restrain the executive regarding emergency powers. So can public opinion. Since 1976, the President has been subject to certain procedural formalities in utilizing some statutorily delegated emergency authority. The National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. §§1601-1651) eliminated or modified some statutory grants of emergency authority, required the President to formally declare the existence of a national emergency and to specify what statutory authority activated by the declaration would be used, and provided Congress a means to countermand the President's declaration and the activated authority being sought.

The RRB paid nearly $12.5 billion in retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to approximately 548,000 beneficiaries in FY2017. The RRB also paid almost $105.4 million in unemployment and sickness benefits to approximately 28,000 claimants.

Tier II annuities are paid in addition to Tier I annuities and are based solely on covered railroad service. The RRB's programs also provide disability annuities, spousal annuities, and survivor annuities to eligible beneficiaries. The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act (RUIA) provides for employers to pay a surcharge if the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Account falls below an indexed threshold amount.

Of the total $12.5 billion benefit payments in the same fiscal year, 60.0% was paid to retired workers, 8.0% to disabled workers, 14.4% to spouses, and 16.8% to survivors. The Railroad Retirement Act (RRA) authorizes retirement, disability, and survivor benefits for railroad workers and their families. RRA is financed primarily by payroll taxes, financial interchanges from Social Security, and transfers from the National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust (NRRIT). Railroad retirement payroll taxes have two tiers: the Tier I tax is essentially the same as the Social Security payroll tax and the Tier II tax is set each year based on the railroad retirement system's asset balances, benefit payments, and administrative costs. In FY2017, the gross RRA funding was about $12.7 billion. Railroad retirement annuities are also divided into two tiers. Tier I annuities are designed to be nearly equivalent to Social Security benefits and are based on both railroad retirement and Social Security-covered employment. However, Tier I annuities are more generous than Social Security benefits in certain situations. For example, at the age of 60, railroad workers with at least 30 years of covered railroad work may receive unreduced retirement annuities. Tier II annuities are similar to private pensions and based solely on covered railroad service. Tier II annuities are paid in addition to Tier I annuities.

The method involves obtaining a 3D image dataset of the examination region, generating a 3D vascular model, capturing a contrast agent propagation in the examination region, inputting blood flow parameters, and starting a CFD simulation of the blood flow in the 3D vascular model. The method also involves generating virtual 2D angiography recordings from the results of the CFD simulation, determining a degree of correspondence between the real and virtual 2D angiography recordings, and comparing the degree of correspondence with predefinable tolerance values. The method enables the CFD simulation results to be validated for the individual patient, or any deviations to be quantitatively determined and used iteratively to improve the CFD simulation. The degree of correspondence is a two-dimensional field that can be represented as an image and permits an evaluation of the correspondence between the virtual and the real angiography. The method is particularly useful for validating CFD simulations for individual patients, as it allows for the comparison of virtual and real angiography recordings from identical angulation and adjusted recording geometry.

The ACV is intended to provide a more practical and cost-efficient solution to meet the Marine Corps' amphibious and land operations requirements. The ACV will be able to self-deploy from amphibious shipping and deliver a reinforced Marine infantry squad from a launch distance of at least 12 miles. The Marine Corps has also developed the Marine Personnel Carrier (MPC), which will serve as a survivable and mobile platform to transport Marines when ashore. However, the MPC program was put on hold in 2013 due to budgetary pressures, and the Marines refocused their budgetary resources to the ACV. In 2014, the Marines decided to \"resurrect\" the MPC and designate it as ACV Increment 1.1, with plans to acquire about 200 vehicles. The ACV 1.1 will have a swim capability but will rely on ship-to-shore connectors, while the ACV 1.2 will have greater amphibious capability, including greater water speed and the ability to self-deploy from amphibious ships. The Marines have selected BAE Systems to produce the ACV, with an initial contract valued at $198 million for low-rate production of 30 vehicles. The ACV program is on track to meet development cost goals, and the Marines plan to achieve Initial Operational Capability in the fourth quarter of FY 2020. The consolidation of ACV variants into a single program may result in cost savings and permit the acquisition of additional ACVs. The adoption of Expeditionary Advance Base Operations (EABO) as an operational concept may have implications for the ACV program, including potential changes to the vehicles themselves or procurement quantities.

The Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV) is intended to replace the AAV, incorporating some EFV capabilities but in a more practical and cost-efficient manner. In concert with the ACV, the Marines were developing the Marine Personnel Carrier (MPC) to serve as a survivable and mobile platform to transport Marines when ashore. The MPC was not intended to be amphibious like an AAV, EFV, or the ACV but instead would be required to have a swim capability for inland waterways such as rivers, lakes, and other water obstacles such as shore-to-shore operations in the littorals. Both vehicles were intended to play central roles in future Marine amphibious operations. On June 14, 2013, Marine leadership put the MPC program \"on ice\" due to budgetary pressures but suggested the program might be resurrected some 10 years down the road when budgetary resources might be more favorable. In what was described as a \"drastic shift,\" the Marines decided to \"resurrect\" the MPC in March 2014. The Marines designated the MPC as ACV Increment 1.1 and planned to acquire about 200 vehicles. The Marines also plan to develop ACV Increment 1.2, a tracked, fully amphibious version, and at the time planned to acquire about 470 vehicles and fund an ongoing high water speed study. Although ACV Increment 1.1 is to have a swim capability, another mode of transport (ship or aircraft) would be required to get the vehicles from ship to shore. The Marines are reportedly exploring the possibility of developing a high water speed ACV 2.0, which could accompany tanks and light armored vehicles into combat. On November 5, 2014, the Marines released a draft Request for Proposal (RFP) for ACV Increment 1.1. On November 24, 2015, the Marine Corps awarded BAE Systems and SAIC contracts to develop ACV 1.1 prototypes for evaluation. BAE's contract was for $103.8 million and SAIC's for $121.5 million, and each company was to build 16 prototypes to be tested over the next two years. Both BAE and SAIC delivered their prototypes early, and Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) testing began mid-March 2017. In early December 2017, the Marines reportedly sent the ACV 1.1 down select request for proposals to BAE and Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC). On June 19, 2018, the Marine Corps selected BAE Systems to produce the ACV.

The use of cluster munitions has been widespread, with over 21 countries using them in various conflicts. However, their use has been criticized due to their indiscriminate nature and high failure rates, which can result in unexploded submunitions remaining on the battlefield for decades. The Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM) was signed by 94 countries in 2008, banning the use, production, and transfer of cluster munitions. However, the United States has not signed the convention, citing concerns over its impact on military operations and national security. The US has instead implemented its own policy on cluster munitions, which requires that new munitions meet a 1% or less unexploded submunitions standard. The policy also allows for the use of cluster munitions in extreme situations, and the US has continued to develop and procure new cluster munitions despite the CCM. The use of cluster munitions has been a contentious issue, with some arguing that they are a necessary tool for military operations, while others see them as a humanitarian concern. The US has also been criticized for its continued use of cluster munitions, despite the CCM and its own policy. The development of \"smart\" or sensor-fuzed cluster munitions has been seen as a way to reduce the risks associated with cluster munitions, but their effectiveness and reliability are still uncertain.

Cluster munitions were developed in World War II and are part of many nations' weapons stockpiles. Cluster munitions have been used frequently in combat, including the early phases of the current conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Cluster munitions have been highly criticized internationally for causing a significant number of civilian deaths, and efforts have been undertaken to ban and regulate their use. The Department of Defense (DOD) continues to view cluster munitions as a military necessity but in 2008 instituted a policy to reduce the failure rate of cluster munitions to 1% or less after 2018. In November 2017, a new DOD policy was issued that essentially reversed the 2008 policy. Under the new policy, combatant commanders can use cluster munitions that do not meet the 1% or less unexploded submunitions standard in extreme situations to meet immediate warfighting demands. In addition, the new policy does not establish a deadline to replace cluster munitions exceeding the 1% rate and states that DOD \"will retain cluster munitions currently in active inventories until the capabilities they provide are replaced with enhanced and more reliable munitions.\" Potential issues for Congress include cluster munitions in an era of precision weapons, other weapons in lieu of cluster munitions, and the potential impact of DOD's 2017 revised cluster munitions policy."], "length": 6972}

The GAO identified progress and challenges in several areas, including facility risk assessment, compliance inspections, and stakeholder outreach. DHS made changes to the program, including improving data sharing and risk assessment methods. The GAO found that DHS had addressed several of its recommendations, including developing a new Top-Screen to collect accurate data and implementing a peer review process for risk assessment. However, the GAO noted that DHS still had work to do, including completing compliance inspections and improving its risk assessment approach. The GAO is currently reviewing DHS's efforts to assess risk and prioritize facilities. Overall, the GAO's evaluation suggests that DHS has made progress in improving the CFATS program, but there is still room for improvement. Key evidence presented includes data on the number of facilities that had reported having ammonium nitrate and the results of DHS's efforts to identify potentially non-compliant facilities. The GAO's recommendations and DHS's responses provide insight into the challenges and opportunities for improvement in the CFATS program. The GAO's evaluation highlights the importance of accurate data and effective risk assessment in ensuring the security of chemical facilities. The use of a peer review process and the development of a new Top-Screen are innovative points made in the passage, demonstrating DHS's efforts to improve the program.

In accordance with the DHS Appropriations Act, 2007, DHS established the CFATS program in 2007 to, among other things, identify and assess the security risk posed by chemical facilities. DHS inspects high-risk facilities after it approves facility security plans to ensure that the facilities are implementing required security measures and procedures. This statement summarizes progress and challenges related to DHS's CFATS program management. This statement is based on prior products GAO issued from July 2012 through June 2017, along with updates conducted in June 2018 on DHS actions to address prior GAO recommendations. To conduct the prior work, GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and DHS policies for administering the CFATS program, how DHS assesses risk, and data on high-risk chemical facilities. GAO also interviewed DHS officials and reviewed information on DHS actions to implement its prior recommendations. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has made progress addressing challenges that GAO's past work identified to managing the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) program. The following summarizes progress made and challenges remaining in key aspects of the program. Identifying high-risk chemical facilities. In July 2015, GAO reported that DHS used self-reported and unverified data to determine the risk of facilities holding toxic chemicals that could threaten surrounding communities if released. GAO recommended that DHS should better verify the accuracy of facility-reported data. DHS implemented this recommendation by revising its methodology so it now calculates the risk of toxic release, rather than relying on facilities to do so. Assessing risk and prioritizing facilities. In April 2013, GAO reported weaknesses in multiple aspects of DHS's risk assessment and prioritization approach. GAO made two recommendations for DHS to review and improve this process, including that DHS enhance its risk assessment approach to incorporate all of the elements of consequence, threat, and vulnerability associated with a terrorist attack involving certain chemicals. DHS launched a new risk assessment methodology in October 2016 and is currently gathering new or updated data from about 27,000 facilities to (1) determine which facilities should be categorized as high-risk because of the threat of sabotage, theft or diversion, or a toxic release and (2) assign those facilities deemed high risk to one of four risk-based tiers. GAO has ongoing work assessing these efforts and will report later this summer on the extent to which they fully address prior recommendations. Reviewing and approving facilities' site security plans . DHS is to review security plans and visit facilities to ensure their security measures meet DHS standards. In April 2013, GAO reported a 7 to 9 year backlog for these reviews and visits. In July 2015, GAO reported that DHS had made substantial progress in addressing the backlog—estimating that it could take between 9 and 12 months for DHS to review and approve security plans for the approximately 900 remaining facilities. DHS has since taken additional action to expedite these activities and has eliminated this backlog. Inspecting facilities and ensuring compliance. In July 2015, GAO reported that DHS conducted compliance inspections at 83 of the 1,727 facilities with approved security plans. GAO found that nearly half of the inspected facilities were not fully compliant with their approved security plans and that DHS did not have documented procedures for managing facilities' compliance. GAO recommended that DHS document procedures for managing compliance. As a result, DHS has developed an enforcement procedure and a draft compliance inspection procedure and expects to finalize the compliance inspection procedure by the end of fiscal year 2018. GAO has made various recommendations to strengthen DHS's management of the CFATS program, with which DHS has generally agreed. DHS has implemented or described planned actions to address most of these recommendations."], "length": 5548}

The IA program provides financial and direct assistance to disaster victims for expenses and needs that cannot be met through other means, such as insurance. FEMA evaluates IA declaration requests using six regulatory factors, including concentration of damages, trauma, special populations, voluntary agency assistance, insurance coverage, and average amount of individual assistance by state. However, our analysis of RVARs from July 2012 through December 2016 found that regions did not consistently obtain and document information on all elements of the IA regulatory factors.

When a state, U.S. territory, or tribe requests IA assistance through a federal disaster declaration, FEMA evaluates the request against regulatory factors, such as concentration of damages, and provides a recommendation to the President, who makes a final declaration decision. GAO was asked to review FEMA's IA declaration process. This report examines (1) the number of IA declaration requests received, declared, and denied, and IA actual obligations from calendar years 2008 through 2016, (2) the extent to which FEMA accounts for the regulatory factors when evaluating IA requests, and (3) any challenges FEMA regions and select states reported on the declaration process and factors and any FEMA actions to revise them. GAO reviewed FEMA's policies, IA declaration requests and obligation data, and FEMA's RVARs from July 2012 through December 2016, the most recent years for which data were available. GAO also reviewed proposed rulemaking comments and interviewed FEMA officials from all 10 regions and 11 state emergency management offices selected based on declaration requests and other factors. From calendar years 2008 through 2016, the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Federal Emergency and Management Agency (FEMA) received 294 Individual Assistance (IA) declaration requests from states, U.S. territories, and tribes to help individuals meet their immediate needs after a disaster. Of these, the President declared 168 and denied 126 requests. Across the various types of IA declaration requests, severe storms (190) were the most common disaster type and drought (1) was among the least common. FEMA obligated about $8.6 billion in IA for disaster declarations during this period. GAO found that FEMA regions did not consistently obtain and document information on all elements of established IA regulatory factors when making IA recommendations to headquarters. Following a declaration request, a FEMA region is to prepare a Regional Administrator's Validation and Recommendation (RVAR)—a document designed to include data on each of the six IA regulatory factors for each declaration request as well as the regional administrator's recommendation. GAO reviewed all 81 RVARs from July 2012—the date FEMA began using the new RVAR template—through December 2016. GAO found that regions did not consistently obtain and document information for the elements required under the six regulatory factors (see table). For example, only 44 of the 81 RVARs documented all elements under the concentration of damage factor. By evaluating why regions are not completing all elements of each current IA regulatory factor, FEMA could identify whether any corrective steps are needed. Officials from the 10 FEMA regions and 11 states GAO interviewed, reported positive relationships with each other, but also cited various challenges with the IA declaration process and regulatory factors. For example, these officials told GAO that there are no established minimum thresholds for IA, making final determinations more subjective and the rationale behind denials unclear. However, as required by the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013, FEMA has taken steps to revise the IA factors by issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking. According to FEMA, the proposed rule aims to provide more objective criteria, clarify the threshold for eligibility, and speed up the IA declaration process. As of April 2018, the proposed rule was still under consideration. According to FEMA officials, they plan to finalize the rule in late 2018; therefore, it is too early to know the extent to which it will address these challenges.

Estimation of improper payments is key to understanding the extent of the problem and to developing effective corrective actions. Relevant laws and guidance provide agencies flexibility in developing estimates. This report describes agencies' processes to estimate improper payments in selected programs for fiscal year 2017 and the extent to which certain differences in these processes can affect the usefulness of the resulting estimates. GAO selected 10 programs across six agencies with the largest reported program outlays in fiscal years 2015 and 2016. For these programs, GAO reviewed relevant laws and guidance, analyzed agencies' policies and procedures, and interviewed officials at relevant agencies and OMB staff. The six agencies GAO reviewed reported taking various approaches related to key components of estimating improper payments—shown in the figure below—for 10 selected programs, which collectively reported outlays of over $2.5 trillion for fiscal year 2017. Sample selection. Eight of the 10 programs GAO reviewed reported using statistically valid approaches, and the remaining 2 reported using alternative methodologies approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The sampled data elements varied, including payments, medical claims, and tax returns. The age of the data used to develop fiscal year 2017 improper payment estimates also varied, ranging from calendar year 2013 to fiscal year 2017. Identification of improper payments. Some of the six agencies reported using processes designed specifically to estimate improper payments, whereas others reported leveraging existing reviews. These agencies' policies and procedures include a review of aspects of eligibility, except for those related to the Department of Defense's (DOD) Military Pay and the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) Retirement overpayments. DOD and OPM have not fully assessed whether their estimation processes effectively consider key program risks. OMB guidance does not specifically address how agencies are to test to identify improper payments, such as using a risk-based approach to help ensure that key risks of improper payments are addressed. The six agencies also varied in the treatment of insufficient documentation, both in identifying and in reporting the root causes of improper payments. For the agencies that contact entities outside the agency to estimate improper payments, the treatment of nonresponse differed, with one agency including nonresponses as improper payments and another generally excluding the nonresponse cases from review. Although OMB guidance states that agencies should treat cases of insufficient documentation as improper payments, it does not specifically address the treatment of nonresponse cases. Calculation of the improper payment estimate. The six agencies generally reported using law and OMB guidance to calculate improper payment estimates for the selected programs, except for the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) removed overpayments that were recovered when developing its estimate. OMB guidance requires agencies to include recovered amounts in their estimates. Removing these overpayments understates the EITC improper payment estimate and may limit IRS's ability to develop corrective actions to prevent improper payments. GAO recommends that OMB develop guidance on treatment of nonresponse cases and testing to identify improper payments, that DOD and OPM assess their estimation processes, and that IRS revise its methodology to not exclude recovered payments from its estimate.

The fund also receives mandatory appropriations under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (GOMESA). The level of annual appropriations for the LWCF has varied since the origin of the fund in FY1965. The LWCF Act outlines uses of the fund for federal and state purposes. Of the total made available through appropriations or deposits under GOMESA, not less than 40% is to be used for \"federal purposes\" and not less than 40% is to be used to provide \"financial assistance to states.\" The act lists the federal purposes for which the President is to allot LWCF funds \"unless otherwise allotted in the appropriation Act making them available.\" These purposes primarily relate to acquisition of lands and waters (and interests therein) by the federal government. With regard to state purposes, the act authorizes a matching grant program to states for outdoor recreation purposes. Throughout the LWCF's history, appropriations acts typically have provided funds for land acquisition and outdoor recreational grants to states. Beginning in FY1998, appropriations also have been provided each year (except FY1999) to fund other purposes related to natural resources. The extent to which the LWCF should be used for purposes other than federal land acquisition and outdoor recreation grants to states, and which other purposes should be funded from the LWCF, continue to be the subject of legislation and debate in Congress. In the past few decades, Presidents have sought LWCF funds for a variety of other purposes. Congress chooses which if any of these requests to fund, and has chosen programs not sought by the President for a particular year. Among other programs, appropriations have been provided for facility maintenance of the land management agencies, ecosystem restoration, the Historic Preservation Fund, the Payments in Lieu of Taxes program, the Forest Legacy Program, State and Tribal Wildlife Grants (under the Fish and Wildlife Service), the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund, U.S. Geological Survey science and cooperative programs, and Bureau of Indian Affairs Indian Land and Water Claim Settlements. Since FY1998, a total of $2.7 billion has been appropriated for other purposes, of a total LWCF appropriation of $18.9 billion over the history of the fund.

Several agencies shared the remaining $0.2 billion (9%) of the appropriations. Both the dollar amounts and the percentages of annual LWCF appropriations for other purposes have varied widely since FY1998. The dollar amounts have ranged from $0 in FY1999 to $456.0 million in FY2001. The percentage of annual funds provided for other purposes ranged from 0% in FY1999 to a high of 59% in both FY2006 and FY2007.

The Railroad Retirement Act (RRA) authorizes retirement, disability, and survivor benefits for railroad workers and their families. RRA is financed primarily by payroll taxes, financial interchanges from Social Security, and transfers from the National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust (NRRIT). Railroad retirement payroll taxes have two tiers: the Tier I tax is essentially the same as the Social Security payroll tax and the Tier II tax is set each year based on the railroad retirement system's asset balances, benefit payments, and administrative costs. In FY2017, the gross RRA funding was about $12.7 billion. Railroad retirement annuities are also divided into two tiers. Tier I annuities are designed to be nearly equivalent to Social Security benefits and are based on both railroad retirement and Social Security-covered employment. However, Tier I annuities are more generous than Social Security benefits in certain situations. For example, at the age of 60, railroad workers with at least 30 years of covered railroad work may receive unreduced retirement annuities.

Exceptions are made under the act, including for activities involving \"the safety of human life or the protection of property.\" The interval during the fiscal year when appropriations for a particular project or activity are not enacted into law, either in the form of a regular appropriations act or a continuing resolution (CR), is referred to as a funding gap or funding lapse. Although funding gaps may occur at the start of the fiscal year, they may also occur any time a CR expires and another CR (or the regular appropriations bill) is not enacted immediately thereafter. Multiple funding gaps may occur within a fiscal year. When a funding gap occurs, federal agencies are generally required to begin a shutdown of the affected projects and activities, which includes the prompt furlough of non-excepted personnel. The general practice of the federal government after the shutdown has ended has been to retroactively pay furloughed employees for the time they missed, as well as employees who were required to come to work. Although a shutdown may be the result of a funding gap, the two events should be distinguished. This is because a funding gap may result in a total shutdown of all affected projects or activities in some instances but not others. For example, when funding gaps are of a short duration, agencies may not have enough time to complete a shutdown of affected projects and activities before funding is restored. In addition, the Office of Management and Budget has previously indicated that a shutdown of agency operations within the first day of the funding gap may be postponed if a resolution appears to be imminent. Since FY1977, 20 funding gaps occurred, ranging in duration from 1 day to 34 full days. These funding gaps are listed in Table 1. About half of these funding gaps were brief (i.e., three days or less in duration). Notably, many of the funding gaps do not appear to have resulted in a \"shutdown.\" Prior to the issuance of the opinions in 1980 and early 1981 by then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti, while agencies tended to curtail some operations in response to a funding gap, they often \"continued to operate during periods of expired funding.\" In addition, some of the funding gaps after the Civiletti opinions did not result in a completion of shutdown operations due to both the funding gap's short duration and an expectation that appropriations would soon be enacted. Some of the funding gaps during this period, however, did have a broader impact on affected government operations, even if only for a matter of hours. Two funding gaps occurred in FY1996, amounting to 5 days and 21 days. The chronology of regular and continuing appropriations enacted during FY1996 is illustrated in Figure 1.

The extent to which each of these four federal agencies have authority to acquire and dispose of land varies considerably. The BLM has relatively broad authority for both acquisitions and disposals under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA). The agency also has other authorities for disposing of land, including two laws that allow the agency to retain the proceeds for subsequent land acquisition, among other purposes, and a law that allows transfers to governmental units and other entities for public purposes. By contrast, the NPS has no general authority to acquire land to create new park units or to dispose of park lands. The FS authority to acquire lands is mostly limited to lands within or contiguous to the boundaries of a national forest. The agency has various authorities to dispose of land, but they are relatively constrained and infrequently used. The FWS has various authorities to acquire lands but no general authority to dispose of its lands. The agency frequently uses acquisition authority under the Migratory Bird Conservation Act of 1929 because of the availability of funding through the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund. The nature of the acquisition and disposal authorities of the four federal agencies also varies. In general, the acquisition authorities are designed to allow the four agencies to bring into federal ownership lands that many contend could benefit from federal management. Disposal authorities generally are designed to allow agencies to convey land that is no longer needed for a federal purpose or that might be chiefly valuable for another purpose. Some of the authorities specify particular circumstances where they can be used, such as the conveyance of FS land for educational purposes and the disposal of BLM land for recreation and public purposes. Congress often faces questions on the adequacy of existing acquisition and disposal authorities; the nature, extent, and location of their use; and the extent of federal land ownership overall. The current acquisition and disposal authorities form the backdrop for consideration of measures to establish, modify, or eliminate authorities, or to provide for the acquisition or disposal of particular lands. In some cases, Congress enacts bills to provide authority to acquire or dispose of particular parcels where no standing authority exists and, in other cases, to direct or facilitate land transactions. Congress also addresses acquisition and disposal policy in the context of debates on the role and goals of the federal government in owning and managing land generally, and it has considered broader measures to dispose of lands or to promote acquisition. Other issues for Congress pertain to the sources and levels of funds for land acquisition. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) is the primary source of funding for land acquisition. Congress has considered diverse measures related to the LWCF, such as legislation to make LWCF funding permanent and bills to direct LWCF monies to additional, nonacquisition purposes.

{"pred": " \nThe United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has obligated over $5 billion in assistance to the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza since 1993. The majority of this assistance was provided through the Economic Support Fund (ESF) and was used for projects related to private sector development, health, water and road infrastructure, local governance, civil society, rule of law, education, and youth development. USAID's assistance aimed to build a more democratic, stable, prosperous, and secure Palestinian society. The agency's antiterrorism policies and procedures ensured that assistance did not inadvertently support entities or individuals associated with terrorism. As of March 31, 2018, USAID had obligated about $544.1 million and expended about $350.6 million of approximately $544.5 million in ESF assistance allocated for the West Bank and Gaza in fiscal years 2015 and 2016. The largest share of USAID's ESF project assistance supported the agency's Economic Growth and Infrastructure development objective, which included projects such as the Architecture and Engineering Services project to rehabilitate and construct infrastructure. The second-largest share supported the agency's Investing in the Next Generation development objective, which included projects such as a grant to the World Food Program for assistance to vulnerable groups. USAID also made direct payments to PA creditors totaling about $75 million from fiscal year 2015 funds and $70 million from fiscal year 2016 funds. The agency vetted each PA creditor that received payments and completed the vetting during the 12-month period before the debt relief agreements with the PA were signed. USAID's external assessments and financial audits of the PA Ministries of Health and Finance and Planning identified weaknesses in both systems, but the agency took steps to mitigate these findings. Overall, USAID's assistance to the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza aimed to promote economic growth, improve governance, and support the development of a more democratic and prosperous society. The agency's antiterrorism policies and procedures ensured that assistance was used effectively and efficiently. \n\nThe Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) Act of 1965 was enacted to \"assist in preserving, developing, and assuring accessibility to... outdoor recreation resources.\" The fund is authorized to receive $900 million in revenues annually, but the majority of its revenues have not been appropriated.

According to the Department of State, this assistance to the Palestinians promotes U.S. economic and political foreign policy interests by supporting Middle East peace negotiations and financing economic stabilization programs. USAID is primarily responsible for administering ESF assistance to the West Bank and Gaza. Appropriations acts for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 included provisions for GAO to review the treatment, handling, and uses of funds provided through the ESF for assistance to the West Bank and Gaza. This report examines (1) the status of ESF assistance and projects provided to the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016, including project assistance and payments to PA creditors, and (2) the extent to which USAID conducted required vetting of PA creditors to ensure that this assistance would not support entities or individuals associated with terrorism and assessed PA ministries' capacity to use ESF assistance as intended. GAO reviewed relevant laws and regulations and USAID financial data, policies, procedures, and documents. GAO also interviewed USAID and State Department officials. As of March 2018, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) had allocated about $545 million of funding appropriated to the Economic Support Fund (ESF) for assistance in the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016. USAID obligated about $544 million (over 99 percent) and expended about $351 million (over 64 percent) of the total allocations. Project assistance accounted for approximately $399 million of the obligated funds, while payments to Palestinian Authority (PA) creditors accounted for $145 million (see figure). USAID's obligations for project assistance in the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 supported three development objectives—Economic Growth and Infrastructure ($239 million), Investing in the Next Generation ($107 million), and Governance and Civic Engagement (about $25 million). In fiscal years 2015 and 2016, USAID made payments directly to PA creditors—two Israeli fuel companies, to cover debts for petroleum purchases, and a local Palestinian bank, to pay off a line of credit used for PA medical referrals to six hospitals in the East Jerusalem Hospital network. USAID vetted PA creditors to ensure that the program assistance would not provide support to entities or individuals associated with terrorism and also conducted external assessments and financial audits of PA ministries of Health and Finance and Planning. USAID documentation showed that, as required, officials checked the vetting status of each PA creditor within 12 months before USAID signed its debt relief grant agreements with the PA. In addition, although USAID determined that it was not legally required to assess the PA Ministry of Health's medical referral services and the Ministry of Finance and Planning's petroleum procurement system, the agency commissioned external assessments of both ministries. These assessments found some weaknesses in both ministries' systems; however, USAID mission officials stated that these weaknesses did not affect USAID debt relief payments to the PA creditors. Nevertheless, USAID took additional steps to mitigate the identified weaknesses. For example, a USAID contractor worked with the Ministry of Health to update, revise, and approve guidelines for medical referrals. In addition, USAID commissioned financial audits of the debt relief grant agreements between USAID and the PA for direct payments to PA creditors in fiscal year 2015 and 2016. The audits did not identify any ineligible costs, reportable material weaknesses in internal control, or material instances of noncompliance with the terms of the agreements.

{"pred": " \nThe House of Representatives has a procedure called suspension of the rules, which allows for the expedited consideration of nonprivileged legislation. This procedure is typically used for broadly supported legislation that can be approved without extensive debate or floor amendments. The suspension procedure requires a two-thirds vote and is usually reserved for bills and resolutions that can meet a supermajority threshold. In the 114th Congress, 62% of all measures that received floor action were considered under suspension, with most being bills sponsored by members of the majority party. Suspension measures are not subject to floor amendments, but committees may recommend amendments during markup meetings or through informal negotiations. The procedure is often used for measures that are likely to achieve a two-thirds majority threshold for passage, with almost all suspension measures being passed by the House in the 114th Congress. The Senate, however, may not pass suspension measures that receive the requisite two-thirds majority in the House, and some measures may not become public law due to differences between the House and Senate versions. Overall, the suspension of the rules procedure is an important tool for the House of Representatives to expedite the consideration of legislation, but it is not a guarantee of passage in the Senate. \n\nThe Congressional Research Service report discusses the most frequently asked questions received on Fire Management Assistance Grants (FMAGs). FMAGs provide federal assistance for fire suppression activities and are requested by states when a fire is burning out of control and threatens to become a major disaster. The request must include cost estimates and information about the fire, and the FMAG declaration is evaluated using thresholds, including the threat to lives and property, availability of state and local fire resources, and potential economic impacts. The report also discusses the types of assistance provided under an FMAG declaration, including reimbursement for eligible expenses such as equipment, supplies, and personnel. The report notes that FMAGs are funded through FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund and are not contingent on the DRF balance. The report also discusses the cost-share for FMAGs, which is based on a federal share of 75% of eligible expenses, and the process for submitting grant applications and receiving reimbursement. Overall, the report provides an overview of the FMAG program and its key features. \n\nNote: The summary is limited to one page and focuses on the most important information from the passages.

As the name suggests, the procedure allows the House to suspend its standing and statutory rules in order to consider broadly supported legislation in an expedited manner. More specifically, the House temporarily sets aside its rules that govern the raising and consideration of measures and assumes a new set of constraints particular to the suspension procedure. The suspension of the rules procedure has several parliamentary advantages: (1) it allows nonprivileged measures to be raised on the House floor without the need for a special rule, (2) it enables the consideration of measures that would otherwise be subject to a point of order, and (3) it streamlines floor action by limiting debate and prohibiting floor amendments. Given these features, as well as the required two-thirds supermajority vote for passage, suspension motions are generally used to process less controversial legislation. In the 114th Congress (2015-2016), measures considered under suspension made up 62% of the bills and resolutions that received floor action in the House (743 out of 1,200 measures). The majority of suspension measures were House bills (83%), followed by Senate bills (11%) and House resolutions (4%). The measures covered a variety of policy areas but most often addressed government operations, such as the designation of federal facilities or amending administrative policies. Most measures that are considered in the House under the suspension procedure are sponsored by a House or Senate majority party member. However, suspension is the most common House procedure used to consider minority-party-sponsored legislation regardless of whether the legislation originated in the House or Senate. In 2015 and 2016, minority-party members sponsored 31% of suspension measures, compared to 9% of legislation subject to different procedures, including privileged business (17 measures), unanimous consent (21 measures), and under the terms of a special rule (one Senate bill). Most suspension measures are referred to at least one House committee before their consideration on the floor. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform (now called the Committee on Oversight and Reform) was the committee of primary jurisdiction for the plurality of suspension measures considered in the 114th Congress. Additional committees—such as Energy and Commerce, Homeland Security, Natural Resources, Foreign Affairs, and Veterans' Affairs—also served as the primary committee for a large number of suspension measures. Suspension motions are debatable for up to 40 minutes. In most cases, only a fraction of that debate time is actually used. In the 114th Congress, the average amount of time spent considering a motion to suspend the rules was 13 minutes and 10 seconds. The House adopted nearly every suspension motion considered in 2015 and 2016. Approval by the House, however, did not guarantee final approval in the 114th Congress. The Senate passed or agreed to 40% of the bills, joint resolutions, and concurrent resolutions initially considered in the House under suspension of the rules, and 276 measures were signed into law. This report briefly describes the suspension of the rules procedure, which is defined in House Rule XV, and provides an analysis of measures considered under this procedure during the 114th Congress.

The system can track and classify missile threats, and its location at Shemya Island, Alaska, allows it to track threats from North Korea earlier than other radar systems. However, the system's capabilities are limited, and it does not have the ability to determine if a missile threat is successfully intercepted. The Air Force and Missile Defense Agency (MDA) are working to modernize the system, but challenges remain, including the need to redesign critical parts and the risk of unscheduled downtime. The DOD plans to share funding with the Air Force to operate and sustain the system, and the Air Force has identified a need to provide $140 million in funding for the sustainment and maintenance of the system's site at Shemya Island. Overall, the Cobra Dane radar system is a critical component of the DOD's ballistic missile defense mission, but its limitations and challenges highlight the need for continued investment and modernization.

Anticipating future needs, DOD began investing in new radar systems that share capabilities with Cobra Dane to support ballistic missile defense and space surveillance, including the LRDR (Alaska), the Space Fence (Marshall Islands), and the Pacific Radar (location to be determined). The conference report accompanying a bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 included a provision that GAO review the Air Force's report to Congress on the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane. This report identifies information included in the Air Force's report and describes additional information that GAO reviewed on (1) the capabilities of the Cobra Dane radar and other planned radars to meet DOD's mission requirements, (2) Cobra Dane's operational availability and the plan to mitigate the effect on those missions when Cobra Dane is not available, and (3) DOD's funding plan and project cost estimates for the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane and its site at Shemya Island. GAO reviewed the Air Force report and related documentation, and interviewed relevant officials. In its January 2018 report to Congress, the Air Force reported how the Cobra Dane radar and the Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR) have shared and unique capabilities to support ballistic missile defense and space surveillance missions. The report noted that the respective locations of both radar systems affect their ability to provide those capabilities. The Department of Defense (DOD) also has other radar investments—the Pacific Radar and the Space Fence, which, according to DOD officials, may reduce DOD's reliance on Cobra Dane to provide ballistic missile defense and space surveillance capabilities. The Air Force's report to Congress noted that Cobra Dane met its requirement for operational availability, which refers to the percentage of time that the radar is able to meet its missions. GAO found that the Air Force has developed procedures to mitigate risks when Cobra Dane is not available. For example, U.S. Northern Command and Missile Defense Agency (MDA) officials stated that they can mitigate risks when Cobra Dane is not available by using the Sea-Based X-band radar to provide support for ballistic missile defense. The Air Force would face some limitations in its ability to conduct space surveillance if Cobra Dane were not available, as Cobra Dane tracks objects no other radar can track. However, MDA officials noted there are no plans to take Cobra Dane offline long enough to compromise space surveillance. The Air Force and MDA plan to contribute total funding of $278.6 million for the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane, according to their fiscal year 2019 budget plans. Specifically, the Air Force and MDA plan to share funding for the operation and maintenance of the Cobra Dane radar and for three modernization projects that make up their sustainment plan for the radar. Further, the Air Force report noted that the Air Force also plans to provide $140 million in funding for the sustainment and maintenance of operational access to Cobra Dane's site at Shemya Island. In addition, GAO found that the Air Force developed a total cost estimate for one project—known as the transmitter group replacement—but not for its other two projects.

The fund receives $900 million annually, but only a portion of this amount is appropriated by Congress. The LWCF has a balance of $22 billion, with $18.9 billion appropriated since its inception. The majority of appropriations have been for federal land acquisition and state grants for outdoor recreation. However, some appropriations have been used for other purposes, such as facility maintenance, ecosystem restoration, and the Historic Preservation Fund. The two programs that have received the most funding for other purposes are the Forest Legacy Program and the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund, with a total of $1.7 billion since FY1998. The LWCF has been used to fund a variety of programs, but the majority of appropriations have been for land acquisition and state grants.

The LWCF Act authorizes the fund to receive $900 million annually, with the monies available only if appropriated by Congress (i.e., discretionary appropriations). The fund also receives mandatory appropriations under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (GOMESA). The level of annual appropriations for the LWCF has varied since the origin of the fund in FY1965. The LWCF Act outlines uses of the fund for federal and state purposes. Of the total made available through appropriations or deposits under GOMESA, not less than 40% is to be used for \"federal purposes\" and not less than 40% is to be used to provide \"financial assistance to states.\" The act lists the federal purposes for which the President is to allot LWCF funds \"unless otherwise allotted in the appropriation Act making them available.\" These purposes primarily relate to acquisition of lands and waters (and interests therein) by the federal government. With regard to state purposes, the act authorizes a matching grant program to states for outdoor recreation purposes. Throughout the LWCF's history, appropriations acts typically have provided funds for land acquisition and outdoor recreational grants to states. Beginning in FY1998, appropriations also have been provided each year (except FY1999) to fund other purposes related to natural resources. The extent to which the LWCF should be used for purposes other than federal land acquisition and outdoor recreation grants to states, and which other purposes should be funded from the LWCF, continue to be the subject of legislation and debate in Congress. In the past few decades, Presidents have sought LWCF funds for a variety of other purposes. Congress chooses which if any of these requests to fund, and has chosen programs not sought by the President for a particular year. Among other programs, appropriations have been provided for facility maintenance of the land management agencies, ecosystem restoration, the Historic Preservation Fund, the Payments in Lieu of Taxes program, the Forest Legacy Program, State and Tribal Wildlife Grants (under the Fish and Wildlife Service), the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund, U.S. Geological Survey science and cooperative programs, and Bureau of Indian Affairs Indian Land and Water Claim Settlements. Since FY1998, a total of $2.7 billion has been appropriated for other purposes, of a total LWCF appropriation of $18.9 billion over the history of the fund. The Fish and Wildlife Service and the Forest Service have received the largest shares of the total appropriations for other purposes, about $1.4 billion (53%) and $1.0.billion (38%), respectively, from FY1998 to FY2019. Several agencies shared the remaining $0.2 billion (9%) of the appropriations. Both the dollar amounts and the percentages of annual LWCF appropriations for other purposes have varied widely since FY1998. The dollar amounts have ranged from $0 in FY1999 to $456.0 million in FY2001. The percentage of annual funds provided for other purposes ranged from 0% in FY1999 to a high of 59% in both FY2006 and FY2007. In some years, the appropriation for other purposes was significantly less than the Administration requested. For instance, for FY2008, the George W. Bush Administration sought $313.1 million; the appropriation was $101.3 million. The appropriation for other purposes last exceeded $100.0 million in FY2010, and most recently was $93.3 million, in FY2019. Prior to FY2008, several other purposes typically were funded each year from LWCF. Since FY2008, funds have been appropriated annually only for grants under two programs: Forest Legacy and Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund. These two programs and a third grant program—State and Tribal Wildlife Grants—have received more than three-quarters ($2.1 billion, 79%) of the total appropriation for other purposes since FY1998."], "length": 6590}
{"pred": " \nPassage 2 discusses the concept of funding gaps in the federal government, which occur when appropriations for a particular project or activity are not enacted into law. The passage explains that funding gaps can result in a shutdown of affected projects and activities, including the furlough of non-excepted personnel. The main argument of the passage is that funding gaps are a common occurrence in the federal government, with 20 funding gaps occurring since FY1977. The passage highlights the importance of understanding the impact of funding gaps on government operations and the need for a more efficient and effective appropriations process. Key evidence presented includes data on the duration and frequency of funding gaps, as well as examples of recent funding gaps, including those in FY1996, FY2014, FY2018, and FY2019. The passage also notes that the Office of Management and Budget has previously indicated that a shutdown of agency operations within the first day of a funding gap may be postponed if it appears that an additional CR or regular appropriations act is likely to be enacted that same day. Overall, the passage provides a comprehensive overview of the concept of funding gaps and their impact on the federal government. The unique point made in the passage is that funding gaps can have a significant impact on government operations, even if only for a short period of time, and that a more efficient and effective appropriations process is needed to prevent these gaps. The passage also highlights the importance of understanding the impact of funding gaps on government operations and the need for a more efficient and effective appropriations process.

Exceptions are made under the act, including for activities involving \"the safety of human life or the protection of property.\" The interval during the fiscal year when appropriations for a particular project or activity are not enacted into law, either in the form of a regular appropriations act or a continuing resolution (CR), is referred to as a funding gap or funding lapse. Although funding gaps may occur at the start of the fiscal year, they may also occur any time a CR expires and another CR (or the regular appropriations bill) is not enacted immediately thereafter. Multiple funding gaps may occur within a fiscal year. When a funding gap occurs, federal agencies are generally required to begin a shutdown of the affected projects and activities, which includes the prompt furlough of non-excepted personnel. The general practice of the federal government after the shutdown has ended has been to retroactively pay furloughed employees for the time they missed, as well as employees who were required to come to work. Although a shutdown may be the result of a funding gap, the two events should be distinguished. This is because a funding gap may result in a total shutdown of all affected projects or activities in some instances but not others. For example, when funding gaps are of a short duration, agencies may not have enough time to complete a shutdown of affected projects and activities before funding is restored. In addition, the Office of Management and Budget has previously indicated that a shutdown of agency operations within the first day of the funding gap may be postponed if a resolution appears to be imminent. Since FY1977, 20 funding gaps occurred, ranging in duration from 1 day to 34 full days. These funding gaps are listed in Table 1. About half of these funding gaps were brief (i.e., three days or less in duration). Notably, many of the funding gaps do not appear to have resulted in a \"shutdown.\" Prior to the issuance of the opinions in 1980 and early 1981 by then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti, while agencies tended to curtail some operations in response to a funding gap, they often \"continued to operate during periods of expired funding.\" In addition, some of the funding gaps after the Civiletti opinions did not result in a completion of shutdown operations due to both the funding gap's short duration and an expectation that appropriations would soon be enacted. Some of the funding gaps during this period, however, did have a broader impact on affected government operations, even if only for a matter of hours. Two funding gaps occurred in FY1996, amounting to 5 days and 21 days. The chronology of regular and continuing appropriations enacted during FY1996 is illustrated in Figure 1. At the beginning of FY2014 (October 1, 2013), none of the regular appropriations bills had been enacted, so a government-wide funding gap occurred. It concluded on October 17, 2013, after lasting 16 full days. During FY2018, there was a funding gap when a CR covering all of the regular appropriations bills expired on January 19, 2018. It concluded on January 22, 2018, after lasting two full days. The most recent funding gap occurred during FY2019, when a CR covering federal agencies and activities funded in 7 of the 12 regular appropriations bills expired on December 21, 2018. It concluded on January 25, 2019, after lasting 34 full days.

{"pred": " \nThe confirmation process for presidential nominations in the US Senate serves several purposes, including examining the qualifications of nominees and influencing policy through the confirmation process. The Senate considers approximately 65,000 military appointments and promotions, 2,000 civilian nominations, and federal judges and specified officers in executive departments, independent agencies, and regulatory boards and commissions each Congress. The Senate may approve en bloc hundreds of nominations at a time, especially military appointments and promotions, and allows for close scrutiny of candidates when necessary. The confirmation process is influenced by the President's party affiliation, with Senators of the President's party often consulted prior to choosing a nominee and sometimes invited to express opinions or even propose candidates for federal appointments in their own states. The Senate has made several changes to the confirmation process since 2011, including the ability to request that a nomination be referred to a committee at any time that the nomination is listed in the Executive Calendar. The Senate also has the power to discharge a committee from consideration of an unreported nomination by unanimous consent, and can reverse a decision by the Presiding Officer on a cloture motion. The Senate has reinterpreted Senate Rule XXII to reduce the maximum time allowed for consideration of most nominations after cloture is invoked from 30 hours to 2 hours. This change is expected to decrease the time between a cloture vote and a confirmation vote, and may affect how often the Senate relies on the cloture process to approve nominations. The Senate can waive the rule requiring nominations to be returned to the President at the end of a session or when the Senate adjourns or recesses for more than 30 days by unanimous consent, and can also exempt specific nominees by name from the unanimous consent agreement. The Constitution grants the President the authority to fill temporarily vacancies that \"may happen during the Recess of the Senate\" without Senate confirmation. Recess appointments have sometimes been controversial and have occasionally led to inter-branch conflict. The Senate's confirmation process is a complex and multifaceted system that serves several purposes, including examining the qualifications of nominees and influencing policy through the confirmation process. The process is influenced by the President's party affiliation, and the Senate has made several changes to the process since 2011. The Senate's power to discharge a committee from consideration of an unreported nomination and to reverse a decision by the Presiding Officer on a cloture motion are key aspects of the confirmation process.

Committees play the central role in the process through investigations and hearings. Senate Rule XXXI provides that nominations shall be referred to appropriate committees \"unless otherwise ordered.\" Most nominations are referred, although a Senate standing order provides that some \"privileged\" nominations to specified positions will not be referred unless requested by a Senator. The Senate rule concerning committee jurisdictions (Rule XXV) broadly defines issue areas for committees, and the same jurisdictional statements generally apply to nominations as well as legislation. A committee often gathers information about a nominee either before or instead of a formal hearing. A committee considering a nomination has four options. It can report the nomination to the Senate favorably, unfavorably, or without recommendation, or it can choose to take no action. It is more common for a committee to take no action on a nomination than to reject a nominee outright. The Senate handles executive business, which includes both nominations and treaties, separately from its legislative business. All nominations reported from committee are listed on the Executive Calendar, a separate document from the Calendar of Business, which lists pending bills and resolutions. Generally speaking, the majority leader schedules floor consideration of nominations on the Calendar. Nominations are considered in \"executive session,\" a parliamentary form of the Senate in session that has its own journal and, to some extent, its own rules of procedure. The Senate can call up a nomination expeditiously, because a motion to enter executive session to consider a specific nomination on the Calendar is not debatable. This motion requires a majority of Senators present and voting, a quorum being present, for approval. After a nomination has been called up, the question before the Senate is \"will the Senate advise and consent to this nomination?\" A majority of Senators voting is required to approve a nomination. However, Senate rules place no limit on how long a nomination may be debated, and ending consideration could require invoking cloture. On April 6, 2017, the Senate reinterpreted Rule XXII in order to allow cloture to be invoked on nominations to the Supreme Court by a majority of Senators voting. This expanded the results of similar actions taken by the Senate in November 2013, which changed the cloture vote requirement to a majority for nominations other than to the Supreme Court. After the 2013 decision, the number of nominations subjected to a cloture process increased. On April 3, 2019, the Senate reinterpreted Rule XXII again. The Senate reduced, from 30 hours to 2 hours, the maximum time nominations can be considered after cloture has been invoked. This change applied to all executive branch nominations except to high-level positions such as heads of departments, and it applied to all judicial nominations except to the Supreme Court and the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The full impact of this change is difficult to assess at this time, but it is likely to shorten the time between a cloture vote and a vote on the nomination. If Senators respond as they did to the last reinterpretation of the cloture rule, it might also increase the number of nominations subjected to a cloture process. Nominations that are pending when the Senate adjourns sine die at the end of a session or recesses for more than 30 days are returned to the President unless the Senate, by unanimous consent, waives the rule requiring their return (Senate Rule XXXI, clause 6). If a nomination is returned, and the President still desires Senate consideration, he must submit a new nomination."], "length": 6672}

The agencies have varying authorities to acquire and dispose of land, with the Bureau of Land Management having the broadest authority. The acquisition authorities are designed to allow federal agencies to acquire lands that benefit from federal management, while disposal authorities allow agencies to dispose of land no longer required for federal purposes. The federal government faces questions on the adequacy of existing acquisition and disposal authorities, with Congress considering measures to establish, modify, or eliminate these authorities. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) is the principal financing mechanism for federal land acquisition, with Congress determining the level of appropriations each year. The four federal land management agencies have different standing authorities for acquiring and disposing of lands, with the National Park Service having the narrowest authorities and the Bureau of Land Management having the broadest. The agencies' acquisition and disposal authorities are subject to various laws and regulations, with some authorities allowing for the exchange of lands, sales, or transfers to other entities. The federal government's land ownership and management policies remain controversial, with some advocating for the divestment of federal lands and others supporting the retention of lands in federal ownership. The LWCF has expired, and its reauthorization is a topic of debate, with some proposing permanent reauthorization and others seeking to direct a portion of funding to specific purposes. The federal government's land acquisition and disposal policies are complex and multifaceted, with various laws and regulations governing the agencies' authorities. The Bureau of Land Management has broad authority to acquire and dispose of land, while the National Park Service has limited authority to dispose of land.

Four agencies—the National Park Service (NPS), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in the Department of the Interior, and the U.S. Forest Service (FS) in the Department of Agriculture—administer about 95% of those lands. The extent to which each of these four federal agencies have authority to acquire and dispose of land varies considerably. The BLM has relatively broad authority for both acquisitions and disposals under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA). The agency also has other authorities for disposing of land, including two laws that allow the agency to retain the proceeds for subsequent land acquisition, among other purposes, and a law that allows transfers to governmental units and other entities for public purposes. By contrast, the NPS has no general authority to acquire land to create new park units or to dispose of park lands. The FS authority to acquire lands is mostly limited to lands within or contiguous to the boundaries of a national forest. The agency has various authorities to dispose of land, but they are relatively constrained and infrequently used. The FWS has various authorities to acquire lands but no general authority to dispose of its lands. The agency frequently uses acquisition authority under the Migratory Bird Conservation Act of 1929 because of the availability of funding through the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund. The nature of the acquisition and disposal authorities of the four federal agencies also varies. In general, the acquisition authorities are designed to allow the four agencies to bring into federal ownership lands that many contend could benefit from federal management. Disposal authorities generally are designed to allow agencies to convey land that is no longer needed for a federal purpose or that might be chiefly valuable for another purpose. Some of the authorities specify particular circumstances where they can be used, such as the conveyance of FS land for educational purposes and the disposal of BLM land for recreation and public purposes. Congress often faces questions on the adequacy of existing acquisition and disposal authorities; the nature, extent, and location of their use; and the extent of federal land ownership overall. The current acquisition and disposal authorities form the backdrop for consideration of measures to establish, modify, or eliminate authorities, or to provide for the acquisition or disposal of particular lands. In some cases, Congress enacts bills to provide authority to acquire or dispose of particular parcels where no standing authority exists and, in other cases, to direct or facilitate land transactions. Congress also addresses acquisition and disposal policy in the context of debates on the role and goals of the federal government in owning and managing land generally, and it has considered broader measures to dispose of lands or to promote acquisition. Other issues for Congress pertain to the sources and levels of funds for land acquisition. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) is the primary source of funding for land acquisition. Congress has considered diverse measures related to the LWCF, such as legislation to make LWCF funding permanent and bills to direct LWCF monies to additional, nonacquisition purposes.

{"pred": " Passage 1\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) regulates the disposal of controlled substances through its administration and enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act. The DEA allows the public to deliver unused controlled substances to authorized collectors, such as pharmacies, for disposal. As of April 2017, only about 2.5% of eligible entities had registered to use disposal bins to collect unused prescription drugs. The main reasons for low participation rates include the associated costs of participating, uncertainty over proper implementation, and participation in other, similar efforts for disposing of unused prescription drugs. The DEA has provided guidance on the disposal of controlled substances, but stakeholders have raised concerns about the agency's communication and guidance to authorized collectors. The availability of disposal options at law enforcement agencies contributes to the low participation rates among pharmacies as authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs. The DEA has not collected information on the extent to which individuals use its prescription drug disposal bins, but estimates suggest that about half of the country's population lives within 5 miles of a disposal bin. The DEA's regulations require that all controlled substances collected in the disposal bin's inner liners must be destroyed in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local laws and rendered non-retrievable. Authorized collectors are permitted to destroy the inner liner on their premises if they have the capacity to do so. If not, the inner liners can be transported to a separate location to be destroyed. The DEA's website contains a public search feature to identify authorized collectors located near a specific zip code or address. The DEA has not collected information on the amount and types of prescription drugs destroyed through the disposal bins. The agency views its responsibility solely as giving pharmacies and other eligible entities the opportunity to become authorized collectors.

Also contributing", "answers": ["In 2015, 3.8 million Americans reported misusing prescription drugs within the last month, and deaths from prescription opioids have more than quadrupled since 1999. About half of the people who reported misusing prescription drugs in 2015 received them from a friend or relative. One way to help prevent this kind of diversion and potential misuse is by providing secure and convenient ways to dispose of unused, unneeded, or expired prescription medications. The Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010 authorizes pharmacies and other entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances to also collect unused prescription drugs for disposal. In 2014, DEA finalized regulations for the implementation of the Act, establishing a voluntary process for eligible entities to become authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs using disposal bins. GAO was asked to review participation among authorized collectors that maintain disposal bins. In this report GAO describes (1) participation rates among entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs and (2) factors that affect participation. GAO analyzed the most currently available DEA data from April 2017 on entities eligible to participate and those participating as authorized collectors. GAO also conducted interviews with DEA officials and a nongeneralizable sample of 11 stakeholder organizations selected to illustrate different types of authorized collectors and long-term care facilities. GAO is not making any recommendations. DEA provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. GAO found that about 3 percent of pharmacies and other entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs for disposal have volunteered to do so. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) authorizes these entities to dispose of unused drugs to help reduce their potential misuse. Analysis of DEA data shows that as of April 2017, 2,233 of the 89,550 (2.49 percent) eligible entities—that is, certain entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances—had registered with DEA to use disposal bins to collect unused prescription drugs. Most—about 81 percent—of the authorized collectors were pharmacies, followed by hospitals or clinics. GAO also found that participation rates varied by state, though in 44 states less than 5 percent of the state's pharmacies and other eligible entities had registered to become authorized collectors. Stakeholders cited several factors that may explain why relatively few pharmacies and other eligible entities have registered with DEA as authorized collectors of unused drugs. Most notably, stakeholders representing authorized collectors told GAO that because participation is voluntary, the cost associated with maintaining a disposal bin—which includes purchasing and installing the bin according to DEA requirements and paying for the destruction of its contents—is an important factor to weigh against potential benefits. DEA noted that availability of disposal by law enforcement agencies also contributes to low participation."], "length": 6844}
